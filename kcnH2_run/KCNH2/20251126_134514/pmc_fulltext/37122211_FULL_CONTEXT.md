## Pro-arrhythmic effects of gain-of-function potassium channel mutations in the short QT syndrome

### Abstract

The congenital short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare condition characterized by abbreviated rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals on the electrocardiogram and by increased susceptibility to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Although mutations to multiple genes have been implicated in the SQTS, evidence of causality is particularly strong for the first three (SQT1−3) variants: these result from gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode K+ channel subunits responsible, respectively, for the IKr, IKs and IK1 cardiac potassium currents. This article reviews evidence for the impact of SQT1-3 missense potassium channel gene mutations on the electrophysiological properties of IKr, IKs and IK1 and of the links between these changes and arrhythmia susceptibility. Data from experimental and simulation studies and future directions for research in this field are considered.This article is part of the theme issue ‘The heartbeat: its molecular basis and physiological mechanisms’.

### Introduction

Ion channelopathies arise owing to acquired or genetic ion channel dysfunction. Channelopathies involving cardiac ion channels include long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), rare forms of familial atrial fibrillation (fAF), some forms of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and the ‘short QT syndrome' (SQTS) [1,2]. A link between QT interval abbreviation (less than 400 ms) and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in humans was made in 1993 [3], although an association between abbreviated ventricular repolarization and SCD was recognized earlier in some species of kangaroo [4,5]. Shorter than normal QT intervals occur in approximately 35% of male humans with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) [6]. Acquired QT interval shortening can occur with catecholamines, acetylcholine, hyperthermia, hypercalcaemia and anabolic steroid use [7–11]. As a distinct congenital condition, the SQTS is a relative newcomer, being first reported in 2000 [11]. The prevalence of congenital SQTS appears to be low [12,13]. However, the condition is strongly linked to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and, importantly, to sudden death [13–15], with approximately 40% of cases initially presenting with cardiac arrest [16]. SQTS is characterized by abbreviated rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals and with poor rate-adaptation of the QT interval [13–15]. SQTS electrocardiograms (ECGs) often exhibit tall and narrow T waves, particularly in the precordial leads [13–15]. This article focuses on the congenital form of SQTS.

### Diagnostic criteria and genotyping

As highlighted elsewhere [17], there are a number of factors that complicate the diagnosis of congenital SQTS. For instance, while approximately 0.1% of the population have QTc intervals of less than 320 ms [18,19], it is difficult to state a clear cut-off between a healthy and pathologically short QT interval. Gollob and colleagues proposed diagnostic criteria that combine QTc and Jpoint−Tpeak interval measurement with patient and family information [20]. Subsequently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) developed simplified criteria which suggest that a diagnosis of SQTS can be made with a QTc interval of less than or equal to 340 ms [21]; a longer QTc of less than or equal to 360 ms can be used if there is a family history of SQTS or SCD before 40 years of age, a pathogenic mutation has been identified, or there has been survival from ventricular tachycardia of fibrillation without structural heart disease [21]. A recent study of a Korean adult cohort with QTc intervals of less than or equal to 340 ms found early repolarization, tall T waves, U waves and QT dispersion to be greater in those with a short QT interval compared to controls. A short QT interval, as defined in that study, was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular arrhythmia/sudden arrest [22]. This appears to be consistent with the suggested ESC diagnostic QTc values. It has been highlighted that the method of QT correction to derive QTc values can influence diagnosis and it follows that measurements at low/resting heart rates are likely to be particularly useful [17,23]. Notably, it is not possible to rely strongly on the identification of pathogenic mutations in diagnosing SQTS, because genotyping is successful in less than 30% of cases [13,20]. A significant question arises as to whether or not diagnosis should be limited to a ‘pure' SQTS phenotype or whether it should take into account evidence that SQTS may sometimes be part of an ‘overlap syndrome', coexisting with BrS, SSS or early repolarization syndrome (ERS) phenotypes [12,24–26]. This issue is not merely of theoretical interest: it has practical implications. Nine different genes have been implicated in the SQTS (table 1 and [17]), but a recent study has suggested that only four of these have adequate evidence to be causally linked to SQTS [31]. In that study, independent teams studied the evidence for gene involvement using the ClinGen gene curation framework; as a result of their evaluations KCNH2 (also known as hERG; human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene) was definitively linked to SQTS, while KCNQ1, KCNJ2 and SLC4A3 were considered to have moderate to strong evidence for causal involvement [31]. In highlighting a ‘disputed' classification for CACNA1C, CACNA2D1, CACNB2 and SCN5A, these authors noted a lack of an SQTS phenotype in isolation for patients with mutations in these genes, as a BrS ECG pattern occurs accompanied by abbreviated QT intervals [31]. Mutations in SLC22A5 (associated with primary systemic carnitine deficiency and QT abbreviation) were argued to cause a metabolic SQTS-mimic in which QT abbreviation occurs that is reversible on carnitine supplementation [31]. A recent investigation that aimed to identify ECG features for differentiation of SQTS in patients of less than 20 years of age has highlighted that QTc and Jpoint-Tpeak values (obtained with Bazett's correction) of less than 316 ms and 181 ms, respectively, and the presence of early repolarization may aid identification of SQTS in children and adolescents [32]. The concurrence of abbreviated QTc interval with early repolarization noted in this report [32] highlights the potential significance of overlapping phenotypes. From the perspective of ion channel biology, it is unsurprising that mutations can lead to overlapping phenotypes, as the net consequences of an ion channel mutation will depend on the precise changes to current amplitude and kinetics that occur, and this could lead to a continuum of effects. Nevertheless, the remainder of this review will principally focus on links between KCNH2/hERG, KCNQ1 and KCNJ2 and short QT syndrome as these potassium channel genes can be causally linked to SQTS with a high degree of confidence. Of successfully genotyped SQTS variants involving mutations to K+ or Ca2+ channel genes, it has been estimated that more than 80% of patients had mutations to these genes (55.5% had hERG mutations, 11.1% had KCNQ1 mutations and 14.8% had KCNJ2 mutations) [33]. Thus, consideration of K+ channel mutations linked to SQTS covers the majority of successfully genotyped cases.

### The SQT1 variant and mutations to hERG

hERG encodes a protein responsible for the pore-forming subunit of tetrameric IKr channels [34,35]. The potassium current carried by hERG and native IKr channels is characterized by very rapid, voltage-dependent inactivation that limits current at positive membrane potentials [34–37]. Consequently, hERG/IKr normally contributes little to early repolarization of ventricular action potentials (APs), with its contribution growing as the AP plateau descends and inactivation is relieved ([36,38,39] and figure 1a,b). The ability of hERG channels to generate rapid outward current transients in response to depolarizations applied late during AP repolarization/early in diastole means that IKr can also provide some protection against unwanted premature excitation [44].

The first genetically identified form of SQTS (the ‘SQT1' variant) was reported in 2004 [45]. Candidate gene screening identified heterozygous base substitutions in members of two different families that led to the same missense mutation (N588K) in the external S5-Pore linker region of the channel (figure 1e). Members of both families had markedly abbreviated QT intervals (QTc of less than 300 ms) and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; there were instances of sudden death without obvious structural abnormalities [45]. A subsequent study identified the same mutation in a different family with paroxysmal AF, abbreviated atrial and ventricular refractory periods and inducible VF [46]. The S5-Pore linker region of hERG is thought to be involved in the channel's rapid inactivation process [47–49] and patch clamp analysis of the N588K mutation has demonstrated that it results in a very marked rightward voltage shift in inactivation [50,51]. The net consequence of this is that hERG/IKr current rises much earlier during the ventricular AP, as it is not limited by the rapid inactivation that normally occurs. A larger outward current occurring earlier during the AP [45,50,51] results in AP abbreviation [52–55]. The N588K hERG mutation has been found in approximately 18.5% of genotyped SQTS cases [33]. Fourteen years after identification of the N588K mutation in SQT1, a pore mutant that produces a very similar attenuation of inactivation was reported [56]. The S631A mutation (figure 1e) had been studied previously in the investigation of the inactivation mechanism of hERG [57]. Its clinical relevance was established in a family in which a 6-year-old girl was screened following sudden death of a cousin [56]. She was found to have the S631A mutation and a QTc interval of less than 320 ms. Her father and sister also had the mutation and abbreviated QTc intervals (less than or equal to 340 ms). The girl was asymptomatic until a much later episode of syncope, as a result of which she received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) [56]. Like the N588K mutation, S631A-hERG shows a profound attenuation of inactivation over physiologically relevant voltages [57] and under ventricular AP voltage clamp this produces an inverted ‘U' or domed shape current [58,59].

The most commonly identified SQTS (and SQT1) mutation to date is the T618I hERG mutation, which has been found in multiple SQTS families and accounts for 25.9% of genotyped cases [33,60]. The T618 residue is located at a highly conserved site in the pore-loop of the hERG channel (figure 1e) and is strongly associated with ventricular arrhythmia, although in contrast with N588K it has not yet been linked to AF [33,61]. From patch clamp data obtained at room temperature, it has been suggested that negatively shifted voltage-dependent and accelerated time dependent activation contribute to the gain-of-function effect of the T618I hERG mutation [33]. However, data at physiological/near physiological temperature have shown a modest positive voltage-shift in activation [62–64] and an attenuation of voltage-dependent inactivation, albeit to a more modest extent than occurs for S631A or N588K mutations which is likely to substantially underlie the gain-of-function phenotype [60,63,64]. The current generated through T618I hERG during APs appears quite sensitive to the profile of the AP waveform and recent AP clamp data raise the possibility that the lack of reported AF with this mutation may reflect a reduction in gain-of-function during atrial compared to ventricular AP waveforms [64]. The mutation may also promote ventricular-Purkinje fibre differences in repolarizing IKr, which may in turn contribute to U waves seen in carriers of this mutation [33,64]. Both T618I and N588K mutations also alter the generation of rapid transient currents in response to premature depolarizing stimuli [64,65].

The I560T hERG mutation was reported in a 64-year-old man who presented with palpitations and near syncope owing to AF and atrial flutter; his brother and father had died suddenly. Genetic screening revealed the I560T mutation in the S5 domain of hERG (figure 1e); the mutation was absent in genomic DNA of 200 controls [12]. This mutation leads to a positive shift in the voltage-dependence of inactivation and slowed time-course of inactivation and accelerated activation, also to increased ‘window' current as well as a modest decrease in K+ over Na+ selectivity [12,66]. Examination of the location of the I560 residue in the hERG protein structure suggested that the residue is oriented away from the pore towards membrane lipid, but it may interact with adjacent residue M561 and thereby influence interactions between S5 and the pore helix [66]. Two further SQTS-linked hERG mutations, E50D and R1135H have also been reported [20,67,68]. The N terminal E50D mutation (figure 1e) was observed in a 22-year-old man who lost consciousness when driving. He had a QTc interval of 366 ms, with poor rate adaptation of the QT interval [67]. The E50D mutation has been suggested to increase hERG ‘tail' current magnitude, slow deactivation time-course and produce a modest (approx. 11–12 mV) positive shift in voltage-dependent inactivation [69]. The C terminal R1135H mutation (figure 1e) was found in a 34-year-old man with a mixed BrS/SQTS phenotype (QTc interval of 329 ms). His mother and brother had QTc intervals of less than 380 ms; his brother had a non-documented arrhythmia and his mother had bradycardia [70]. The R1135H mutation was described as increasing hERG current amplitude and slowing deactivation [70]. In silico simulations have demonstrated that fewer channels close during diastole with slowed deactivation with this mutant; this increases the contribution of hERG/IKr early during APs and may increase the likelihood of all-or-none right ventricular repolarization [24]. The R1135H example nicely illustrates the potential for BrS/SQTS overlap owing to a mutation's effects on current kinetics. It is notable in this regard that other hERG mutations that increase hERG current, but do not produce voltage-shifts in inactivation kinetics, have been reported in BrS patients with QTc intervals less than 390 ms [71].

Computational simulations of the effects of the N588K mutation have provided insight into arrhythmia mechanisms in SQT1 [54,55,72–74]. As S631A-hERG exhibits comparable attenuation of inactivation to that seen with N588K [75], results of simulations based on N588K-hERG data are likely to also apply in the setting of the S631A mutation. In ventricular simulations, incorporation of N588K-attenuated inactivation led to marked abbreviation of AP duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) [55]. In multicellular simulations, the N588K mutation augmented δV (membrane voltage heterogeneity) in localized regions of the ventricular wall, contributing to T wave changes and facilitating vulnerability to re-entry. Simulations at two-dimensional and three-dimensional levels highlighted a marked decrease in the minimal substrate size required to sustain re-entry, resulting in increased lifespan durations for induced spiral or scroll waves ([55] and figure 2). Incorporation of N588K into atrial cell and tissue simulations has also shown mutation-induced abbreviation of APD and ERP, shortened excitation wavelength and increased scroll wave lifespan and dominant frequency [76,77]. In electromechanically coupled human ventricle cell models, incorporation of the N588K mutation reduced [Ca2+]i transients and contractile force, while in three-dimensional ventricle models the timing of maximum deformation (contraction) was delayed by N588K compared to wild-type IKr [72]. A subsequent clinical report was published in which SQTS patients were investigated with Doppler imaging and speckle tracking electrocardiography; this showed some decrease in left ventricular contraction and increased mechanical dispersion in SQTS patients compared to healthy controls [78–80]. Computational analysis of the effects of the I560T mutation has also shown abbreviation of ventricular APD and simulated QT intervals [12]. In tissue simulations, sustained re-entry was not observed under control conditions, but incorporation of I560T-induced effects led to sustained spiral wave re-entry [12].

Upper panels show shifted current voltage relation (left panel) and augmented current and altered current profile during ventricular AP (right panel). In simulations of human ventricular APs, the changes to IKr lead to abbreviated AP duration (APD) in epicardium (EPI), midmyocardium (MCELL) and endocardium (ENDO) and to augmented transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) [55,74]. At the tissue level, the QT interval becomes abbreviated and T wave amplitude increased. These changes increased susceptibility of ventricular tissue to ventricular tachycardia (VT)/fibrillation (VF) (bottom panels).

### The SQT2 variant and mutations to KCNQ1

The KCNQ1 protein (also known as KvLQT1 and Kv7.1) combines with KCNE1 (alternative nomenclature minK) to form functional IKs channels [81,82]. In undiseased human cardiomyocytes, IKs exhibits slow activation and fast deactivation kinetics [83] and is recognized to be a key component of ‘repolarization reserve' ([84–86] see also figure 1a,c). Its contribution to AP repolarization is augmented under conditions of β adrenoceptor activation [87]. Loss-of-function KCNQ1 mutations are well-established to underlie the LQT1 form of LQTS [88]. The first KCNQ1 mutation identified in the SQTS (SQT2) was V307L, which lies within the P-loop of the KCNQ1 protein (figure 1f); the mutation was found in a 70-year-old male who experienced an episode of aborted sudden death [89]. When co-expressed with KCNE1, V307L-KCNQ1 channels have been shown to pass current with negative-shifted voltage-dependent activation, modestly accelerated activation time-course and slowed deactivation time-course [89,90]. The augmented IKs that results from these changes has been shown to be causally linked to accelerated ventricular repolarization and arrhythmogenesis in silico ([91,92] and figure 3). The V141M mutation produces a more severe alteration to IKs and was first reported in a case of in utero bradycardia and irregular rhythm [93]. The V141 residue is located in the S1 domain of the KCNQ1 protein (figure 1f). The V141M mutation produces an instantaneous component of IKs and computational modelling showed ventricular AP abbreviation and cessation of pacemaking activity [93]. Subsequent to the original report, the V141M mutation has been confirmed to be linked to a mixed AF/sinus bradycardia phenotype [12,93–95]. In an in silico comparison of the consequences of the V307L and V141M mutations, both led to atrial AP abbreviation with a greater effect of V141M than V307L. However, only the V141M KCNQ1 mutation significantly altered sinoatrial nodal pacemaking rate, because it has a more marked effect on IKs over the diastolic depolarization membrane potential range [96]. Moreover, although both V307L and V141M mutations promoted re-entry in atrial tissue simulations, they produced different effects on the steepness of restitution of atrial AP duration, with V141M leading to stable, stationary spiral waves and V307L leading to non-stationary unstable waves [96].

The F279I mutation occurs at a residue located in the S5 segment of the KCNQ1 protein (figure 1f) and was identified in a 23-year-old male with a QTc interval of 356 ms and a familial history of sudden death [97]. Functional analysis of F279I KCNQ1 in the presence of KCNE1 revealed a negative shift in the voltage dependence of IKs activation and accelerated activation kinetics. Further insight came from co-immunoprecipitation and FRET measurements, which showed that the ability of KCNQ1 to coassemble with KCNE1 is impaired by the F279I mutation [97]. Computational modelling demonstrated AP abbreviation as a result of F279I-induced changes to IKs [97]. More recently, a second mutation (F279C) at the same residue position (figure 1f) was identified from genetic screening of a 10-year-old girl who experienced, but survived sudden cardiac arrest during a vacation [27]. Her initial in-hospital ECG showed a QTc of 383 ms, but telemetry and serial ECG measurement showed a minimal QTc of 344 ms. Genetic screening identified three variants of uncertain significance to RYR2, TTN and KCNQ1. The RYR2 variant was predicted to be tolerated by in silico prediction tools and was found also to be present in some population databases. The TTN variant was also identified in a population database [27]. The KCNQ1 variant was not found in any population database and had not been reported previously in disease. F279 has been shown to interact with F232 in a study employing cysteine mutagenesis that showed F232 and F279 are jointly responsible for gating modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE1 [98]. In the presence of KCNE1, F279C channels exhibited negatively shifted voltage-dependent activation compared to wild-type KCNQ1 [98]. This is consistent with a gain-of-function effect [27].

The R259H KCNQ1 mutation (figure 1f) was first reported in a study of suspected SQTS in which genetic screening was conducted of 42 probands and three affected relatives of deceased probands. The affected individual had experienced an aborted cardiac arrest and had a QTc interval of 316 ms [16]. It was also subsequently reported in a Chinese SQTS proband from screening 25 probands and family members for mutations to genes for ion channels that influence ventricular repolarization [99]. In patch clamp experiments, R259H KCNQ1 augmented IKs density and accelerated activation time-course and slowed deactivation, but did not significantly alter the voltage dependence of current activation [99]. The A287T KCNQ1 mutation was identified from genetic testing of a female patient who had survived cardiac arrest following VF [28]. Three years after implantation of an ICD an episode of VF occurred that was successfully cardioverted [28]. Electrophysiological measurements from A287T-KCNQ1 and KCNE1 coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes showed increased current amplitude and accelerated activation time-course compared to wild-type KCNQ1 [28]. Structural analysis showed that the position of the A287 residue (at the top of S5; figure 1f) allows it to form a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group of residue T322 at the top of S6, which may influence gating [28]. The results of molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the A287 residue is important for both correct selectivity filter structure and interaction with KCNE1 [28]. A further KCNQ1 mutation, I274V, may also be associated with SQTS [100]. This mutation was identified from genetic screening of genomic DNA from 201 cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) [101]. Functional analysis showed increased magnitude of I274V KCNQ1 + KCNE1 current compared to that from channels incorporating wild-type KCNQ1, while it also produced a modest acceleration of current activation and slowed current deactivation [100]. Incorporation of the effects of this mutation in ventricular AP simulations led to marked AP abbreviation [100]. These observations are strongly consistent with an SQTS phenotype; however, the absence of ECG data preclude definitive diagnosis as SQTS.

### The SQT3 variant and mutations to KCNJ2

The inwardly rectifying K+ current, IK1, plays important roles in maintaining the resting potential and in terminal repolarization of the ventricular AP [81,82]: as the amplitude of IKr declines, that of IK1 increases dominating the final repolarization phase ([86,102] figure 1a,d). The channels that mediate IK1 are comprised of Kir2.x subunits, with KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 strongly expressed in both atria and ventricles [103,104]. Loss-of-function KCNJ2 mutations underlie Andersen-Tawil syndrome (also known as the LQT7 form of LQTS [105]). The first KCNJ2 mutation reported to underlie the SQT3 form of SQTS was identified in a 5-year-old girl from whom an abnormal ECG was obtained during routine physical examination [53]: a short QTc interval of 315 ms and a narrow, asymmetric T wave with a rapid terminal phase. The girl's father had a history of palpitations on presyncopal events. Genetic analysis revealed no mutations in either hERG or KCNQ1, but a KCNJ2 variant was identified that led to a missense mutation (D172N) in Kir2.1 [53]. The inward rectification of the potassium current carried by Kir2.1 arises owing to a voltage-dependent block of the channel by polyamines and Mg2+ ions and the D172 residue (figure 1g) is implicated in Mg2+ and polyamine binding [106]. The D172N mutation impairs this process and results in increased outward current, with a modest positive shift in the voltage at which peak outward current occurs, though does not eliminate current rectification entirely [53,106,107]. Ventricular AP simulations in the study reporting the D172N variant showed steeper APD restitution and AP abbreviation involving increased steepness of terminal repolarization [53]. One-dimensional tissue strand simulations reproduced the T wave morphology seen in the proband [53]. Subsequent independent simulations at one- to three-dimensional tissue levels showed that incorporation of D172N mutant IK1 abbreviated APD and ERP and steepened both APD and ERP restitution. Tissue excitability was increased at high rates [108]. Temporal vulnerability to initiation of re-entry was enhanced, while minimal substrate size required for re-entry maintenance was decreased for the D172N mutant [108]. Further simulations using electro-mechanically coupled ventricle models showed some theoretical potential for the D172N mutation to adversely influence contractile force [72].

The M301K mutation in Kir2.1 (figure 1g) was found in an 8-year-old girl with a QTc interval of 194 ms and AF that was unresponsive to intravenous procainamide [109], who underwent electrical cardioversion. AF and VF were inducible on electrophysiological testing [109]. The M301 residue is located in the C terminus of the Kir2.1 protein, is highly conserved and the M301K mutation was absent in 400 control alleles [109]. When the M301K protein was expressed alone, it failed to produce functional channels, but when co-expressed with wild-type Kir2.1 (which reflected the heterozygous status of the patient) outward current was increased over a wide range of potentials [109], with a more marked loss of rectification than reported earlier for the D172N mutation [53,107]. Recently, the predominant microRNA (miR) in the heart, miR1, has been found to bind to Kir2.1 and suppress IK1 carried by wild-type Kir2.1 at sub picomolar concentrations; this effect was absent for channels incorporating M301K Kir2.1 [110]. This constitutes a potential additional factor that contributes to the gain-of-function effect of this SQTS mutation.

The K346T mutation (figure 1g) was found in 9-year-old identical twins with epilepsy and behavioural impairment who also showed an abbreviated QTc interval in ECG measurements (QTc of 331 ms), with narrow peaked T waves [111]. The K346 residue is highly conserved and the mutation was absent in 400 ethnically matched control chromosomes and in large polymorphism databases [111]. Recordings of Kir2.1 currents from Xenopus oocytes were made using high (90 mM) external potassium and the K346T mutation was found to augment inward current under these conditions. Additional measurements made using mammalian cell line expression and more physiological recording conditions showed increases to both inward and outward currents for K346T Kir2.1 channels. The increased current occurred without significant alterations to unitary slope conductance [111]. This mutation also appears to increase Kir2.1 protein stability by decreasing Kir2.1 ubiquitination and degradation [111].

The E299V Kir2.1 mutation (figure 1g) was found in an 11-year-old boy with recurrent paroxysmal AF and mild left ventricular dysfunction [112]. Holter monitoring showed an average ventricular response of 98 beats per minute during paroxysms of AF. At a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, the QT interval was 200 ms and the QT-heart rate relation was flat, showing poor rate adaptation of the QT interval [112]. The E299V mutation was absent in the boy's parents and in 400 controls [112]. Expression and subcellular distribution of the E299V protein were similar in vitro, and there was no sign of any trafficking defect for E299V Kir2.1. However, in patch clamp analysis, E299V channels (expressed either alone or with wild-type Kir2.1) showed large increases in outward current over most of the physiological range of membrane potentials. AP voltage clamp experiments showed large Kir2.1 current increases at both APD5 and APD50 timepoints [112]. Ventricular AP simulations comparing effects of the E299V and D172N mutations showed much greater APD abbreviation with the former mutation and a profound flattening of the APD90 rate relationship, consistent with the marked effects of E299V throughout the AP [112]. In ventricular tissue simulations of heterozygous E299V Kir2.1 the S1-S2 protocol interval that produced re-entry was shifted to towards shorter intervals and sustained re-entry with twice the frequency possible for wild-type tissue was observed. Introduction of the mutation into three-dimensional ventricle simulations introduced left-right asynchronicity of excitation (excitation of the two ventricles via conduction of the sinus beat via the His bundle and distal Purkinje fibre system was synchronous in the wild-type condition, but for the right ventricle was delayed in the E299V condition). In atrial simulations profound AP shortening and flat APD­90-rate relations were observed [112]. It proved difficult to elicit re-entry in tissue simulations using an S1-S2 protocol with wild-type Kir2.1, but with E299V present windows of vulnerability to re-entry were seen. For both the E229V and D172N Kir2.1 mutations the causal link between mutation-induced changes to IK1 and abbreviated repolarization has also been verified experimentally using the dynamic clamp technique, in which application to cardiomyocytes in real-time of mutation-induced changes to IK1 has been shown to abbreviate APD [113,114].

### Evidence for an overlap syndrome involving increased KATP channel activity?

A recent study highlights the potential for SQTS to overlap with ERS and raises the possibility that other cardiac K+ currents than IKr, IKs and IK1 might contribute to SQTS [115]. An adult (27 years) male presented at the doctor owing to frequent episodes of syncope several weeks following electrocution at work. ECG analysis showed an ERS phenotype together with an abbreviated QTc interval of 326 ms, consistent with concomitant SQTS. Programmed electrical stimulation evoked arrhythmias and arrhythmia inducibility was exacerbated by procainamide administration, necessitating electrical cardioversion [115]. On genetic analysis (next generation sequencing), six heterozygous exonic mutations were found, three of which were predicted to be damaging: R3634D in ANK2 (Ankyrin-B); D26N in PKP2 (Plakophilin 2) and R663C in ABCC9 (SUR2). A KCNA5 encoded A251T mutation to Kv1.5 was predicted to be tolerated and a short deletion mutation found in HCN2 would not be anticipated to influence repolarization of ventricular tissue. Patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were produced from fibroblasts and differentiated into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Measurements from these were compared with those from a wild-type iPSC-CM line. Field potential recordings showed an absence of a pseudo-QRS complex in myocytes derived from the patient and voltage clamp analysis showed a significant reduction in fast Na+ current (I­Na). This may have been linked to the PKP2 mutation in the patient [115]. Importantly, the duration of spontaneous APs from patient derived myocytes was markedly shorter than that from control myocytes [115]. This occurred despite a reduced spontaneous rate (and hence longer cycle length); at a consistent pacing rate, the extent of AP abbreviation might be greater than that reported from spontaneous AP recording. SUR2 combines with Kir6.x channels to form KATP channels [81,82], which are usually silent under normoxic conditions. The abbreviated APs in iPSC-CMs from the patient could be prolonged by the application of the KATP inhibitor glibenclamide. This suggests that the SUR2 R663C mutation could have led to constitutively active KATP channels in the patient, which led to QT interval abbreviation [115]. Direct recordings of KATP current in expression studies of channels incorporating the SUR2 R663C mutation would be valuable to investigate further the phenotype observed in this study. The reason why syncope only appeared after electrocution, despite the presence of these mutations throughout life, remains unexplained. Nevertheless, this recent report provides interesting evidence implicating KATP channels in producing an abbreviated QTc interval phenotype and this warrants further study.

### Insights into arrhythmia mechanisms from experimental models

The foregoing discussion has highlighted pro-arrhythmic mechanisms in K+ channel mutation linked SQTS identified through computational modelling. It is valuable also to consider insights into arrhythmogenesis in SQTS from experimental studies. Years before the possibility emerged that mutations to KATP channel subunits might contribute clinically to an SQTS phenotype, the KATP channel opener pinacidil was used as a tool to produce an experimental SQTS phenotype in the canine ventricular wedge preparation and rabbit perfused hearts [116–118]. Pinacidil shortened repolarization, abbreviated ERP, increased transmural heterogeneity of repolarization and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia [116–118]. The hERG/IKr channel opener PD118057 produced similar effects in the canine ventricular wedge preparation [119]. The first genetic model of SQTS was the reggae zebrafish mutant, in which a mutation to the S4 domain of the zebrafish hERG homologue zERG (L499P) produced increased repolarizing current and abbreviated compound action potentials and QTc intervals [120]. Analysis of alterations to current kinetics of the equivalent mutation (L532P) in hERG has shown a moderate positive shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation and alterations to activation/deactivation kinetics leading to a marked increase in repolarizing current and altered current timing during the ventricular AP [120,121]. To date, this mutation has not been detected in human SQTS.

A significant advance in recent years has been the development of a transgenic rabbit model of SQT1 produced through expression of a human transgene for N588K-hERG [122]. This model exhibits abbreviation of QTc intervals, atrial and ventricular APs and of ERP. Ventricular arrhythmias could readily be induced in N588K-hERG expressing perfused hearts [122]. Intriguingly, some electrical remodelling of other currents was observed, including a decrease in IK1 and increase in IKs [122]. An increase in T wave height (as occurs in SQT1 patients) was not reported and while diastolic relaxation was enhanced altered systolic function was not observed [122]. Nevertheless, the SQT1 rabbit very largely recapitulates human SQT1 and highlights similar arrhythmia mechanisms to those predicted from simulations.

Human iPSC-CMs have been generated for both the N588K and T618I hERG SQT1 mutations [123–125]. A recognized limitation with iPSC-CMs is their relatively immature, spontaneously active phenotype, in which IK1 is small or absent [126,127]. Thus, while N588K-SQT1 hiPSC-CMs exhibit increased IKr and abbreviated APs, they are spontaneously active; abnormal Ca2+ transients after-depolarization events were seen in these cells that were worsened by carbachol application [123]. On the one hand, this highlights a potential trigger for arrhythmia under conditions of parasympathetic stimulation, while on the other, the relevance of such findings to what happens in mature cardiomyocytes is uncertain. Intriguingly, some remodelling of ion channel messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was found in N588K-hiPSC-CMs, with upregulation for CACNA1C, hERG and KCND3 + KChIP2, but no changes in mRNA for KCNQ1 and KCNJ2 [123]. Further work has been conducted using a combination of single cell recording and measurements from two-dimensional sheets of N588K-SQT1 hiPSC-CMs [125]. Patch clamp recording from single cells showed increased IKr and abbreviated repolarization and refractoriness. Consistent with prior simulation work and transgenic rabbit data, optical mapping experiments on SQT1 two-dimensional myocyte sheets highlighted abbreviated excitation wavelength, altered rate adaptation of APD and increased inducibility of spiral waves of increased stability and frequency [125]. It is reassuring that different experimental and simulation approaches have revealed similar mechanisms of proarrhythmia in this form of SQT1 [128]. Patient derived iPSC-CMs harbouring the T618I hERG mutation exhibit increased IKr, abbreviated APs and increased beat-to-beat variability in spontaneous AP firing pattern (with regular spontaneous activity in control iPSC-CMs and AP bursts with interspersed pauses in T618I-hERG-hiPSC-CMs) [124]. Such spontaneous firing patterns have no direct correlate in mature cardiac myocytes. T618I-hiPSC-CMs exhibit significant remodelling in ion channel genes and it is notable that membrane expression of hERG protein was increased for T618I-hiPSC-CMs compared to controls [124].

### Treatment

Given the risk of sudden death in SQTS, ICDs have been used extensively in management of the syndrome [14,129–132]. Potential T wave oversensing can be managed through device reprogramming [130]. However, although ICDs may prevent death they do not normalize repolarization or arrhythmia substrates. The mainstay of pharmacological treatment of SQTS is the Class Ia antiarrhythmic quinidine [13,132,133]. ESC guidelines from 2015 give a class IIb recommendation (may be considered) for quinidine and sotalol for patients with SQTS who qualify for an ICD but have a contraindication for or refuse ICD use [21]. These drugs may also be considered for use in asymptomatic patients with a family history of sudden death [21]. A recent (2022) update to these guidelines retains these recommendations for quinidine, though not for sotalol [134]. From an ion channel pharmacology perspective, both quinidine and sotalol should be effective at delaying repolarization through hERG/IKr block in forms of SQTS other than SQT1. However, sotalol and ibutilide were found to be ineffective in cases of SQT1, while quinidine normalized repolarization and protected against arrhythmia [45,135,136]. The ineffectiveness of pure class III hERG blocking drugs in SQT1 with severe hERG inactivation impairment can be explained by the dependence of these drugs on an intact inactivation process to bind optimally to the hERG channel [75,136–138]. By contrast quinidine and another class Ia drug disopyramide have comparatively little dependence on intact hERG inactivation to bind and are effective inhibitors of hERG channels with SQT1 linked mutations [60,63,66,75,137,139]. Quinidine has been found to be effective in experimental models of SQTS (reviewed in [13,128]) and in simulations is effective in prolonging repolarization across SQT1-SQT3 settings [140]. Multiple simulation and experimental studies have now been conducted that have investigated potential alternative/additional pharmacotherapeutic strategies in SQTS and detailed consideration of these is beyond the scope of this article. For further consideration of potential SQTS treatments, the reader is referred to [12–14,33,61,132,133,141].

### Conclusion and future directions

The existence of SQT1–3 underscores the importance of IKr, IKs and IK1 for human ventricular repolarization. Although the individual mutations considered in this review have distinct effects on the function of different K+ channels, common consequences of the different K+ channel gain-of-function mutations considered here are abbreviated ventricular repolarization and refractoriness and increased vulnerability to initiation and maintenance of re-entry. In cases where a channelopathy arises owing to mutations in identified ion channel genes, characterization of gene variants using a combination of heterologous expression and computational modelling is likely to continue to provide significant insight into whether or not an identified ion channel gene variant is pathogenic [142]. However, the relatively low success of targeted genetic screening in the SQTS indicates involvement of additional genes to those that are routinely screened for electrical disorders. It is possible that some SQTS cases may arise owing to mutations in genes that encode modifiers of channels involved in repolarization rather than ion channels themselves. Some cases may be polygenic. Such causes may not be readily identified through targeted gene screening and addressing this challenge may require the use of whole exome/genome approaches, followed by functional validation of putative modifier genes. The field is currently somewhat limited by a relative lack of genetically accurate animal models of different forms of SQTS. Ideally, future progress in this direction will involve targeted modification of endogenous channel genes. The use of such animal models will be important both to validate predictions from computational modelling, to investigate facets such as remodelling and effects of modifier genes that are difficult to study in heterologous expression and simulations alone, and to investigate novel therapeutic approaches. Patient-specific iPSC-CMs are likely to assume increasing importance in the interrogation of SQTS (and other primary electrical disorders), both in exploring causation and potential genetic correction. While the immaturity of iPSC-CMs and consequent spontaneous electrical activity at present impose some limitations on the interpretation of findings using patient-derived iPSC-CMs, at the single cell level at least, the lack of a stable resting potential can be remedied through electronic IK1 application with dynamic clamp [64,113,143]. The development of improved maturation approaches will ultimately be of high value in the employment of iPSC-CMs, not least in the interrogation of patient-specific treatment approaches and in the further exploration of novel approaches to modulating repolarization, such as miRNA treatment and optogenetics [144–146]. A recent systematic literature review has suggested the existence of some sex differences in SQTS features [147], specifically a predominance of syncope among males and a higher risk of arrhythmic events or SCD at diagnosis and during follow up in females. The role of sex hormones in modifying arrhythmia mechanisms/substrates in the SQTS remains to be investigated. Future systematic investigation of how identified SQT1-3 K+ channel mutations interact with autonomic modulation is also likely to be profitable.
