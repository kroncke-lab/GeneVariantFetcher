## Long QT molecular autopsy in sudden unexplained death in the young
(1-40 years old): Lessons learnt from an eight year experience in New
Zealand

### Abstract

BackgroundTo review long QT syndrome molecular autopsy results in sudden unexplained
death in young (SUDY) between 2006 and 2013 in New Zealand.MethodsAudit of the LQTS molecular autopsy results, cardiac investigations and
family screening data from gene-positive families.ResultsDuring the study period, 365 SUDY cases were referred for molecular autopsy.
128 cases (35%) underwent LQTS genetic testing. 31 likely pathogenic
variants were identified in 27 cases (21%); SCN5A (14/31,
45%), KCNH2 (7/31, 22%), KCNQ1 (4/31,
13%), KCNE2 (3/31, 10%), KCNE1 (2/31, 7%),
KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). Thirteen variants (13/128, 10%) were
ultimately classified as pathogenic. Most deaths (63%) occurred during
sleep. Gene variant carriage was more likely with a positive medical history
(mostly seizures, 63% vs 36%, p = 0.01), amongst females (36% vs 12%, p =
0.001) and whites more than Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Children 1–12
years were more likely to be gene-positive (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02). Family
screening identified 42 gene-positive relatives, 18 with definitive
phenotypic expression of LQTS/Brugada. 76% of the variants were maternally
inherited (p = 0.007). Further family investigations and research now
support pathogenicity of the variant in 13/27 (48%) of gene-positive
cases.ConclusionIn New Zealand, variants in SCN5A and
KCNH2, with maternal inheritance, predominate. A rare
variant in LQTS genes is more likely in whites rather than Maori, females,
children 1–12 years and those with a positive personal and family history of
seizures, syncope or SUDY. Family screening supported the diagnosis in a
third of the cases. The changing classification of variants creates a
significant challenge.

### Introduction

Sudden unexplained death in the young (SUDY) has devastating psychological and social
effects in the community and in the surviving family members. Standard forensic
examination fails to identify a cause in up to half of the cases, which can
sometimes be attributed to an underlying inherited arrhythmia. [1, 2]

Cardiac ion channelopathies such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic
polymorphic tachycardia (CPVT) and Brugada syndrome can have their first
presentation as SUDY. Death can be prevented; the challenge is to identify
pre-symptomatic individuals in the community. Since these conditions are usually
familial, their detection amongst the deceased potentially allows family members to
be identified and protected. The hallmark studies of Behr et al and
Tan et al [3, 4] demonstrated
that cardiac investigation of family members can lead to a diagnosis in the deceased
in up to 40% of cases. Another approach is the use of genetic testing from the
decedent’s DNA, the so called “molecular autopsy”. [5]

In New Zealand, a combined approach of these two methods was adopted in 2006.
Sequencing of LQTS genes 1, 2, 3 (SCN5A, also associated with
Brugada syndrome), 5, 6, and 7 was offered free of charge to the National Forensic
Service in SUDY cases (age 1–40 years). Results of the first 26 months of analysis
showed that molecular autopsy identified mutations and rare variants in LQTS/Brugada
genes in 15% of the individuals in whom no diagnosis had been made using standard
assessment. [6] Our group was
pleased to be part of the largest study yet of sudden death in the young, from
Australia and New Zealand, showing that with a widened molecular autopsy, up to 27%
of unexplained deaths are associated with “clinically actionable” genetic variants,
in a large number of genes. [7] It will take some years before we know for sure whether these have
wide family significance, or are truly pathogenic by co-segregation. With
continuation of the clinical service in New Zealand for a total of 8 years, and a
further two years follow up, we aim with this study to focus on the long QT
molecular autopsy and assess its diagnostic yield and the impact on family screening
both in terms of the value to the families, and its effect on the final
interpretation of the genetic variants we identified.

### Methods

New Zealand has an established inherited heart disease and sudden death registry with
ethical approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (HDEC
reference AKX/02/00/107/AM03). This is a signed consent-based registry where
patients or legal guardians of patients under 18 and/or their next of kin gave
approval for research into their cardiac condition and consented to the publication
of anonymised clinical and genetic data. Since this is an audit from that registry
HDEC waived the requirement for ethical approval for the present study. The report
has also been approved by the chief coroner for New Zealand. [6, 8] A coordinated network of clinicians and
scientists known as the Cardiac Inherited Disease Group (CIDG) provides clinical and
diagnostic genetic services throughout New Zealand for families with inherited heart
disease. We reviewed all cases of autopsy-negative SUDY who have undergone genetic
testing for LQTS/Brugada since the beginning of the work in 2006 until December
2013. Funding for testing prior to 2008 was from charitable support, and after that
was government funded via the Ministry of Justice. Previously reported cases are
included in our analysis. [6]
SUDY was defined as an unexpected fatal event in an apparently healthy subject or
whose disease was not expected to be the cause of death, having occurred between the
ages of 1 and 40 years-old.

Genetic testing of the LQTS genes linked to types 1, 2, 3
(SCN5A, also associated with Brugada syndrome), 5, 6 and 7 was
performed as previously described by our group and by collaborating clinical
service laboratories. [6,
9] Since 2007,
screening for rarer deletions and duplications by using multiplex
ligation-dependent probe amplification initially and later by array comparative
hybridization was included in the analysis and performed in cases where no
mutations have been detected by initial sequencing. [10] Genetic variants in the LQTS/Brugada
genes were assessed for potential pathogenicity by using a multifaceted approach
involving evidence from the literature and mutation databases, in
silico analysis with predictive bioinformatics programs PolyPhen 2
[11] and SIFT, [12] in
vitro functional analyses when possible and familial cascade
screening. Cases that were found to have an established or potentially
pathogenic rare variant using the tools described above were selected. During
the timeframe of the study, some of the genetic variants were initially
described as potentially pathogenic by our group based on the information
available at the time, but with ongoing investigations locally and overseas, and
family screening pathogenicity of some variants came into question and were
down-graded. All cases were reviewed by CIDG and the conclusion as whether the
SUDY case was a consequence of LQTS/Brugada syndrome was described as
follows:

Highly probable and probable: there was enough evidence based on clear
pathogenicity of the genetic variant, circumstances of death, previous
medical history and family history, including screening and
co-segregation analysis to support the channelopathy as the cause of
death.

Possible: pathogenicity of the rare variant was detected by one or more
methods described above and circumstances of death were compatible, but
there was not enough evidence from previous medical history, family
history and family screening.

Uncertain: pathogenicity of the novel genetic variant has not been
demonstrated with the methods described above and family screening was
uninformative or is still ongoing.

Unlikely: there was no clear evidence of pathogenicity using the methods
described above or the variant was later found to be a common
polymorphism.

Family screening was defined as supportive, partially supportive or not
supportive of the diagnosis of a putative channelopathy depending on the results
of co-segregation analysis.

### Molecular autopsy and assessment of pathogenicity

Genetic testing of the LQTS genes linked to types 1, 2, 3
(SCN5A, also associated with Brugada syndrome), 5, 6 and 7 was
performed as previously described by our group and by collaborating clinical

### Results

From September 2006 until December 2013, 365 SUDY cases were referred for
autopsy. Amongst them, 128 (76 males, 59%) were autopsy-negative and therefore
referred for molecular autopsy. A total of 31 genetic variants was found in 27
cases (21%), with 9/76 (12%) males and 19/52 (36%) females having a positive
genetic test (p = 0.001). Four males had two genetic variants each. In 13/27
(48%) of the gene-positive cases the genetic variants were deemed pathogenic
(i.e.: 13/128 (10%) of all SUDY cases) and the consequent channelopathy highly
probably or probably the responsible for the subject’s demise–we classified
these cases as “final gene-positives” for distinction. In the other 14 cases,
current investigations have not yet been able to ascertain whether the variant
and consequent channel dysfunction was the cause of death. In addition, some of
the variants initially classified by CIDG as likely pathogenic were later
down-graded to variants of uncertain significance or polymorphisms and therefore
were unlikely to be responsible, on their own, for the SUDY cases (Fig 1). Tables 1 and 2 compare the characteristics of all
gene-positive and final gene-positive with gene-negative cases.

New Zealand Europeans (Caucasians) were the majority in both groups; however the
proportion of New Zealand Europeans in the gene-positive group was significantly
higher (78% vs 42%, p = 0.001). Interestingly, Maori was the second most common
ethnicity amongst gene-negative patients but none of the patients in the
gene-positive group were Maori (31% vs 0, p = 0.0009). Other ethnicities did not
differ between groups.

The mean age of death did not differ between gene-positive and gene-negative
cases. Males in the gene-positive group were younger but the difference did not
reach statistical significance. The majority of gene-positive cases were in the
older age group between 25–40 years when including all cases, but the likelihood
of being gene-positive was higher between 1–12 years (33% vs 14%, p = 0.02),
which increased for the “final gene-positive” group (54% vs 14%, p = 0.004,
Fig 2). The opposite was
seen for the age group between 13–24 years with a higher proportion being
gene-negative (8% vs 46%, p = 0.007). No difference was seen for the older age
group (25–40 years).

Circumstances of death did not differ between gene-positive and gene-negative
cases. The majority of events happened during sleep (unwitnessed nocturnal
deaths) in both groups, followed by daytime events. There were two deaths
related to competitive sports in the gene-positive cohort (both during the
activity) and four in the gene-negative cohort (two deaths during the activity
and two immediately after).

Relevant past medical history was more prevalent amongst gene-positive cases (63%
vs 36%, p = 0.01). History of seizures/epilepsy was the most prevalent past
medical history reported in both groups, with no difference between
gene-positive and gene-negative.

Relevant family history was more common amongst gene-positive cases but only
significant when comparing the “final gene-positive” group with gene-negative
(54% vs 26%, p = 0.04). History of seizures/epilepsy in family members, as well
as SUDY and/or sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) did not differ between
groups.

*15p duplication

Variants in the SCN5A gene were the most common (14/31, 45%),
followed by KCNH2 (7/31, 22%) and KCNQ1 (4/31,
13%). Variants were less common in KCNE2 (3/31, 10%),
KCNE1 (2/31, 7%) and KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). One
case, a 12 year old boy with diabetes presented in detail elsewhere [13] was tested for
GPD1-L and was positive, but we have not included his case
in our current analysis.

SCN5A variants were the most common amongst both females
(6/18, 33%) and males (4/9, 44%). Three males had two variants each in the
SCN5A gene. Four out of the 13 “final gene-positive”
cases had an SCN5A variant (31%). Two SCN5A variants were
associated with a LQTS type 3 phenotype (cases 2 and 15) and 1 with a
Brugada phenotype (case 6) according to previous reports, circumstances of
death and family screening. One of the variants (case 23) was found in
addition to a pathogenic KCNH2 variant and was deemed
benign as described below. The cases described below highlight particular
issues our service has faced with defining pathogenicity.

Cases 1 and 20 had a variant (R1193Q) which has proven in vitro effect on
channel function and has been linked to Brugada syndrome but is now
recognised as a common polymorphism in Han Chinese. [15] Family screening was declined by
one family of Chinese descent; in the other no phenotypic features of
LQTS/Brugada were identified with cascade screening.

Case 4 had two novel variants (D546G and Y1950H), the former assessed as
probably damaging/not tolerated on in silico analysis.
Family screening did not contribute to establish or refute pathogenicity as
one relative who was gene-positive for both variants had negative cardiac
investigations including Ajmaline test. However, the deceased died during
sleep and had a history of multiple febrile seizures, so a functional defect
in the SCN5A gene cannot be ruled out as the cause of
death.

Cases 6 and 16 had a variant (F2004L) linked to Brugada syndrome, [15] SUDI, [16] sudden death in
women [17] and as a
common polymorphism. [15] Case 6 had abnormal ante-mortem ECGs with features of
Brugada syndrome and had documented VT/VF cardiac arrest. One of the parents
declined genetic test but had a positive Ajmaline test, which in our view
corroborates the pathogenicity of this variant in this family. Case 16 also
carried the H558R polymorphism, which has been speculated to influence the
functional phenotype of the F2004L variant. [18] The decedent had a previous history
of epilepsy and atrial fibrillation. The H558R polymorphism has also been
reported in association with lone atrial fibrillation. [19] Because of these
characteristics we did not believe we could exclude a sodium channelopathy
as the cause of death despite the fact that family screening did not
contribute to elucidate pathogenicity of the variant in this family.

Case 13 had an intronic variant (c.612-2A>G) previously described in
association with Brugada syndrome. [15] However, family screening
identified two relatives with the same variant and negative cardiac
investigations, including Ajmaline test, so we believe the genetic variant
was not pathogenic in this family.

Case 23 had a novel intronic variant (c.2436+12G>A) which was not
predicted to affect splicing and was deemed non-damaging/tolerated on
in silico analysis. The other variant found in
KCNH2 has been described as likely pathogenic by
previous reports. [15] Family screening revealed 10 gene-negative relatives, all with
normal cardiac investigations. The decedent’s mother died of a cardiac
arrest in the post-partum period, which is strongly suggestive of LQTS type
2.

Variants in KCNH2 were found in 5/18 females (28%) and 2/9
males (22%). The results are shown in Table 4. Our main challenges here were
related to small family size, but in some there was reasonably strong
support by phenotype/genotype co-segregation. An example is case 12 who had
a deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation (G749Afs*8). Six family
members were found to have the same mutation with four having definite
abnormal cardiac investigations.

KCNQ1 variants were more common in males (3/9, 33%), with
only 1 female affected.

Case 5 had a variant (E146K) previously described as linked to LQTS. [15] Family screening
revealed four gene-positive cases with normal cardiac investigations, all
adults. One other child who died suddenly during infancy was found to have
the same variant. We hypothesise that this might be a developmental variant
associated with death during infancy/childhood which loses its pathogenicity
in adulthood. [9]
Cases 7, 8 and 9 all had variants previously described as pathogenic [15] and family cascade
screening was supportive of the diagnosis of LQTS.

Two KCNE1 variants were found in 2/18 females (11%) and no
males.

Case 11 had a variant (R67H) previously reported as cause of LQTS, [15] but family
screening did not support or refute the likelihood of pathogenicity. Case 26
had a variant (R98W) reported as pathogenic [15] and family screening revealed other
gene-positive relatives with abnormal cardiac investigations.

KCNE2 variants were found in 1/9 male (11%) and 2/18 females
(11%). After our investigations we are not confident of pathogenicity in any
of these cases, though we remain suspicious regarding two of them.

Case 10 was found to have a rare variant (T8A) previously reported as cause
of drug-induced arrhythmia. [15] In addition, he had two previously reported common
polymorphisms in KCNH2 and KCNE1 genes. At
the time of death he was not taking any medications, but he died whilst
swimming. It was unclear whether the combination of LQTS gene variants found
in this male could have contributed to his death. Family screening revealed
one gene-positive relative with borderline cardiac investigations as well
one gene-negative with normal cardiac investigations.

Case 18 had the same variant as case 10. Cardiac investigations were
suggestive of LQTS in two relatives, but the family declined genetic
testing.

Case 27 was found to have a deletion in 17q24.3, which encompasses the
KCNJ2 gene. Defects in KCNJ2 have been
linked to Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) [14] and novel mutations have been
described in two families with LQTS without the ATS phenotype. [20] This female had a
previous history of epilepsy and an abnormal ECG in life with a prolonged
corrected QT on review of medical records. Her mother was found to carry the
same deletion and has abnormal cardiac investigations. This case was
reported previously our group. [10]

Screening was performed in 24 families (2 families were living overseas and 1
declined). A total of 148 family members were screened with either standard
cardiac investigations alone (64/148, 44%) or in combination with genetic test
(84/148, 56%). Amongst the ones that had genetic test, 42/84 (50%) were
gene-positive. Definite LQTS or Brugada syndrome was diagnosed in 18/148 family
members (12%), 13/18 (72%) females and 5/18 (28%) males. Seventeen families had
genetic tests performed in both parents of the decedent. The genetic variant was
maternally inherited in 13/17 families (76%) and paternally inherited in 4/17
(24%). Family cascade screening helped establish pathogenicity of the variant in
10/24 (41%) families. Therefore 10/27 variants (37%) were upgraded to “final
gene positives” supported by family cascade screening.

### Comparison between gene-positive and gene-negative groups

From September 2006 until December 2013, 365 SUDY cases were referred for
autopsy. Amongst them, 128 (76 males, 59%) were autopsy-negative and therefore
referred for molecular autopsy. A total of 31 genetic variants was found in 27
cases (21%), with 9/76 (12%) males and 19/52 (36%) females having a positive
genetic test (p = 0.001). Four males had two genetic variants each. In 13/27
(48%) of the gene-positive cases the genetic variants were deemed pathogenic
(i.e.: 13/128 (10%) of all SUDY cases) and the consequent channelopathy highly
probably or probably the responsible for the subject’s demise–we classified
these cases as “final gene-positives” for distinction. In the other 14 cases,
current investigations have not yet been able to ascertain whether the variant
and consequent channel dysfunction was the cause of death. In addition, some of
the variants initially classified by CIDG as likely pathogenic were later
down-graded to variants of uncertain significance or polymorphisms and therefore
were unlikely to be responsible, on their own, for the SUDY cases (Fig 1). Tables 1 and 2 compare the characteristics of all
gene-positive and final gene-positive with gene-negative cases.

New Zealand Europeans (Caucasians) were the majority in both groups; however the
proportion of New Zealand Europeans in the gene-positive group was significantly
higher (78% vs 42%, p = 0.001). Interestingly, Maori was the second most common
ethnicity amongst gene-negative patients but none of the patients in the

(54% vs 26%, p = 0.04). History of seizures/epilepsy in family members, as well
as SUDY and/or sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) did not differ between
groups.

Variants in the SCN5A gene were the most common (14/31, 45%),
followed by KCNH2 (7/31, 22%) and KCNQ1 (4/31,
13%). Variants were less common in KCNE2 (3/31, 10%),
KCNE1 (2/31, 7%) and KCNJ2 (1/31, 3%). One
case, a 12 year old boy with diabetes presented in detail elsewhere [13] was tested for
GPD1-L and was positive, but we have not included his case
in our current analysis.

SCN5A variants were the most common amongst both females
(6/18, 33%) and males (4/9, 44%). Three males had two variants each in the
SCN5A gene. Four out of the 13 “final gene-positive”
cases had an SCN5A variant (31%). Two SCN5A variants were
associated with a LQTS type 3 phenotype (cases 2 and 15) and 1 with a
Brugada phenotype (case 6) according to previous reports, circumstances of
death and family screening. One of the variants (case 23) was found in
addition to a pathogenic KCNH2 variant and was deemed
benign as described below. The cases described below highlight particular
issues our service has faced with defining pathogenicity.

Cases 1 and 20 had a variant (R1193Q) which has proven in vitro effect on
channel function and has been linked to Brugada syndrome but is now
recognised as a common polymorphism in Han Chinese. [15] Family screening was declined by
one family of Chinese descent; in the other no phenotypic features of
LQTS/Brugada were identified with cascade screening.

Case 4 had two novel variants (D546G and Y1950H), the former assessed as
probably damaging/not tolerated on in silico analysis.
Family screening did not contribute to establish or refute pathogenicity as
one relative who was gene-positive for both variants had negative cardiac
investigations including Ajmaline test. However, the deceased died during
sleep and had a history of multiple febrile seizures, so a functional defect
in the SCN5A gene cannot be ruled out as the cause of
death.

Cases 6 and 16 had a variant (F2004L) linked to Brugada syndrome, [15] SUDI, [16] sudden death in
women [17] and as a
common polymorphism. [15] Case 6 had abnormal ante-mortem ECGs with features of
Brugada syndrome and had documented VT/VF cardiac arrest. One of the parents
declined genetic test but had a positive Ajmaline test, which in our view
corroborates the pathogenicity of this variant in this family. Case 16 also
carried the H558R polymorphism, which has been speculated to influence the
functional phenotype of the F2004L variant. [18] The decedent had a previous history
of epilepsy and atrial fibrillation. The H558R polymorphism has also been
reported in association with lone atrial fibrillation. [19] Because of these
characteristics we did not believe we could exclude a sodium channelopathy
as the cause of death despite the fact that family screening did not
contribute to elucidate pathogenicity of the variant in this family.

Case 13 had an intronic variant (c.612-2A>G) previously described in
association with Brugada syndrome. [15] However, family screening
identified two relatives with the same variant and negative cardiac
investigations, including Ajmaline test, so we believe the genetic variant
was not pathogenic in this family.

Case 23 had a novel intronic variant (c.2436+12G>A) which was not
predicted to affect splicing and was deemed non-damaging/tolerated on
in silico analysis. The other variant found in
KCNH2 has been described as likely pathogenic by
previous reports. [15] Family screening revealed 10 gene-negative relatives, all with
normal cardiac investigations. The decedent’s mother died of a cardiac
arrest in the post-partum period, which is strongly suggestive of LQTS type
2.

Variants in KCNH2 were found in 5/18 females (28%) and 2/9
males (22%). The results are shown in Table 4. Our main challenges here were
related to small family size, but in some there was reasonably strong
support by phenotype/genotype co-segregation. An example is case 12 who had
a deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation (G749Afs*8). Six family
members were found to have the same mutation with four having definite
abnormal cardiac investigations.

KCNQ1 variants were more common in males (3/9, 33%), with
only 1 female affected.

Case 5 had a variant (E146K) previously described as linked to LQTS. [15] Family screening
revealed four gene-positive cases with normal cardiac investigations, all
adults. One other child who died suddenly during infancy was found to have
the same variant. We hypothesise that this might be a developmental variant
associated with death during infancy/childhood which loses its pathogenicity
in adulthood. [9]
Cases 7, 8 and 9 all had variants previously described as pathogenic [15] and family cascade
screening was supportive of the diagnosis of LQTS.

Two KCNE1 variants were found in 2/18 females (11%) and no
males.

Case 11 had a variant (R67H) previously reported as cause of LQTS, [15] but family
screening did not support or refute the likelihood of pathogenicity. Case 26
had a variant (R98W) reported as pathogenic [15] and family screening revealed other
gene-positive relatives with abnormal cardiac investigations.

KCNE2 variants were found in 1/9 male (11%) and 2/18 females
(11%). After our investigations we are not confident of pathogenicity in any
of these cases, though we remain suspicious regarding two of them.

Case 10 was found to have a rare variant (T8A) previously reported as cause
of drug-induced arrhythmia. [15] In addition, he had two previously reported common
polymorphisms in KCNH2 and KCNE1 genes. At
the time of death he was not taking any medications, but he died whilst
swimming. It was unclear whether the combination of LQTS gene variants found
in this male could have contributed to his death. Family screening revealed
one gene-positive relative with borderline cardiac investigations as well
one gene-negative with normal cardiac investigations.

Case 18 had the same variant as case 10. Cardiac investigations were
suggestive of LQTS in two relatives, but the family declined genetic
testing.

Case 27 was found to have a deletion in 17q24.3, which encompasses the
KCNJ2 gene. Defects in KCNJ2 have been
linked to Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) [14] and novel mutations have been
described in two families with LQTS without the ATS phenotype. [20] This female had a
previous history of epilepsy and an abnormal ECG in life with a prolonged
corrected QT on review of medical records. Her mother was found to carry the
same deletion and has abnormal cardiac investigations. This case was
reported previously our group. [10]

### SCN5A

SCN5A variants were the most common amongst both females
(6/18, 33%) and males (4/9, 44%). Three males had two variants each in the
SCN5A gene. Four out of the 13 “final gene-positive”
cases had an SCN5A variant (31%). Two SCN5A variants were
associated with a LQTS type 3 phenotype (cases 2 and 15) and 1 with a
Brugada phenotype (case 6) according to previous reports, circumstances of
death and family screening. One of the variants (case 23) was found in
addition to a pathogenic KCNH2 variant and was deemed
benign as described below. The cases described below highlight particular
issues our service has faced with defining pathogenicity.

Cases 1 and 20 had a variant (R1193Q) which has proven in vitro effect on
channel function and has been linked to Brugada syndrome but is now
recognised as a common polymorphism in Han Chinese. [15] Family screening was declined by
one family of Chinese descent; in the other no phenotypic features of
LQTS/Brugada were identified with cascade screening.

Case 4 had two novel variants (D546G and Y1950H), the former assessed as
probably damaging/not tolerated on in silico analysis.
Family screening did not contribute to establish or refute pathogenicity as
one relative who was gene-positive for both variants had negative cardiac
investigations including Ajmaline test. However, the deceased died during
sleep and had a history of multiple febrile seizures, so a functional defect
in the SCN5A gene cannot be ruled out as the cause of
death.

Cases 6 and 16 had a variant (F2004L) linked to Brugada syndrome, [15] SUDI, [16] sudden death in
women [17] and as a
common polymorphism. [15] Case 6 had abnormal ante-mortem ECGs with features of
Brugada syndrome and had documented VT/VF cardiac arrest. One of the parents
declined genetic test but had a positive Ajmaline test, which in our view
corroborates the pathogenicity of this variant in this family. Case 16 also
carried the H558R polymorphism, which has been speculated to influence the
functional phenotype of the F2004L variant. [18] The decedent had a previous history
of epilepsy and atrial fibrillation. The H558R polymorphism has also been
reported in association with lone atrial fibrillation. [19] Because of these
characteristics we did not believe we could exclude a sodium channelopathy
as the cause of death despite the fact that family screening did not
contribute to elucidate pathogenicity of the variant in this family.

Case 13 had an intronic variant (c.612-2A>G) previously described in
association with Brugada syndrome. [15] However, family screening
identified two relatives with the same variant and negative cardiac
investigations, including Ajmaline test, so we believe the genetic variant
was not pathogenic in this family.

Case 23 had a novel intronic variant (c.2436+12G>A) which was not
predicted to affect splicing and was deemed non-damaging/tolerated on
in silico analysis. The other variant found in
KCNH2 has been described as likely pathogenic by
previous reports. [15] Family screening revealed 10 gene-negative relatives, all with
normal cardiac investigations. The decedent’s mother died of a cardiac
arrest in the post-partum period, which is strongly suggestive of LQTS type
2.

### KCNH2

Variants in KCNH2 were found in 5/18 females (28%) and 2/9
males (22%). The results are shown in Table 4. Our main challenges here were
related to small family size, but in some there was reasonably strong
support by phenotype/genotype co-segregation. An example is case 12 who had
a deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation (G749Afs*8). Six family
members were found to have the same mutation with four having definite
abnormal cardiac investigations.

### KCNQ1

KCNQ1 variants were more common in males (3/9, 33%), with
only 1 female affected.

Case 5 had a variant (E146K) previously described as linked to LQTS. [15] Family screening
revealed four gene-positive cases with normal cardiac investigations, all
adults. One other child who died suddenly during infancy was found to have
the same variant. We hypothesise that this might be a developmental variant
associated with death during infancy/childhood which loses its pathogenicity
in adulthood. [9]
Cases 7, 8 and 9 all had variants previously described as pathogenic [15] and family cascade
screening was supportive of the diagnosis of LQTS.

### KCNE1

Two KCNE1 variants were found in 2/18 females (11%) and no
males.

Case 11 had a variant (R67H) previously reported as cause of LQTS, [15] but family
screening did not support or refute the likelihood of pathogenicity. Case 26
had a variant (R98W) reported as pathogenic [15] and family screening revealed other
gene-positive relatives with abnormal cardiac investigations.

### KCNE2

KCNE2 variants were found in 1/9 male (11%) and 2/18 females
(11%). After our investigations we are not confident of pathogenicity in any
of these cases, though we remain suspicious regarding two of them.

Case 10 was found to have a rare variant (T8A) previously reported as cause
of drug-induced arrhythmia. [15] In addition, he had two previously reported common
polymorphisms in KCNH2 and KCNE1 genes. At
the time of death he was not taking any medications, but he died whilst
swimming. It was unclear whether the combination of LQTS gene variants found
in this male could have contributed to his death. Family screening revealed
one gene-positive relative with borderline cardiac investigations as well
one gene-negative with normal cardiac investigations.

Case 18 had the same variant as case 10. Cardiac investigations were
suggestive of LQTS in two relatives, but the family declined genetic
testing.

### KCNJ2

Case 27 was found to have a deletion in 17q24.3, which encompasses the
KCNJ2 gene. Defects in KCNJ2 have been
linked to Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS) [14] and novel mutations have been
described in two families with LQTS without the ATS phenotype. [20] This female had a
previous history of epilepsy and an abnormal ECG in life with a prolonged
corrected QT on review of medical records. Her mother was found to carry the
same deletion and has abnormal cardiac investigations. This case was
reported previously our group. [10]

### Family screening

Screening was performed in 24 families (2 families were living overseas and 1
declined). A total of 148 family members were screened with either standard
cardiac investigations alone (64/148, 44%) or in combination with genetic test
(84/148, 56%). Amongst the ones that had genetic test, 42/84 (50%) were
gene-positive. Definite LQTS or Brugada syndrome was diagnosed in 18/148 family
members (12%), 13/18 (72%) females and 5/18 (28%) males. Seventeen families had
genetic tests performed in both parents of the decedent. The genetic variant was
maternally inherited in 13/17 families (76%) and paternally inherited in 4/17
(24%). Family cascade screening helped establish pathogenicity of the variant in
10/24 (41%) families. Therefore 10/27 variants (37%) were upgraded to “final
gene positives” supported by family cascade screening.

### Discussion

New Zealand was the first country in the world to routinely provide molecular autopsy
as part of a clinical cardiac genetic investigative service for SUDY. The first 26
months of this work demonstrated that the LQTS molecular diagnostic hit rate of 15%
was somewhat lower in this population-based cohort than in a previous selected
cohort. [21] Since that time,
other centres around the world have incorporated genetic testing on the deceased
into their investigations, although it remains far from routine. Countries such as
the Netherlands and parts of the UK have pioneered cardiac investigation of the
family, supported by genetic testing in living family members, as a means to achieve
diagnosis in the deceased.

In 2008 members of the Trans-Tasman Response AGAinst sudden Death in the Young
(TRAGADY) put forward guidelines to ensure standardization of autopsy practice in
cases of SUDY. [22] This was
endorsed locally by the Heart Foundation of New Zealand, Human Genetic Society of
Australasia and the Royal Australasian College of Pathologists. The key features of
this document were the performance of a thorough autopsy by an appropriately
experienced pathologist, the early involvement of the family in the investigations,
storage of tissue suitable for extraction of high quality DNA and referral to a
cardiac genetic service. The essence of these guidelines has subsequently been
adopted by the Heart Rhythm Society and the European Heart Rhythm Association.
[23] This document formed
a basis from which a recent bi-national study of young sudden death could progress.
[7]

There remains however much to learn about in whom genetic testing is most valuable,
whether it leads helpfully to a diagnosis in other family members and the relative
benefits of the investigation of the family versus testing of the deceased. All of
this occurs in the background of rapidly evolving and expanding genetic testing
possibilities.

Of 365 sudden death cases referred to our multidisciplinary review panel, only 128,
about one third, were finally put forward for molecular autopsy and family cardiac
evaluation of first degree relatives. Cases were rejected for cardiac genetic
evaluation on a number of grounds, with each case being different. Common examples
include a positive toxicology result, evidence of significant co-morbidity, such as
coronary artery disease or morbid obesity and hypertensive vascular changes, or
florid myocarditis on histology. The constant scrutiny of autopsy reports, with
ready access to second opinion, has led to an undoubted improvement in the quality
of the reports, which at the start of the experience were often poor or incomplete.
[24] Families of patients
with another inherited heart disease at autopsy were also investigated, and genetic
testing has often been done on the decedent, aimed at the disease concerned.

Of the 128 tested we found that one fifth of autopsy-negative SUDY cases carried a
mutation or variant in the LQTS genes. From the start it has been a real challenge
to define confidence in pathogenicity. Since 2006 much research has been done
internationally, and many variants have been redefined from one level to another.
There were no whole exome control populations at the start of this work. We decided
to present our case series including those where a variant has been redefined
because this is the real-life scenario that every service will have to come to terms
with as such services develop. It is worthy of note that some variants may be benign
or malignant depending on one’s ancestry. Rare variants in SCN5A
are particularly challenging. In some cases such as the two year-old with nocturnal
death and two variants (case 4), one is left with a sense that the channelopathy
will have played a part, yet we cannot prove it. Perhaps they had a role like
functional SNPs are postulated to do in SUDI, [18, 25] possibly with down-regulation of vulnerable
channels by environmental factors [26] and other polymorphisms. [27] Overall, considering the 13 genetic
variants ultimately classified as highly probably pathogenic, the minimum yield of
molecular autopsy for this panel of genes was 10%. It is essential for the cardiac
genetic service to have an open and frank, ongoing dialogue with the affected
families and the forensic or coronial services. Most if not all families, once
engaged with the service, appreciate the effort and attention that is given to them,
and are able to accept a level of uncertainty when counseled appropriately.

We aimed to see if we could learn which cases are most likely to give a positive
yield. Comparing variant-positive with negative cases, the proportion of females was
significantly higher in the positive group. Caucasians were the majority in both
groups, likely reflecting the population distribution in New Zealand. However, the
proportion of Caucasians in the positive group was significantly higher and
interestingly none of the cases in the positive cohort were of Maori ethnicity.
According to a previous publication from our service, [8] the percentage of self-declared Maori
amongst the population with LQTS in the Northern region of New Zealand was 22%,
compared to 66% Caucasians. Considering that the Maori ethnic group accounts for
approximately 15% of the total New Zealand population, it appears that Maori are
proportionally represented amongst the living population with LQTS, but
under-represented amongst the SUDY cohort. Further research is needed to establish
the genetic profile and unique characteristics of the Maori population.

The majority of all variant-positive cases were in the older age group (25–40 years).
However, if we only include the cases where we remain confident of pathogenicity,
the proportion of final gene-positive cases in the youngest group (1–12 years) was
significantly higher.

Death during sleep did not differ between variant-positive and negative cases. Two
thirds of the variant positive cases died during sleep. The LQTS screen includes the
SCN5A gene, linked to Brugada syndrome as well as LQTS type 3.
These conditions classically cause sudden death in young adult males. Despite the
majority of autopsy-negative SUDY cases being males, genetic testing in our cohort
had a threefold higher yield of rare variants in females, particularly over 25.
Interestingly, most cases were maternally inherited. Given these are autosomal
dominant conditions; it is as yet unclear how this maternal inheritance might
somehow confer increased malignancy of the channelopathy. This finding is, however,
in keeping with previous studies [28, 29] and one
potential explanation could be that epigenetic factors such as imprinting could be
responsible for transmission distortion of LQTS genes.

Positive past medical history was significantly more prevalent in the
variant-positive group. In a third of the cases sudden death was the first
presentation of their condition. This is a recognised phenomenon, particularly with
Brugada syndrome and LQTS type 3. A positive medical history was found in the
remainder two thirds, implying that an opportunity to diagnose and prevent the death
has been overlooked. Epilepsy and/or seizures, rather than standard cardiovascular
symptoms such as palpitations were the most common medical history. Cerebral hypoxia
as a consequence of low cardiac output causes seizures. As previously reported in
the literature, including by our group, [30] incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy is common
in patients with LQTS. This present report suggests that awareness of this fact
still needs to be raised in order to avoid these tragic outcomes.

Mutations and rare variants in SCN5A and KCNH2 were
the most frequent, which is in keeping with a higher risk of sudden death at younger
ages for LQTS types 2 and 3. [31] All but one case of SCN5A gene positive died during
sleep, as expected.

Tester et al reported a high incidence of RyR2 mutations (linked to
CPVT) in their SUDY cohort, [5] and subsequently the standard molecular autopsy recommended including
RyR2 in the panel. [23] This test was not available to us
consistently over the reported time period. If we had we would have expected more
deaths during exercise or activity to be present in our gene-positive cohort.

Relevant family history was found in about half of the cases in which family history
could be obtained. There was a high prevalence of SUDY and/or SUDI and syncope was
the second most common diagnosis. None of the families had a previous diagnosis of
LQTS or had been investigated for an inherited cardiac disease at any time prior to
the demise of their relative. A high prevalence of positive family history of SUDY
without prior diagnosis has been described previously [32, 33] and unfortunately this is still a reality.
It confirms that awareness of the possibility of an inherited cardiac disease
following SUDY is still lacking for the majority of medical professionals who deal
with these families.

Family screening identified 18 individuals with LQTS and Brugada syndrome who are now
being appropriately managed. It also helped support the diagnosis of LQTS/Brugada
through co-segregation in just over a third of cases.

The high frequency of novel variants found by molecular autopsy means that evaluation
of family members is often required to confirm pathogenicity. We consider engagement
of the family to be an essential part of this autopsy investigative process, as
originally recommended by the TRAGADY document. As in our previous experience with
the investigation of SIDS we do not recommend molecular autopsy being performed as a
stand-alone test. [9]
Furthermore, the value of the test is of course greatly enhanced by its potential
use in family cascade screening.

The next phase of development of the molecular autopsy will be multiple gene panels
or whole exome/genome sequencing. Recent population studies using such technology
have led to a number of previously described likely pathogenic mutations being
reclassified as common polymorphisms. [34, 35] This new information led to a reduction in
the number of cases in our initial cohort with a highly probable or probable
diagnosis of LQTS or Brugada syndrome, as some of the variants initially found were
later reclassified. These findings enhance the importance of family engagement,
genetic counseling, and subsequent co-segregation studies to evaluate novel variants
within families.

The aim of our work is to prevent sudden deaths through identification of those at
risk in the community. We have shown previously that aggressive family cascade
screening of all probands, dead or alive, can lead to effective identification of
LQTS in the community. Half of the anticipated 1 in 2000 cases of LQTS have already
been identified in parts of New Zealand. [8] The approach described here is part of that
initiative.

The molecular autopsy was limited to assessment of variants in the LQTS genes and
only SCN5A for Brugada. This is a practical and fiscal issue,
faced by many countries across the world. We do not have routine access to
in-vitro assessment of genetic variants, and a limitation
of this study and the majority of studies that deal with genetic mutations is
the difficulty is attributing pathogenicity to a rare variant. This will only
become harder as wider genetic panels reveal more variants of uncertain
significance. [36] We
tried to use as many indicators of pathogenicity as possible, but a definite
correlation between a genetic variant and SUDY is not always straightforward and
new information can change a genetic variant from likely pathogenic to a common
polymorphism with definite implications for the families involved. This is why
family co-segregation is so important and is still ongoing for some of the
families in our cohort.

### Conclusion

The LQTS molecular autopsy contributed to a likely diagnosis in one fifth of SUDY
cases, although this was only confirmed in half of the cases by family screening and
further literature support. SCN5A and KCNH2
variants predominated. Whites, adult females and children aged 1–12 had the highest
yield of a positive genetic test in our cohort. There was also evidence that
mutations inherited maternally are over represented. Of those with a genetic
diagnosis, past medical history of syncope, seizures and/or epilepsy was common as
well as family history of sudden death. Family screening proved valuable in
detecting a significant number of affected family members and in providing
additional supportive evidence of pathogenicity of some of the rare variants
encountered.
