## Long-term Monitoring to Detect Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death in Inherited Arrhythmia Patients

### Abstract

BackgroundRisk stratification in inherited arrhythmia syndromes is challenging. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are effective in the prevention of sudden cardiac death but are associated with significant complications. We aimed to determine the value of long-term implantable loop recorder (ILR) monitoring to determine risk factors for arrhythmias in inherited arrhythmia patients.MethodsWe conducted a prospective multicentre study between 2015 and 2020 recruiting inherited arrhythmia probands and family members at intermediate arrhythmic risk, with no class 1 indication for ICD implantation. The primary endpoint was the detection by ILR of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia over ≥ 10 consecutive beats. Secondary endpoints included ICD insertion during follow-up, all-cause mortality, and ILR complication rates.ResultsA total of 45 individuals (30 female participants) were enrolled in the study. The most common diagnoses were long-QT syndrome (28%), Brugada syndrome (26%), and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (11%). Following ILR insertion (mean follow-up 633 days; range, 387-969), cardiac symptoms occurred in 19 of 45 patients (42%), 5 of whom had nonsustained ventricular tachycardias (11%), which were symptomatic in 3 individuals. This situation led to ICD implantation based on ILR in 5 of 45 patients (11%). Fifty percent of symptomatic events occurred in ARVC patients. The median time from ILR insertion to ICD implantation was 152 days (interquartile range (25th, 75th percentiles) 55 of 209). No patient experienced sudden cardiac death.ConclusionsILRs enable the detection of high-risk arrhythmic features and facilitate selection of ICD candidates in inherited arrhythmia patients with borderline indications.

### Methods

We conducted a prospective multicentre study, between 2015 and 2020, recruiting patients with IA syndromes from the cardiogenetic clinics of 4 tertiary Canadian centres. All patients are also part of the ongoing prospective Hearts in Rhythm Organization network, and all provided written informed consent.16

Baseline information was collected after informed consent was obtained. Data were analyzed based on standard clinical reports from implantable loop recorders (ILRs).

Individuals were eligible in the presence of one of the following inclusion criteria:

1. Individual with IA syndrome and breakthrough symptoms on best medical care that do not warrant an ICD. Breakthrough symptoms were defined as presyncopes, syncope, palpitation, or a clinical symptom that may be caused by an arrhythmia:a)Brugada syndrome (BrS) with inducible type 1 syndrome and syncope that was not clearly arrhythmic;Long QT syndrome (LQTS) or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) on a beta-blocker;b)LQTS with double pathogenic mutation (high-risk genetic substrate);c)Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with at least 2 minor or 1 major 2010 task force criteria, excluding asymptomatic gene carriers.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) with inducible type 1 syndrome and syncope that was not clearly arrhythmic;

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) on a beta-blocker;

LQTS with double pathogenic mutation (high-risk genetic substrate);

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with at least 2 minor or 1 major 2010 task force criteria, excluding asymptomatic gene carriers.

2. Patients symptomatic or not with relevant phenotypes, who did not warrant an ICD:a)Spontaneous persistent type 1 Brugada pattern;b)Macroscopic T wave alternates on resting electrocardiogram, Holter monitor, or exercise test;c)QTc > 500 msec in LQTS, other than LQT1;d)Persistent asymptomatic bidirectional couplets or nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in CPVT with exercise on therapy;e)High-risk unexplained cardiac arrest patients and family members, with 2 or more criteria as described.17

Spontaneous persistent type 1 Brugada pattern;

Macroscopic T wave alternates on resting electrocardiogram, Holter monitor, or exercise test;

QTc > 500 msec in LQTS, other than LQT1;

Persistent asymptomatic bidirectional couplets or nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in CPVT with exercise on therapy;

High-risk unexplained cardiac arrest patients and family members, with 2 or more criteria as described.17

The ILR used in this study was the Reveal LINQ (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Device insertion was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.18 The Medtronic Reveal LINQ is a programmable device that continuously monitors the patient’s rhythm, providing a single-lead electrocardiogram. For the automated recording settings, the manufacturer’s default settings were used, including automated detection of (i) atrial fibrillation (AF); (ii) extreme bradycardia (≥ 4 beats of the heart of 30 beats per minute (bpm) [2000 ms R-R interval]); (iii) tachycardia ≥ 120 bpm for ≥ 10 beats; and (iv) pause of ≥ 3 seconds. In addition, the device allows a patient-activated event recorder for a total of 30 minutes of recording time.

The monitoring result was correlated with clinical events, including symptom history (syncope and/or unexplained cardiac arrest) and family history of SCD (1st- or 2nd-degree relative, confirmed, or suspected sudden unexplained death). In the case of a recorded event, the rhythm analysis of the tracing was performed by the local investigator, and findings and their clinical implications were discussed with the patient. ICD therapy was prescribed according to current recommendations in patients with symptomatic VAs, or when sufficient asymptomatic VAs were detected to alter the risk-benefit ratio in favour of ICD therapy.19

The first visit was 4 weeks after ILR insertion, and the following visits then were every 6 months, either in person or by remote monitoring. Each follow-up visit included ILR interrogation, and assessment of any changes in clinical status. The minimal follow-up duration was 1 year, and all participants were followed for up to 3 years and/or to the end of device longevity.

The primary endpoint was the detection of ≥ 10 beats of nonsustained (< 30 seconds) ventricular tachycardia (NSVTs) at a rate of ≥ 120 bpm. Secondary endpoints included sustained ventricular arrhythmia (≥ 30 seconds), ICD implantation rate, and time after ILR insertion, mortality (cardiac and noncardiac, sudden, and non-sudden cardiac, as classified by the site investigator), and ILR complication rate (infection, pain defined by a visual analog scale > 4, premature removal).

Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR; 25th-75th percentile), as appropriate. Event-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimation. Statistical analysis was conducted using R Studio statistical software, version 1.2.5001, 2019 (RStudio, Inc., Vienna, Austria).

### Results

A total of 45 individuals (67% female participants) were enrolled in the study, including 27 probands (60%) and 18 first-degree family members (40%; Table 1). The principal indications for enrollment were being an IA patient with breakthrough symptoms that did not warrant an ICD (50%). Asymptomatic IA syndrome patients with relevant phenotypes accounted for 24% of ILR insertions, including 3 individuals with ARVC, 6 with BrS, and 2 with LQTS. Two individuals were double-mutation carriers with LQTS (KCNQ1 c.613 G > A; p.Val205Met and KCNH2 c.2690 A > C; p.Lys897Thr; Table 2).Table 1Baseline characteristicsCohort (n = 45)Age, y38 (28, 51)Male15 (33)Working diagnosis ARVC5 (11) CPVT2 (5) Brugada12 (26) Long QT13 (28) ERS1 (2) Malignant MVP1 (2) Other∗11 (24)Symptoms prior ILR implantation Presyncope11 (24) Syncope16 (35) Palpitation15 (33)Family history of SCD12 (26)Cardiac arrest1 (2)Continuous data (age) are expressed as median and interquartile range (25th, 75th percentiles).

The mean 5-year risk of a first VA for ARVC patients is 14% (range: 4.5% to 22.1%).

Overall, 52% of individuals were gene-positive, and 26% had a family history of unexplained SCD. Prior to ILR implantation, 74% of the study population presented cardiac symptoms, predominantly syncope (35%) or palpitations (33%). One patient had a recovered cardiac arrest of unknown cause.

After ILR insertion, the median follow-up duration was 635 days (IQR: 387, 969; Table 3). No complications were observed following the ILR implantation.Table 3Implantable loop recorder follow-upCohort (n = 45)Time, d635 (387, 969)Symptoms21 (48) Presyncope1 (5) Syncope5 (24) Palpitation4 (19) Chest pain1 (5) Mixed10 (47)NSVT6 (13)Medication change10 (22)ICD implant6 (13)ICD therapy0Cardiac arrest0Continuous data (time) are expressed as median and interquartile range (25th,75th percentiles).

Cardiac symptoms occurred in 19 of 45 patients (42%) during follow-up. Five patients (11%) had NSVTs, which were symptomatic in 3 individuals (Table 3; Fig. 2). The median delay between ILR insertion and recording of the first NSVT episode was 91 days (IQR: 35, 175; Fig. 2). A total of 16 of 21 patients (76%) had symptoms that were not related to arrhythmia episodes: 56% (59 of 16) had mixed symptoms (syncope or presyncope and palpitation); 25% (4 of 16) had syncope; and 19% (3 of 16) had palpitations (Fig. 3).Figure 2Clinical outcomes during implantable loop recorder (ILR) monitoring.

During follow-up, a change in medical therapy was implemented in 10 patients, and ICD implantation was implemented in 5 patients (Table 3). Among patients with cardiac events leading to the ICD implantation, 4 patients had NSVTs on ILR monitoring. Of these, one individual had received the ILR for unexplained syncope and had a family history of unexplained sudden death. He presented 3 symptomatic (syncopal) polymorphic NSVT episodes of < 10 seconds duration with very fast heart rates (222 bpm; Fig. 5). Two individuals with an ILR implanted for ARVC underwent insertion of an ICD: The first patient presented 2 symptomatic presyncopes related to a 25-second rapid polymorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia (Fig. 6); the second patient presented a short episode (< 10 seconds) of asymptomatic polymorphic rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia (222 bpm) and a symptomatic rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia (240 bpm) (presyncope and palpitations) with underdetection (counted as SVT) and spontaneous termination. Another patient with ILR insertion for malignant mitral valve prolapse experienced repeat episodes of short (< 10 seconds) and symptomatic (with palpitations) rapid polymorphic NSVT (201 bpm). One Brugada patient was without arrhythmia. No patient experienced cardiac arrest or SCD. One CPVT patient with asymptomatic NSVT did not have ICD implantation. One individual with familial SCN5A-related overlap syndrome, including BrS and hereditary conduction disease, experienced high-degree atrioventricular block with syncope. Given her family history, which included BrS with malignant ventricular arrhythmia, the responsible healthcare team discussed ICD implantation with the patient.Figure 5Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) episode detected by implantable loop recorder in patient with syncope of unknown cause with a family history of sudden cardiac death. bpm, beats per minute; Tachy, tachycardia; Term, terminated.Figure 6Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia episode detected by implantable loop recorder in one arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy patient. bpm, beats per minute; Tach, tachycardia; Term, terminated.

### Discussion

The present study is the first prospective study using ILRs for ambulatory long-term rhythm monitoring in individuals with inherited arrhythmia syndromes who did not qualify for preventive ICD insertion based on conventional stratification criteria. Key findings of the present study include the following: (i) NSVTs with high-risk features (ventricular response > 200 bpm) occurred in 9% of affected individuals; (ii) ILR-based ambulatory monitoring resulted in ICD insertion in 11% of study subjects; and (iii) modification of medication occurred in 22%.

Risk stratification of SCD remains challenging for many IA syndromes, given the overall low event rates in many disorders, the atypical warning symptoms, and the fact that a large proportion of cardiac events occur in individuals at low or intermediate risk, who represent the bulk of patients.20 Moreover, cardiac arrest may be the presenting symptom for various primary electrical disorders, and a substantial proportion of cardiac events occur in individuals with apparently low- to moderate-risk phenotypes.1, 2, 3, 4

Despite major advances in the understanding and management of IA syndromes, significant knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, resulting in a large gray zone of clinical risk prediction. For these situations, the indication for ICD insertion may be influenced largely by individual interpretation rather than scientific evidence. Our study began in 2015, prior to recent publications proposing prediction algorithms for ARVC patients to use to estimate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and guide decisions regarding primary prevention ICDs.21

The proven efficacy of ICD therapy must be balanced against the risk of long-term harm associated with ICD insertion.22 Patients with IA syndromes are typically younger and more active, and they are known to be at increased risk of device-related complications (> 25% at 5 years), including inappropriate shocks, hardware problems, or infections.7 The long time spent with devices in younger patients, together with the aforementioned complications, results in increased morbidity and significantly affects the quality of life of affected patients.22 In addition, the benefits of ICDs remain controversial in channelopathies such as LQTS and CPVT that are characterized by adrenergic triggers of ventricular arrhythmia. Previous studies have shown that ICD shocks in LQTS or CPVT potentially can sustain arrhythmic storms and sometimes may fail to prevent SCD.23 From a psychological point of view, ICD shocks often have devastating impacts on affected patients and their families.

ILRs are becoming more and more popular for identifying rare or sporadic arrhythmia episodes.24 Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of ILR in diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias in patients who experience recurrent syncope, palpitations, and cryptogenic strokes.25, 26, 27 ILRs also could be used as a diagnostic device in people with IA syndromes who are at risk of ventricular arrhythmia.28,29

In our study, the cumulative incidence of sustained ventricular tachycardia was 11% (5 of 45), all of which led to ICD implantation. Among implanted patients, one ARVC patient received an appropriate shock.

Despite a small cohort size, the results of our study revealed therapeutic consequences for 35% of enrolled patients over a span of only 2 years. Although at this point the impact is only speculative, longer monitoring periods are likely to result in even increased rates of actionable findings. In addition to the identification of electrophysiological high-risk features, the ILR insertion also allowed us an improved interpretation of atypical symptoms. In our study, 16 of 21 patients (76%) had symptoms not related to arrhythmia episodes. Three individuals had asymptomatic NSVT with high-risk features resulting in subsequent ICD insertion. For those patients, correct adjudication of atypical symptoms not only permits improved patient reassurance but also may avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. On the other hand, our observations also show that some individuals may experience asymptomatic warning events. Clearly, the poor correlation between clinical symptoms and potentially (sometimes subclinicall) arrhythmia warning signs remains a major challenge for the risk stratification of SCD.30

Previous data mainly come from retrospective studies, with follow-up period duration rarely exceeding 2 years. Symptoms are infrequent and are rarely associated with arrhythmic events in LQTS and CPVT patients receiving beta-blockers.30 Dwivedi et al. published a report on 45 AI patients who received ILR.31 No syncope in the whole cohort was related to malignant arrhythmias.31 Avari Silva et al. describe 9 patients with CPVT who received ILR. The prevalence of subclinical arrhythmias was significant, and only one patient had an upgrade to an ICD for symptomatic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.32

In BrS patients with a history of syncope, differentiation of probable arrhythmic syncope from neurally mediated syncope has been demonstrated to be associated with prognostic value.33 A recent retrospective, single-centre study showed, over a median follow-up period of 28 months, the usefulness of ILR in guiding the management of intermediate-risk BrS patients and determining the cause of unexplained syncope. Syncope was most often associated with bradyarrhythmic events, and palpitations have been associated only rarely with the presence of ventricular arrhythmia.34

Data on the use of ILR in early repolarization syndrome (ERS) are limited.30 Maury et al. reported the first ILR documentation of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation in a patient with syncope and ERS in the inferior leads.35 Use of an ILR is an option for the management of BrS or ERS patients with recurrent episodes of unexplained syncope who are at low risk of SCD.

Our findings confirm current data on the benefits of ILR for rhythmic risk stratification in selected AI syndrome patients, with a prospective, multicentre design and an extended follow-up period of up to 33 months.

The results of our study also are supported by current guidelines, which recommend ILR insertion for recurrent but infrequent, unexplained syncope or other intermittent symptoms suspicious for undocumented ventricular arrhythmia.19,36,37

Our study has several limitations. First, this study is observational, and it had no control group of matched patients without an ILR. Second, the overall sample size, follow-up duration, and event rate of our study were modest. Certain IA syndromes, such as BrS or ERS, are characterized by overall low event rates in the majority of patients. Thus, longer monitoring periods over 5-10 years would be required to establish more-robust data on the usefulness of ILR insertion in these specific patient populations. However, this approach would require multiple ILR replacements to be made in a single individual, resulting in significant logistic, ethical, financial, and regulatory hurdles.

Third, our study cohort was quite heterogeneous, including individuals with different IA syndromes. This aspect limits the predictive value of ILR use for each specific disorder, in addition to the overall low event rate and modest follow-up duration. Other limitations preventing the widespread use of ILR in patients with comparable phenotypes include the significant costs still associated with these devices. Clearly, large studies with longer follow-up periods, and ideally homogeneous, disease-specific cohorts of IA syndromes, are required to establish the definite role of ILR for the monitoring of subclinical high-risk features in these specific patient populations.

### Challenge of SCD prediction in IA syndromes

Risk stratification of SCD remains challenging for many IA syndromes, given the overall low event rates in many disorders, the atypical warning symptoms, and the fact that a large proportion of cardiac events occur in individuals at low or intermediate risk, who represent the bulk of patients.20 Moreover, cardiac arrest may be the presenting symptom for various primary electrical disorders, and a substantial proportion of cardiac events occur in individuals with apparently low- to moderate-risk phenotypes.1, 2, 3, 4

Despite major advances in the understanding and management of IA syndromes, significant knowledge gaps and uncertainties remain, resulting in a large gray zone of clinical risk prediction. For these situations, the indication for ICD insertion may be influenced largely by individual interpretation rather than scientific evidence.

### Conclusion

Implantable cardiac monitors are useful for ambulatory rhythm monitoring and may serve as a complementary diagnostic tool for the longitudinal follow-up of IA syndromes. Implantable cardiac monitors permit the detection of subclinical high-risk features and may be useful in identifying IA patients who may benefit from preventive ICD insertion beyond that performed for conventional indications.
