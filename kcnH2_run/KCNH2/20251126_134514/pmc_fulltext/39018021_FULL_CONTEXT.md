## Beneficial normalization of cardiac repolarization by carnitine in transgenic short QT syndrome type 1 rabbit models

### Abstract

AbstractAimsShort QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1) is a genetic channelopathy caused by gain-of-function variants in human-ether-a-go-go (HERG) underlying the rapid delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), leading to QT-shortening, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Data on efficient pharmacotherapy for SQT1 are scarce. In patients with primary carnitine-deficiency, acquired-short QT syndrome (SQTS) has been observed and rescued by carnitine supplementation. Here, we assessed whether carnitine exerts direct beneficial (prolonging) effects on cardiac repolarization in genetic SQTS.Methods and resultsAdult wild-type (WT) and transgenic SQT1 rabbits (HERG-N588K, gain of IKr) were used. In vivo electrocardiograms (ECGs), ex vivo monophasic action potentials (APs) in Langendorff-perfused hearts, and cellular ventricular APs and ion currents were assessed at baseline and during L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-perfusion. Two-dimensional computer simulations were performed to assess re-entry-based ventricular tachycardia-inducibility. L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolonged QT-intervals in WT and SQT1, leading to QT-normalization in SQT1. Similarly, monophasic and cellular AP duration (APD) was prolonged by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1. As underlying mechanisms, we identified acute effects on the main repolarizing ion currents: IKr-steady, which is pathologically increased in SQT1, was reduced by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine and deactivation kinetics were accelerated. Moreover, L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine decreased IKs-steady and IK1. In silico modelling identified IKr changes as the main factor for L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-induced APD-prolongation. 2D simulations revealed increased sustained re-entry-based arrhythmia formation in SQT1 compared to WT, which was decreased to the WT-level when adding carnitine-induced ion current changes.ConclusionL-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolong/normalize QT and whole-heart/cellular APD in SQT1 rabbits. These beneficial effects are mediated by acute effects on IKr. L-Carnitine may serve as a potential future QT-normalizing, anti-arrhythmic therapy in SQT1.

### Introduction

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a genetic cardiac channelopathy1 with a high risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD).2 To date, eight subtypes have been described.3 In the most frequent subtype, short QT syndrome type 1 (SQT1), gain-of-function mutations in KCNH2/HERG (N588K) lead to an increased rapid delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr) and a consecutive shortening of action potential (AP) duration (APD) and QT-duration.4

Current therapeutic strategies for SQTS patients are limited.5 An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended to prevent SCD6—especially after survived cardiac arrest—as there is a high risk of recurrence.5 As pharmacological therapy, (hydro)quinidine has the best evidence to prolong QT and reduce arrhythmia burden7,8—but it carries a high risk for gastrointestinal side effects that may decrease a patient’s compliance. In addition, a study has shown that quinidine might not be effective in all SQTS-variants, highlighting a possible variant-specific effect.9 Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel, efficient therapies in SQTS.

Primary carnitine-deficiency (PCD) is a genetic metabolic disorder, in which mutations in the carnitine-transporter OCTN2 cause a depletion of carnitine and carnitine long-chain fatty acids in the body.10 The most important biological function of carnitine is the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation, a process which results in the esterification of L-Carnitine to form long-chain acylcarnitine derivatives, such as the C16-Carnitines.11 The depletion of carnitine leads to impaired β-oxidation, and patients present with hypoglycaemia, steatosis, skeletal myopathy, and/or cardiomyopathy.

Recent studies have provided an additional link between PCD and (acquired) SQTS. Roussel et al.12 reported three PCD patients with associated symptomatic SQTS. A mouse model confirmed the relationship between low plasma levels of carnitine and QT-shortening.12 Similarly, Gélinas et al.13 described a case of a young woman dying unexpectedly during sleep, in which post-mortem genetic testing revealed a homozygous SLC22A5 mutation leading to the diagnosis of PCD. Her brother was subsequently diagnosed with PCD and acquired SQTS after genetic testing.13 In both publications, known SQTS-causing mutations were excluded, and carnitine supplementation normalized the previously shortened QT-interval, indicating that carnitine deficiency may cause acquired SQTS.

As such, carnitine supplementation may similarly prolong QT-intervals in healthy subjects and inherited SQTS, providing a novel ‘metabolic’ treatment approach. Indeed, indirect evidence that carnitine may prolong QT stems from various studies on the role of energy drinks—which, in addition to caffeine, contain a substantial amount of carnitine—for cardiac arrhythmogenic events such as atrial fibrillation, VF, or cardiac arrest.14,15 After the consumption of energy drinks, longer QTc was observed as compared to simple caffeine consumption.16

The mechanisms underlying QT-prolonging effects of carnitine, however, are not well studied and no systematic assessment of carnitine on cardiac ion currents and its potential use for QT-normalization in SQTS has been performed to date. To investigate the effects of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in SQT1, we used our recently established SQT1 rabbit model.17 In contrast to the mouse heart, which differs in various aspects from the human heart—mainly in the AP shape18 and in the underlying repolarizing ion currents18,19—the rabbit heart bears close resemblance to the human heart.19 Our SQT1 rabbit model, which expresses the N588K gain-of-function mutation in KCNH2/HERG leading to an impaired inactivation of IKr and therefore an increased IKr-steady current, mimics the human disease phenotype with shortened QT, shortened APD, and an increase in VT/VF incidence and SCD.17

### Methods

A more detailed method section can be found in the Supplementary material online.

All animal experiments were performed in compliance with EU legislation (directive 2010/63/EU) and the German animal welfare laws (TierSchG and TierSchVersV), after approval by the animal welfare committee of the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Freiburg; approval number G17/57). All experiments were performed in female and male adult rabbits (aged 4–7 months for all experiments).

For in vivo experiments (ECG), rabbits were anaesthetised with ketamine (Ketanest S® 25 mg/mL, Pfizer, Berlin, Germany) and xylazine (Rompun® 2%, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) (12.5/3.75 mg/kg intramuscularly, followed by intravenous (IV) infusion). Beating hearts excision [for monophasic AP (MAP) recordings and patch-clamping] was performed in ketamine/xylazine anaesthetised rabbits after additional injection of 500 IU heparine (Heparin sodium, 25,000 IU/mL, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) and euthanasia with 40 mg/kg thiopental sodium (Thiopental sodium 0.5 g, Inresa, Freiburg, Germany) IV.

Palmitoyl-L-Carnitine (C16-Carnitine) and L-Carnitine were purchased from Tocris and Sigma. Stock solutions (30 µM) were prepared in water and stored at −20°C until use.

Twelve lead surface ECGs were recorded in anaesthetised wild-type (WT) and SQT1 rabbits. ECGs were recorded at baseline and during perfusion with L-Carnitine (1 µmol/kg in total IV) or C16-Carnitine (0.1 µmol/kg in total IV) for up to 45 min, which results in L-Carnitine plasma levels of 16 µM in rabbits, as described in Roussel et al.12 C16-Carnitine plasma levels reached 1.67 µM, similar to concentrations in normal myocardium.20 Heart rate corrected QT index (QTi) was calculated (QTi = QTmeasured/QTexpected; QTexpected = 86 + 0.22*RR)17,21 at baseline and every 5 min after drug administration. In addition, QT-dispersion (QTmax – QTmin) and short-term variability of the QT (STVQT) were assessed.

Rapidly excised rabbit hearts were Langendorff-perfused via the aorta with a modified Krebs–Henseleit solution warmed to body temperature. A balloon-tipped catheter was placed into the left ventricle (LV). Hearts were paced at a constant rate of 2 Hz and MAP was recorded at baseline and during perfusion with L-Carnitine (4 or 40 µM) or C16-Carnitine (3 µM) by four epicardial electrodes. MAP durations at 75% of repolarisation were measured using the ISOHEART Data Acquisition software.

Ventricular myocytes from the LV wall were obtained from the hearts of WT or SQT1 rabbits by standard collagenase digestion.17 After euthanasia, hearts were rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold Tyrode solution, mounted on a Langendorff apparatus, and perfused with Ca2+-free solution supplemented with 0.8–1 mg/mL collagenase (Worthington Type 2) and 33 µmol/L (µM) Ca2+ for 25–40 min. All perfusates were gassed with 100% O2 and maintained at 37°C. At the end of the digestion, the LV was gently teased apart in Krafte-Brühe solution. Subsequently, the dissociated cells were filtered, washed, and centrifuged. The experiments were performed within 6–8 h of isolation. Only quiescent, rod-shaped myocytes with clear cross striations and no evidence of membrane blebbing were selected for patch-clamp studies.

Whole-cell currents and APs were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier, digitized at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz with Digidata 1440A interface, and acquired with pCLAMP software. APs were elicited by 5 ms stimulation pulses of ∼1.5–2 times higher magnitude than the threshold at 1 Hz stimulation frequency. APs were measured at steady state, defined as the last of a train of 15 beats at the same stimulation rate. All experiments were performed at room temperature. For studies of IKr, slow delayed-rectifier potassium current IKs, inward rectifier potassium current IK1, and transient-outward potassium current Ito, cardiomyocytes were superfused continuously at 1–2 mL/min with normal Tyrode. L-type calcium current (ICa, L), IKr, and IKs were inhibited by 1 µM nisoldipine, 5 µM E-4031, or 30 µM chromanol 293B, respectively.

All currents were recorded at baseline as well as during superfusion with 10 µM L-Carnitine or C16-Carnitine after at least 90 s of superfusion once stable conditions were reached.

To record IKs, cells were depolarized from the holding potential of −40 mV to +50 mV for 1.5 s in 10 mV increments. IK1 was recorded as Ba2+-sensitive current (2 mM BaCl2) from a holding potential of −20 mV by 500 ms voltage steps from −120 mV to +50 mV in 10 mV increments every 5 s.22 For Ito measurements, 300 µM CdCl2 was added to block ICa, L and to shift the I–V relationship of Ito and IKr to more positive potentials.21 Ito was elicited from a holding potential of −80 mV by 400 ms voltage steps from −20 mV to +60 mV in 10 mV increments every 3 s. Standard I–V curves of ICa, L were assessed with square voltage-clamp pulses (holding potential, VH = –40 mV, 400 ms steps from −30 mV to +30 mV). Subsequently, only the peak current at +20 mV was recorded before and after drug application.

Individual currents were normalized to the membrane capacitance to control for differences in cell size and expressed as current density (pA/pF). pClamp 10.2 and Origin 8.2 software were used for data acquisition and analysis.

The in silico KCNH2-p.(N588K) SQT1 and WT formulations of IKr from Loewe et al.23 were embedded in the O’Hara-Rudy human ventricular AP computational model24 to simulate WT and SQT1 conditions in the absence or presence of L-Carnitine treatment at the cellular and 2D tissue levels (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). The experimental voltage-clamp protocol and intra/extracellular K+ concentrations (120 and 5.4 mmol/L) were mimicked in silico, whereas the model temperature was set to 37°C. In addition, IKs was increased by 35% in the SQT1 model, as observed in SQT1 cardiomyocytes17 to mimic the experimental phenotype, while the experimentally observed effects of L-Carnitine on IKs were simulated as a 25% and 35% reduction in WT and SQT1, respectively (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1, Supplementary material online, Table S1). The effects of L-Carnitine on IK1 were similarly simulated by scaling down the inward-rectifying component of IK1 by 13% and 19% for SQT1 and WT, respectively based on experimentally observed effects (see Supplementary material online, Table S1).

The tissue simulations were performed using an S1S2 protocol applied to a homogenous piece of endocardial tissue of 9 × 9 cm (simulated with 600 × 600 cellular units) with an isotropic conduction velocity of ∼60 cm/s. In addition, an apicobasal gradient was incorporated by scaling the background K+ current (see Supplementary material online, Table S1) to phenotypically reproduce a ∼28 ms APD difference from apex to base, similar to Sung et al.25 The tissue was initialized with single-cell steady-state conditions obtained after 2000 s pre-pacing (1 Hz) followed by 10 s of tissue pre-pacing (1 Hz) with a planar wave from left to right. Subsequently, a stimulus (S1) was applied to generate a regular excitation wave and a second stimulus (S2) was applied to the upper-left quadrant of the tissue at varying coupling intervals. When the S2 stimulus is timed correctly, the tissue is sufficiently recovered from the S1 excitation to allow initiation of a new wave that may subsequently result in re-entry. All the simulations were performed through Myokit and Python.26 The model code, scripts, and data can be found online at: https://github.com/HeijmanLab

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation for in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Patch-clamp data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Normal distribution of all data was checked prior to statistical analyses. To analyse normally distributed data, Student’s t-tests were used: paired t-tests for comparison of parameters measured before vs. after drug administration and unpaired t-tests to compare genotypes. For not normally distributed data, non-parametric tests were used: Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparisons before and after treatment; Kruskal–Wallis test for genotype-specific comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, USA). P-values < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001 were considered statistically significant and were indicated as *, **, and ***; respectively.

All animal experiments were performed in compliance with EU legislation (directive 2010/63/EU) and the German animal welfare laws (TierSchG and TierSchVersV), after approval by the animal welfare committee of the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Freiburg; approval number G17/57).

### Compounds

Palmitoyl-L-Carnitine (C16-Carnitine) and L-Carnitine were purchased from Tocris and Sigma. Stock solutions (30 µM) were prepared in water and stored at −20°C until use.

### ECG

Twelve lead surface ECGs were recorded in anaesthetised wild-type (WT) and SQT1 rabbits.

In addition, QT-dispersion (QTmax – QTmin) and short-term variability of the QT (STVQT) were assessed.

### MAP measurements

Rapidly excised rabbit hearts were Langendorff-perfused via the aorta with a modified Krebs–Henseleit solution warmed to body temperature. A balloon-tipped catheter was placed into the left ventricle (LV). Hearts were paced at a constant rate of 2 Hz and MAP was recorded at baseline and during perfusion with L-Carnitine (4 or 40 µM) or C16-Carnitine (3 µM) by four epicardial electrodes. MAP durations at 75% of repolarisation were measured using the ISOHEART Data Acquisition software.

### Isolation of rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes

Ventricular myocytes from the LV wall were obtained from the hearts of WT or SQT1 rabbits by standard collagenase digestion.17 After euthanasia, hearts were rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold Tyrode solution, mounted on a Langendorff apparatus, and perfused with Ca2+-free solution supplemented with 0.8–1 mg/mL collagenase (Worthington Type 2) and 33 µmol/L (µM) Ca2+ for 25–40 min. All perfusates were gassed with 100% O2 and maintained at 37°C. At the end of the digestion, the LV was gently teased apart in Krafte-Brühe solution. Subsequently, the dissociated cells were filtered, washed, and centrifuged. The experiments were performed within 6–8 h of isolation.

### In silico modelling

The in silico KCNH2-p.(N588K) SQT1 and WT formulations of IKr from Loewe et al.23 were embedded in the O’Hara-Rudy human ventricular AP computational model24 to simulate WT and SQT1 conditions in the absence or presence of L-Carnitine treatment at the cellular and 2D tissue levels (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). The experimental voltage-clamp protocol and intra/extracellular K+ concentrations (120 and 5.4 mmol/L) were mimicked in silico, whereas the model temperature was set to 37°C.

### Results

SQT1 rabbits demonstrated shortened QT-interval duration (Figure 1), shortened APD (Figures 2 and 3), and increased IKr-steady current (Figure 4A) compared to WT, as previously described.17

(A and B) Representative recordings of IKr from WT (left panel) and SQT1 (right panel) at baseline (upper line) and after application of 10 μM L-Carnitine in the continued presence of Nisoldipine (Nis, to eliminate ICa,L) and Chromanol (Chro, to inhibit IKs) (lower line).

L-Carnitine prolonged the heart rate corrected QT-index (QTi) in both, WT and SQT1 (Figure 1A; Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

In WT rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed immediately (5 min) after L-Carnitine bolus (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2A), which lasted until the end of measurements. The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min was 5.2 ± 3.4%.

In SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of heart rate corrected QTi by L-Carnitine was also observed 5 min after carnitine application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2B). The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min (ΔQTi) was 5.7 ± 3.4% (Figure 1A). This effect lasted until the end of measurements.

At baseline, there was a significant difference in QTi with shortened QTi in SQT1 compared to WT (P < 0.01). These genotype differences persisted during carnitine perfusion as the extent of QTi-prolongation was similar in WT and SQT1 at both dosages. When comparing the QTi of SQT1 rabbits treated with L-Carnitine to baseline QTi in WT, however, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05; Supplementary material online, Figure S3A), indicating that carnitine may normalize QTi to WT-values observed in healthy animals.

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine treatment had any (potentially harmful) effects on regional QT-dispersion or temporal STVQT. No differences were observed in QT-dispersion and STVQT between WT and SQT1 at baseline, and importantly, in both genotypes, L-Carnitine had no effect on QT-dispersion and on STVQT (see Supplementary material online, Figure S5).

C16-Carnitine similarly prolonged the heart rate corrected QTi in WT and SQT1 rabbits (Figure 1B; Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

In WT and SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed starting at 5 min post-iv-bolus application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S4A). This effect lasted consistently for the duration of the measurements; the average prolongation (ΔQTi) 35 min post-bolus application was 4.1 ± 3.7% for WT and 3.6 ± 3.8% for SQT1 (Figure 1B).

Similar to Carnitine, genotype difference in QTi between SQT1 and WT persisted throughout the measurements with C16-Carnitine due to similar QTi-prolonging effects in both genotypes. When comparing the QTi in SQT1 rabbits treated with C16-Carnitine with WT rabbits at baseline, there was no significant difference in QTi (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3B), indicating a normalization of QTi of SQT1 animals treated with C16-Carnitine to WT-values.

In line with the QTi changes in vivo, L-Carnitine significantly prolonged MAP durations (APD75) in both WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts (Figure 2A) ex vivo. Two different dosages (4 and 40 µM) corresponding to low and high extremes of physiological plasma concentrations10 were assessed.

In WT rabbit hearts, the L-Carnitine-induced prolongation of APD75 was not significant for low dose (4 µM) but was significant for the high dose (40 µM) of L-Carnitine (P < 0.001; Figure 2A), resulting in a significant difference in the extent of ΔAPD between low and high dose of L-Carnitine (P < 0.05; Figure 2A).

By contrast, in SQT1 rabbits, the L-Carnitine-induced APD75-prolongation was already significant at low dose (4 µM) (P < 0.01; Figure 2A) and further increased at high dose (40 µM) (P < 0.05).

When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline, (WT: 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1: 124.3 ± 2.6 ms, P < 0.001) and in the presence of different L-Carnitine concentrations due to similar APD-prolonging effects of L-Carnitine in both genotypes. In contrast to the observations in vivo, APD75 in L-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter compared to WT baseline APD75 (WT baseline 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 4 µM 130.5 ± 3.5 ms, P < 0.05 vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 40 µM 134.2 ± 6.8 ms, P < 0.05).

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine had any effects on regional apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts during ex vivo MAP experiments. At baseline, there was no apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT, while SQT1 hearts showed a non-significant trend (P = 0.1) towards a slightly (+10 ms) longer APD in the LV base. Importantly, L-Carnitine did not induce any changes in the apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT or SQT1 hearts (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6).

The effect of C16-Carnitine on APD75  ex vivo was investigated at one concentration (3 µM), which is in the same range as previously investigated.20

C16-Carnitine significantly prolonged APD75 in WT (P < 0.001) and in SQT1 hearts (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline (WT 141.6 ± 9.1 ms vs. SQT1 123.9 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.01) and with C16-Carnitine (WT 148.8 ± 7.1 ms vs. SQT1 126.1 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.001). Accordingly, APD75 in C16-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter than WT APD75 at baseline (P < 0.05).

Consistent with our observations in whole-hearts, cellular APD was prolonged by L-Carnitine and by C16-Carnitine in isolated WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes (WT: L-Carnitine, + 10.4%, n = 11/7, P < 0.05; C16-Carnitine, + 23.6%, n = 17/7, P < 0.001; SQT1: L-Carnitine, + 9.5%, n = 16/7, P < 0.01; C16-Carnitine, + 10.0%, n = 19/5, P < 0.01; Figure 3A–C).

Similar to the ex vivo whole-heart APD data and hence in contrast to the observations in vivo, cellular APD90 in L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine-treated SQT1 cardiomyocytes remained shorter compared to WT baseline APD90.

Of note, in a small subset of SQT1 cardiomyocytes, C16-Carnitine effects were investigated at 1 Hz and 0.5 Hz (see Supplementary material online, Figure S7). In those cardiomyocytes, a more pronounced APD-prolonging effect was observed at slower stimulation rates, demonstrating a reverse rate-dependent modulation of APD90 with C16-Carnitine, which one would expect from drugs/metabolites that exert their effects via a blockade of IKr.

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed QT/APD-prolongation, the effects of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine on cardiac ion currents IKr, IKs, IK1, Ito, and ICa were measured in isolated WT and SQT1 rabbit cardiomyocytes. In all these experiments only one concentration was used for L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine (10 μM), which is within the physiological and previously tested concentration range.12,20

Carnitine/C16-Carnitine did not cause any changes in peak IKr-tail current densities in WT or SQT1 cardiomyocytes (Figure 4A–D). By contrast, IKr end-pulse/steady current, which is significantly increased in SQT1 and contributes to the accelerated repolarization in SQT1, was significantly reduced (−23%) by L-Carnitine (from 0.79 ± 0.07 to 0.61 ± 0.05 pA/pF) in WT and by −16% (from 1.25 ± 0.31 to 1.05 ± 0.27 pA/pF) in SQT1. Similar results were obtained to a lesser extent with C16-Carnitine in both genotypes (−8.3%/−9.3%) (Figure 4E and F) thereby contributing to APD-prolongation.

The voltage-dependent activation (characterized by the potential of half activation (V0.5) and the slope factor (dx) of IKr was not changed in either WT or in SQT1 following L-Carnitine administration (Figure 5A and B). C16-Carnitine (10 µM) produced a slight (3.9 mV) rightward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve of IKr-tail in WT but not in SQT1 (Figure 5A and B), indicating that IKr channels are slightly slower to activate in the presence of C16-Carnitine.

Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on IKr activation and deactivation. (A and B) Voltage-dependent activation curves in WT and SQT1 before and after application of L-Carnitine (A) and C16-Carnitine (B). To obtain the activation curves for IKr-tail currents, the amplitudes of the tail currents for various depolarizing step potentials (Vm) were normalized to the maximum tail current and plotted against Vm. The relationship between normalized IKr-tail current and Vm were fitted to a Boltzmann equation: g/gmax = 1/(1 + exp[(V0.5 − Vm)/k]), where V0.5 is the half-maximum activation voltage and k is the slope factor of the steady-state activation curve. (C and D). Deactivation of the IKr-tail currents in WT and SQT1 rabbits were analysed in the absence and presence of 10 µM L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine, respectively. The current decay of IKr-tail was fitted to a single exponential to obtain deactivation time constants tau, which are indicated as dot plots. Both compounds accelerated deactivation kinetics. Indicated are numbers of cardiomyocytes (n) and numbers of rabbits, from which the cardiomyocytes are isolated (N). Paired t-tests for baseline vs. Carnitine or C16-Carnitine, P-values are indicated.

In addition, both, L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine accelerated the deactivation kinetics of IKr-tail (Figure 5C and D; Supplementary material online, Figure S8). The most pronounced effect on the deactivation time constant was observed in SQT1 rabbits (SQT1, 631.0 ± 51.9 ms vs. 427.6 ± 57.3 ms). Qualitatively similar results were obtained in presence of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in both the WT and the SQT1 groups.

IKs end-pulse/steady current was significantly decreased by L-Carnitine in SQT1 and WT cardiomyocytes—in the voltage range from +20 to +40/50 mV (Figure 6A and C), thereby also contributing to the observed carnitine-induced APD-prolongation. This effect was also seen with C16-Carnitine at +40–50 mV in WT (Figure 6B and D) but did not reach statistical significance in SQT1.

Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on IKs. (A and B) Representative current recordings demonstrate the effect of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine on IKs in WT and SQT1 ventricular cardiomyocytes, pre-treated with E4031 and Nisoldipine to block IKr and ICa,L, respectively. (C and D) Voltage-dependent IKs end-pulse current density in WT (C) and SQT1 (D) rabbits. (E and F) I–V curves for IKs tail current density in WT (E) and SQT1 (F) ventricular cardiomyocytes. Indicated are numbers of cardiomyocytes (n) and numbers of rabbits, from which the cardiomyocytes are isolated (N). Paired t-tests for baseline vs. Carnitine or C16-Carnitine, P-values are indicated.

By contrast, IKs tail currents were only decreased significantly in SQT1 cardiomyocytes in the presence of L-Carnitine or C16-Carnitine (Figure 6E).

L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine did not cause any changes in Ito in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes (see Supplementary material online, Figure S9). Similarly, ICa,L was not altered by L-Carnitine or C16-Carnitine (see Supplementary material online, Figure S10).

Both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine decreased the inward component of IK1 in WT and SQT1 rabbits (WT, −17%, and SQT1, −13.8%, Supplementary material online, Figure S11) at very negative voltages of −120 mV. Interestingly, C16-Carnitine also significantly decreased the outward component of IK1 in the voltage range between −60 and 0 mV in WT (see Supplementary material online, Figure  S11) and may thereby contribute to the prolongation of APD in WT cardiomyocytes.

The computational model was able to reproduce the effects of L-Carnitine on IKr in WT and SQT1 (Figure 7A), with a significant reduction in both, IKr-steady and tail currents from −10 to +30 mV (Figure 7A). Consistent with cellular (Figure 3) and ex vivo monophasic APs (Figure 2), the model showed that L-Carnitine prolonged APD90 in SQT1 (Figure 7B). A sensitivity analysis of the effects of L-Carnitine, selectively excluding the effects on IKr, IKs, or IK1 in separate simulations, showed that the inhibition of IKr was primarily responsible for the APD-prolongation in SQT1 (see Supplementary material online, Figure S12).

In silico analysis of the anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine in SQT1. (A) IKr-steady and tail currents in WT and SQT1 model versions together with the fitted effects of the L-Carnitine treatment shown as average reduction in IKr-steady and IKr-tail in experiments (grey bars with dots representing individual cardiomyocytes) and model (light grey bars). (B) SQT1 and L-Carnitine effects on AP repolarization in a simulated human endocardial ventricular cardiomyocyte during 1 Hz pacing (left), together with the changes in IKr (right). (C) Re-entry sensitivity analysis was performed in a 2D homogenous 9 × 9 cm endocardial tissue through a S1S2 protocol. Sustained re-entries (> 9000 ms) could be induced for the untreated SQT1 phenotype (S1S2 interval of 240–290 ms), but not for the WT and SQT1 with L-Carnitine treatment groups (see exemplary simulations for WT, SQT1, and SQT1 + L-Carnitine in upper panel of C). The sum (Σ) of re-entry durations for all S1S2 intervals shows an ∼10-fold increase in total arrhythmogenic risk for the SQT1 phenotype compared to the WT and the SQT1 with L-Carnitine phenotypes (bottom right panel). No statistical comparisons were performed for the modelling data given the deterministic nature of the model, resulting in zero variation if simulations are repeated under the same conditions.

Moreover, the 2D tissue simulations revealed that sustained re-entry (i.e. re-entrant electrical activation lasting for > 9000 ms) can be induced in the SQT1 phenotype for an S1S2 interval of 240–290 ms; but cannot be induced in WT tissue (Figure 7C). Similar results were obtained in the absence of an apicobasal gradient (not shown). Strikingly, simulated L-Carnitine application prevented sustained re-entry formation in SQT1 (Figure 7C). Finally, the total arrhythmogenic risk was quantified by summing the re-entry duration over all the S1S2 intervals for each phenotype, which was approximately 10 times larger for untreated SQT1 than for WT and SQT1 with L-Carnitine treatment, with virtually no difference between the latter two.

### Baseline differences between WT and SQT1 rabbits

SQT1 rabbits demonstrated shortened QT-interval duration (Figure 1), shortened APD (Figures 2 and 3), and increased IKr-steady current (Figure 4A) compared to WT, as previously described.17

(A and B) Representative recordings of IKr from WT (left panel) and SQT1 (right panel) at baseline (upper line) and after application of 10 μM L-Carnitine in the continued presence of Nisoldipine (Nis, to eliminate ICa,L) and Chromanol (Chro, to inhibit IKs) (lower line). Voltage protocol indicated in inset. (C and D). Current density–voltage (I–V) relationships for WT and SQT1 at baseline and after L-Carnitine (C) as well as after C16-Carnitine (D) were obtained by plotting the tail current peak amplitude measured at −40 mV as a function of the respective test pulse potential preceding repolarization. Current amplitude corrected for cell capacitance observed in the absence and presence of drugs was plotted against the test potentials. (E and F).

### Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on ECG in vivo

L-Carnitine prolonged the heart rate corrected QT-index (QTi) in both, WT and SQT1 (Figure 1A; Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

In WT rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed immediately (5 min) after L-Carnitine bolus (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2A), which lasted until the end of measurements. The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min was 5.2 ± 3.4%.

In SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of heart rate corrected QTi by L-Carnitine was also observed 5 min after carnitine application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2B). The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min (ΔQTi) was 5.7 ± 3.4% (Figure 1A). This effect lasted until the end of measurements.

At baseline, there was a significant difference in QTi with shortened QTi in SQT1 compared to WT (P < 0.01). These genotype differences persisted during carnitine perfusion as the extent of QTi-prolongation was similar in WT and SQT1 at both dosages. When comparing the QTi of SQT1 rabbits treated with L-Carnitine to baseline QTi in WT, however, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05; Supplementary material online, Figure S3A), indicating that carnitine may normalize QTi to WT-values observed in healthy animals.

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine treatment had any (potentially harmful) effects on regional QT-dispersion or temporal STVQT. No differences were observed in QT-dispersion and STVQT between WT and SQT1 at baseline, and importantly, in both genotypes, L-Carnitine had no effect on QT-dispersion and on STVQT (see Supplementary material online, Figure S5).

C16-Carnitine similarly prolonged the heart rate corrected QTi in WT and SQT1 rabbits (Figure 1B; Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

In WT and SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed starting at 5 min post-iv-bolus application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S4A). This effect lasted consistently for the duration of the measurements; the average prolongation (ΔQTi) 35 min post-bolus application was 4.1 ± 3.7% for WT and 3.6 ± 3.8% for SQT1 (Figure 1B).

Similar to Carnitine, genotype difference in QTi between SQT1 and WT persisted throughout the measurements with C16-Carnitine due to similar QTi-prolonging effects in both genotypes. When comparing the QTi in SQT1 rabbits treated with C16-Carnitine with WT rabbits at baseline, there was no significant difference in QTi (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3B), indicating a normalization of QTi of SQT1 animals treated with C16-Carnitine to WT-values.

### Carnitine

L-Carnitine prolonged the heart rate corrected QT-index (QTi) in both, WT and SQT1 (Figure 1A; Supplementary material online, Figure S2).

In WT rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed immediately (5 min) after L-Carnitine bolus (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2A), which lasted until the end of measurements. The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min was 5.2 ± 3.4%.

In SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of heart rate corrected QTi by L-Carnitine was also observed 5 min after carnitine application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S2B). The average prolongation of QTi at 35 min (ΔQTi) was 5.7 ± 3.4% (Figure 1A). This effect lasted until the end of measurements.

At baseline, there was a significant difference in QTi with shortened QTi in SQT1 compared to WT (P < 0.01). These genotype differences persisted during carnitine perfusion as the extent of QTi-prolongation was similar in WT and SQT1 at both dosages. When comparing the QTi of SQT1 rabbits treated with L-Carnitine to baseline QTi in WT, however, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05; Supplementary material online, Figure S3A), indicating that carnitine may normalize QTi to WT-values observed in healthy animals.

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine treatment had any (potentially harmful) effects on regional QT-dispersion or temporal STVQT. No differences were observed in QT-dispersion and STVQT between WT and SQT1 at baseline, and importantly, in both genotypes, L-Carnitine had no effect on QT-dispersion and on STVQT (see Supplementary material online, Figure S5).

### C16-Carnitine

C16-Carnitine similarly prolonged the heart rate corrected QTi in WT and SQT1 rabbits (Figure 1B; Supplementary material online, Figure S4).

In WT and SQT1 rabbits, a significant prolongation of QTi was observed starting at 5 min post-iv-bolus application (P < 0.01; Supplementary material online, Figure S4A). This effect lasted consistently for the duration of the measurements; the average prolongation (ΔQTi) 35 min post-bolus application was 4.1 ± 3.7% for WT and 3.6 ± 3.8% for SQT1 (Figure 1B).

Similar to Carnitine, genotype difference in QTi between SQT1 and WT persisted throughout the measurements with C16-Carnitine due to similar QTi-prolonging effects in both genotypes. When comparing the QTi in SQT1 rabbits treated with C16-Carnitine with WT rabbits at baseline, there was no significant difference in QTi (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3B), indicating a normalization of QTi of SQT1 animals treated with C16-Carnitine to WT-values.

### Effects of carnitine and C16-Carnitine on monophasic APs ex vivo

In line with the QTi changes in vivo, L-Carnitine significantly prolonged MAP durations (APD75) in both WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts (Figure 2A) ex vivo. Two different dosages (4 and 40 µM) corresponding to low and high extremes of physiological plasma concentrations10 were assessed.

In WT rabbit hearts, the L-Carnitine-induced prolongation of APD75 was not significant for low dose (4 µM) but was significant for the high dose (40 µM) of L-Carnitine (P < 0.001; Figure 2A), resulting in a significant difference in the extent of ΔAPD between low and high dose of L-Carnitine (P < 0.05; Figure 2A).

By contrast, in SQT1 rabbits, the L-Carnitine-induced APD75-prolongation was already significant at low dose (4 µM) (P < 0.01; Figure 2A) and further increased at high dose (40 µM) (P < 0.05).

When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline, (WT: 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1: 124.3 ± 2.6 ms, P < 0.001) and in the presence of different L-Carnitine concentrations due to similar APD-prolonging effects of L-Carnitine in both genotypes. In contrast to the observations in vivo, APD75 in L-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter compared to WT baseline APD75 (WT baseline 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 4 µM 130.5 ± 3.5 ms, P < 0.05 vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 40 µM 134.2 ± 6.8 ms, P < 0.05).

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine had any effects on regional apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts during ex vivo MAP experiments. At baseline, there was no apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT, while SQT1 hearts showed a non-significant trend (P = 0.1) towards a slightly (+10 ms) longer APD in the LV base. Importantly, L-Carnitine did not induce any changes in the apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT or SQT1 hearts (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6).

The effect of C16-Carnitine on APD75  ex vivo was investigated at one concentration (3 µM), which is in the same range as previously investigated.20

C16-Carnitine significantly prolonged APD75 in WT (P < 0.001) and in SQT1 hearts (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline (WT 141.6 ± 9.1 ms vs. SQT1 123.9 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.01) and with C16-Carnitine (WT 148.8 ± 7.1 ms vs. SQT1 126.1 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.001). Accordingly, APD75 in C16-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter than WT APD75 at baseline (P < 0.05).

### L-Carnitine

In line with the QTi changes in vivo, L-Carnitine significantly prolonged MAP durations (APD75) in both WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts (Figure 2A) ex vivo. Two different dosages (4 and 40 µM) corresponding to low and high extremes of physiological plasma concentrations10 were assessed.

In WT rabbit hearts, the L-Carnitine-induced prolongation of APD75 was not significant for low dose (4 µM) but was significant for the high dose (40 µM) of L-Carnitine (P < 0.001; Figure 2A), resulting in a significant difference in the extent of ΔAPD between low and high dose of L-Carnitine (P < 0.05; Figure 2A).

By contrast, in SQT1 rabbits, the L-Carnitine-induced APD75-prolongation was already significant at low dose (4 µM) (P < 0.01; Figure 2A) and further increased at high dose (40 µM) (P < 0.05).

When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline, (WT: 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1: 124.3 ± 2.6 ms, P < 0.001) and in the presence of different L-Carnitine concentrations due to similar APD-prolonging effects of L-Carnitine in both genotypes. In contrast to the observations in vivo, APD75 in L-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter compared to WT baseline APD75 (WT baseline 146.5 ± 9.8 ms vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 4 µM 130.5 ± 3.5 ms, P < 0.05 vs. SQT1 L-Carnitine 40 µM 134.2 ± 6.8 ms, P < 0.05).

We further investigated whether L-Carnitine had any effects on regional apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT and SQT1 rabbit hearts during ex vivo MAP experiments. At baseline, there was no apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT, while SQT1 hearts showed a non-significant trend (P = 0.1) towards a slightly (+10 ms) longer APD in the LV base. Importantly, L-Carnitine did not induce any changes in the apico-basal APD heterogeneity in WT or SQT1 hearts (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6).

### C16-Carnitine

The effect of C16-Carnitine on APD75  ex vivo was investigated at one concentration (3 µM), which is in the same range as previously investigated.20

C16-Carnitine significantly prolonged APD75 in WT (P < 0.001) and in SQT1 hearts (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). When comparing WT and SQT1 hearts, there were significant differences in APD75 both at baseline (WT 141.6 ± 9.1 ms vs. SQT1 123.9 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.01) and with C16-Carnitine (WT 148.8 ± 7.1 ms vs. SQT1 126.1 ± 10.0 ms, P < 0.001). Accordingly, APD75 in C16-Carnitine-treated SQT1 hearts remained shorter than WT APD75 at baseline (P < 0.05).

### L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on cellular APD

Consistent with our observations in whole-hearts, cellular APD was prolonged by L-Carnitine and by C16-Carnitine in isolated WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes (WT: L-Carnitine, + 10.4%, n = 11/7, P < 0.05; C16-Carnitine, + 23.6%, n = 17/7, P < 0.001; SQT1: L-Carnitine, + 9.5%, n = 16/7, P < 0.01; C16-Carnitine, + 10.0%, n = 19/5, P < 0.01; Figure 3A–C).

Similar to the ex vivo whole-heart APD data and hence in contrast to the observations in vivo, cellular APD90 in L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine-treated SQT1 cardiomyocytes remained shorter compared to WT baseline APD90.

Of note, in a small subset of SQT1 cardiomyocytes, C16-Carnitine effects were investigated at 1 Hz and 0.5 Hz (see Supplementary material online, Figure S7). In those cardiomyocytes, a more pronounced APD-prolonging effect was observed at slower stimulation rates, demonstrating a reverse rate-dependent modulation of APD90 with C16-Carnitine, which one would expect from drugs/metabolites that exert their effects via a blockade of IKr.

### L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on cardiac ion currents

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed QT/APD-prolongation, the effects of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine on cardiac ion currents IKr, IKs, IK1, Ito, and ICa were measured in isolated WT and SQT1 rabbit cardiomyocytes. In all these experiments only one concentration was used for L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine (10 μM), which is within the physiological and previously tested concentration range.12,20

### IKr currents

Carnitine/C16-Carnitine did not cause any changes in peak IKr-tail current densities in WT or SQT1 cardiomyocytes (Figure 4A–D). By contrast, IKr end-pulse/steady current, which is significantly increased in SQT1 and contributes to the accelerated repolarization in SQT1, was significantly reduced (−23%) by L-Carnitine (from 0.79 ± 0.07 to 0.61 ± 0.05 pA/pF) in WT and by −16% (from 1.25 ± 0.31 to 1.05 ± 0.27 pA/pF) in SQT1. Similar results were obtained to a lesser extent with C16-Carnitine in both genotypes (−8.3%/−9.3%) (Figure 4E and F) thereby contributing to APD-prolongation.

The voltage-dependent activation (characterized by the potential of half activation (V0.5) and the slope factor (dx) of IKr was not changed in either WT or in SQT1 following L-Carnitine administration (Figure 5A and B). C16-Carnitine (10 µM) produced a slight (3.9 mV) rightward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve of IKr-tail in WT but not in SQT1 (Figure 5A and B), indicating that IKr channels are slightly slower to activate in the presence of C16-Carnitine.

Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on IKr activation and deactivation. (A and B) Voltage-dependent activation curves in WT and SQT1 before and after application of L-Carnitine (A) and C16-Carnitine (B). To obtain the activation curves for IKr-tail currents, the amplitudes of the tail currents for various depolarizing step potentials (Vm) were normalized to the maximum tail current and plotted against Vm. The relationship between normalized IKr-tail current and Vm were fitted to a Boltzmann equation: g/gmax = 1/(1 + exp[(V0.5 − Vm)/k]), where V0.5 is the half-maximum activation voltage and k is the slope factor of the steady-state activation curve. (C and D). Deactivation of the IKr-tail currents in WT and SQT1 rabbits were analysed in the absence and presence of 10 µM L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine, respectively. The current decay of IKr-tail was fitted to a single exponential to obtain deactivation time constants tau, which are indicated as dot plots. Both compounds accelerated deactivation kinetics. Indicated are numbers of cardiomyocytes (n) and numbers of rabbits, from which the cardiomyocytes are isolated (N). Paired t-tests for baseline vs. Carnitine or C16-Carnitine, P-values are indicated.

In addition, both, L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine accelerated the deactivation kinetics of IKr-tail (Figure 5C and D; Supplementary material online, Figure S8). The most pronounced effect on the deactivation time constant was observed in SQT1 rabbits (SQT1, 631.0 ± 51.9 ms vs. 427.6 ± 57.3 ms). Qualitatively similar results were obtained in presence of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in both the WT and the SQT1 groups.

### IKs currents

IKs end-pulse/steady current was significantly decreased by L-Carnitine in SQT1 and WT cardiomyocytes—in the voltage range from +20 to +40/50 mV (Figure 6A and C), thereby also contributing to the observed carnitine-induced APD-prolongation. This effect was also seen with C16-Carnitine at +40–50 mV in WT (Figure 6B and D) but did not reach statistical significance in SQT1.

Indicated are numbers of cardiomyocytes (n) and numbers of rabbits, from which the cardiomyocytes are isolated (N).

By contrast, IKs tail currents were only decreased significantly in SQT1 cardiomyocytes in the presence of L-Carnitine or C16-Carnitine (Figure 6E).

### Ito currents and ICa,L currents

L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine did not cause any changes in Ito in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes (see Supplementary material online, Figure S9). Similarly, ICa,L was not altered by L-Carnitine or C16-Carnitine (see Supplementary material online, Figure S10).

Both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine decreased the inward component of IK1 in WT and SQT1 rabbits (WT, −17%, and SQT1, −13.8%, Supplementary material online, Figure S11) at very negative voltages of −120 mV. Interestingly, C16-Carnitine also significantly decreased the outward component of IK1 in the voltage range between −60 and 0 mV in WT (see Supplementary material online, Figure  S11) and may thereby contribute to the prolongation of APD in WT cardiomyocytes.

### IK1 currents

Both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine decreased the inward component of IK1 in WT and SQT1 rabbits (WT, −17%, and SQT1, −13.8%, Supplementary material online, Figure S11) at very negative voltages of −120 mV. Interestingly, C16-Carnitine also significantly decreased the outward component of IK1 in the voltage range between −60 and 0 mV in WT (see Supplementary material online, Figure  S11) and may thereby contribute to the prolongation of APD in WT cardiomyocytes.

### Anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine-induced ion current changes in SQT1 in 2D in silico models

The computational model was able to reproduce the effects of L-Carnitine on IKr in WT and SQT1 (Figure 7A), with a significant reduction in both, IKr-steady and tail currents from −10 to +30 mV (Figure 7A). Consistent with cellular (Figure 3) and ex vivo monophasic APs (Figure 2), the model showed that L-Carnitine prolonged APD90 in SQT1 (Figure 7B). A sensitivity analysis of the effects of L-Carnitine, selectively excluding the effects on IKr, IKs, or IK1 in separate simulations, showed that the inhibition of IKr was primarily responsible for the APD-prolongation in SQT1 (see Supplementary material online, Figure S12).

In silico analysis of the anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine in SQT1. (A) IKr-steady and tail currents in WT and SQT1 model versions together with the fitted effects of the L-Carnitine treatment shown as average reduction in IKr-steady and IKr-tail in experiments (grey bars with dots representing individual cardiomyocytes) and model (light grey bars). (B) SQT1 and L-Carnitine effects on AP repolarization in a simulated human endocardial ventricular cardiomyocyte during 1 Hz pacing (left), together with the changes in IKr (right). (C) Re-entry sensitivity analysis was performed in a 2D homogenous 9 × 9 cm endocardial tissue through a S1S2 protocol. Sustained re-entries (> 9000 ms) could be induced for the untreated SQT1 phenotype (S1S2 interval of 240–290 ms), but not for the WT and SQT1 with L-Carnitine treatment groups (see exemplary simulations for WT, SQT1, and SQT1 + L-Carnitine in upper panel of C). The sum (Σ) of re-entry durations for all S1S2 intervals shows an ∼10-fold increase in total arrhythmogenic risk for the SQT1 phenotype compared to the WT and the SQT1 with L-Carnitine phenotypes (bottom right panel). No statistical comparisons were performed for the modelling data given the deterministic nature of the model, resulting in zero variation if simulations are repeated under the same conditions.

Moreover, the 2D tissue simulations revealed that sustained re-entry (i.e. re-entrant electrical activation lasting for > 9000 ms) can be induced in the SQT1 phenotype for an S1S2 interval of 240–290 ms; but cannot be induced in WT tissue (Figure 7C). Similar results were obtained in the absence of an apicobasal gradient (not shown). Strikingly, simulated L-Carnitine application prevented sustained re-entry formation in SQT1 (Figure 7C). Finally, the total arrhythmogenic risk was quantified by summing the re-entry duration over all the S1S2 intervals for each phenotype, which was approximately 10 times larger for untreated SQT1 than for WT and SQT1 with L-Carnitine treatment, with virtually no difference between the latter two.

### Discussion

The observation of a connection between PCD—a metabolic disease leading to impaired mitochondrial β-oxidation—and acquired SQTS12,13 with a subsequent normalization of the electrical phenotype (QT-interval) after oral supplementation of carnitine, prompted us to investigate whether carnitine might also have direct—non-metabolic—cardiac electrophysiological effect(s) that could similarly normalize QT/APD in inherited SQTS, and, if so, which mechanisms might be involved.

As we have previously demonstrated other metabolites (such as propionic acid) may—in addition to their well-documented effects on cellular metabolism and oxidative stress—acutely modulate repolarizing ion current densities and their kinetics, thereby directly affecting cardiac repolarization and QT-duration,27 we similarly investigated (direct, acute) electrophysiological effects of L-Carnitine and its metabolite C16-Carnitine on cardiac repolarization in vivo, ex vivo on the whole-heart, and in vitro at the cellular/ion current levels.

We studied the effects of L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine in vivo in their physiological plasma concentration range,12,20 which is around 10–40 μM for L-Carnitine and around 1–10 µM for C16-Carnitine. WT and transgenic SQT1 rabbit models (HERG-N588 K) mimic the human SQTS disease phenotype on all levels due to impaired IKr inactivation and subsequent shortening of cellular and whole-heart APD and in vivo QT-duration.17 Here, we demonstrated a significant QT- and APD-prolonging effect of both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1. Notably, while baseline QT-interval on the surface ECG, as well as APD in whole-hearts and isolated cardiomyocytes were shorter in transgenic SQT1 rabbits compared to WT controls, there was no difference between the QTi of SQT1 rabbits treated with L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine and baseline QTi of WT rabbits, indicating a L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-induced normalization of QT in SQT1. Importantly, regional QT-dispersion and STVQT were not enhanced by L-Carnitine, indicating a safe and homogenous prolongation of cardiac repolarization. In the ex vivo APD measurements—both in Langendorff-perfused hearts and in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes—a significant APD-prolongation was similarly observed after perfusion with both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in SQT1 and WT. This, however, did not lead to a complete normalization of APD in SQT1 animals at the applied L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine concentrations in our experiments. These discrepancies between in vivo and ex vivo data might be partially due to the lack of autonomic control ex vivo, which removes sympathetic activation of IKs and hence the importance of IKs for cardiac repolarization. This might thereby reduce the contribution of L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-induced IKs-alterations to APD-prolongation compared to in vivo conditions.

The QT prolongation in surface ECGs could already be observed around 5 min after L-Carnitine injection, and APD-prolongation in patch-clamp recordings was already apparent after 90 s of perfusion, indicating an acute, direct effect of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine on cardiac ion channel properties. This acute and direct QT/APD-prolonging effect of L-Carnitine—and its mechanisms that will be detailed later—are novel results as the electrophysiological effects of this compound have not been studied before. Some data on the effects of C16-Carnitine and other long-chain acylcarnitines on cardiac ion currents and Ca2+ homeostasis, in contrast, have previously been published.20,28 These, however, investigated mostly pathophysiologically high concentration ranges, because their myocardial accumulation in certain diseased conditions—such as in heart failure or myocardial ischemia—have been related/linked to increased arrhythmogenesis and impaired cardiac pump function.29

We observed APD-prolonging effects on whole-heart and cellular APD by both, physiological L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine concentrations. While no other studies have investigated L-Carnitine effects on APD, the previously available data on C16-Carnitine effects on APD seem to be conflicting and dose-dependent. High doses of C16-Carnitine (30–75 µM) have been reported to shorten APD in guinea pig and rabbit papillary muscles.28,30 By contrast, at lower, more physiological doses (10 µM), a biphasic effect on APD (initial prolongation followed by shortening of APD) was observed in guinea pig cardiomyocytes,31 similar to our study in rabbit cardiomyocytes. This APD-prolonging effect of 10 µM C16-Carnitine was even more pronounced when applied after internal dialysis,32 and was attributed to an inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump current.33

To determine the potential mechanisms underlying the acute APD/QT-prolonging effects of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine, we investigated their (direct) electrophysiological effects on the main repolarizing potassium ion currents and the depolarizing ICa,L responsible for shaping the AP in healthy and SQT1 cardiomyocytes.

IKr end-pulse/steady current is significantly increased in SQT1 due to impaired inactivation and contributes to the accelerated repolarization in SQT1.17 IKr-steady was significantly reduced by L-Carnitine in WT and in SQT1 and to a lesser extent also by C16-Carnitine, thereby contributing to an APD-prolongation. In addition, both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine led to faster deactivation of IKr in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes. Finally, C16-Carnitine even caused a slight rightward shift in the steady-state activation curve of WT IKr. A similar change in activation/deactivation kinetics has been previously described for the long QT syndrome-causing variant KCNH2-R56Q, in which accelerated deactivation kinetics resulted in a rightward shift in the voltage-dependent steady-state activation curve with slower IKr activation and subsequent prolongation of repolarization.34 Thus, the observed changes in IKr induced by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine likely contribute to the observed APD-prolongation in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes.

Interestingly, Ferro et al.20 also reported accelerated deactivation kinetics induced by long-chain-acyl carnitines in recombinant HEK-293 cells. The general effect on IKr, however, contrasted with our findings as they reported that C16- and C18-Carnitine induced a dose-dependent increase in IKr—(both end-pulse and tail current) while L-Carnitine did not affect IKr in their mammalian expression system.20 One possible explanation may be different properties and drug-susceptibilities of native HERG channels in cardiomyocytes vs. cloned channels overexpressed in heterologous expression systems. This can be due to the presence of native subunits and other intracellular modulators in cardiomyocytes as described by Sanguinetti et al.35

IKs end-pulse/steady current was also decreased (particularly at more positive potentials) by L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes, which is expected to partially reduce its function as a repolarization reserve current and may also contribute to the overall APD-prolongation we observed.

L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine had no effect on Ito in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes. This is in agreement with previous reports on the effects of extracellular and intracellular L-Carnitine application.32,36 C16-Carnitine, however, reduced Ito currents in that study, but only when it was dialyzed in rat ventricular myocytes.32 This observation might play a role in long-term drug effects under pathological conditions, in which C16-Carnitine may accumulate in the sarcolemma.

In WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes, IK1, which plays an important role in stabilizing the diastolic membrane potential and shaping phase 3 of the cardiac AP was slightly but significantly decreased in the presence of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine both in WT and SQT1 at voltage ranges between −120 and −100 mV (inward component). This is in line with the findings of Sato et al.37 showing that C16-Carnitine inhibits IK1 in guinea pig cardiomyocytes and thereby can slightly depolarize resting membrane potential—an effect that we did, however, not observe in our study.

An in silico sensitivity analysis of the effects of L-Carnitine, selectively excluding the effects on IKr, IKs, or IK1 in separate simulations, supports the notion that inhibition of IKr is primarily responsible for the L-Carnitine-induced APD-prolongation in SQT1.

In sum, we identified an acute reduction of IKr-steady, which is pathologically increased in SQT1, and an accelerated IKr deactivation as main mechanisms accounting for the L-Carnitine-induced APD/QT-normalization in SQT1.

In this study, we focused on investigating carnitine’s (acute) impact on repolarizing K+ currents, as major drivers of the AP duration. Due to carnitine’s effects on the membrane lipid composition, which can also affect the expression and function of cardiac ion channels,38 a more comprehensive assessment of both acute and chronic effects, including the modulation of Na+ currents, would be required to fully elucidate the impact of carnitine on cardiac electrophysiology.

These experimentally observed ionic changes were incorporated into WT and SQT1 in silico models to investigate the potential anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine. Multi-scale in silico analyses of the acute effects of L-Carnitine on human ventricular electrophysiology confirmed (i) the increased pro-arrhythmic propensity in SQT1 2D tissues due to facilitated re-entry formation based on the shortened APD and abbreviated refractory periods, which allow for the formation of full, sustained re-entry, and (ii) the anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine in SQT1: While in SQT1 2D tissues, sustained re-entry could be induced readily at S1S2 intervals of 240–290 ms, the incorporation of L-Carnitine-induced changes in IKr (IKs and IK1) into the 2D model prevented the inducibility of sustained re-entry due to its APD-prolonging/normalizing effect, which prevented formation of re-entry due to longer tissue refractoriness, resulting in insufficient excitable tissue for re-entry formation. In addition, this wavelength prolongation relative to tissue size would be expected to reduce re-entry stability in line with the ‘critical mass theory’,39,40 further supporting an anti-arrhythmic effect of L-Carnitine in genetic SQTS. While anti-arrhythmic mechanisms may be slightly different in 3D, data from Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs have shown that prolongation of repolarization duration (in the absence of early afterdepolarizations has similar anti-arrhythmic effects in vivo.41

To date, therapeutic strategies in the rare inherited channelopathy SQTS are limited. ICD implantation is recommended, particularly in symptomatic patients,6 but only treats the arrhythmias once they occur and may be associated with complications such as inappropriate ICD shocks due to T-wave oversensing, electrode dysfunction, electrode dislocation, or infection. Due to the young age of patients, non-surgical alternative treatment options are warranted. (Hydro)quinidine has been demonstrated to be effective in prolonging QT and reducing arrhythmia burden; but carries pronounced gastrointestinal side effects.42

Carnitine might be a good addition to the treatment of SQTS as it has been demonstrated that carnitine supplementation may normalize the pathologically shortened QT-interval in patients with PCD (and concomitant acquired SQTS).12,13 Here, we expand these data to genetic SQTS in the absence of intrinsic carnitine-deficiency, demonstrating a prolongation of cardiac repolarization in SQTS without the induction of any (potentially pro-arrhythmic) regional or temporal heterogeneity in cardiac repolarization, further underlining its suitability for therapeutic QT/APD-prolongation in SQTS. Further studies with SQTS patients are required to investigate whether similar QT-normalization effects can be observed in human SQTS patients. Importantly, in our study, we applied carnitine intravenously; but for long-term treatment of human SQTS patients, oral applications would be desirable—as already applied in PCD patients.12,13 Thus, optimal oral carnitine dosages and long-term (beneficial and potentially harmful) effects need to be investigated in SQTS patients. This is particularly important as carnitine may also affect the membrane lipid composition—particularly in the context of pathologically high carnitine and acylcarnitine concentrations38—which may modulate cardiac electrophysiology and thus needs to be considered when assessing the suitable therapeutic carnitine dosage in SQTS. Last but not least, these studies need to be complemented by long-term assessment of anti-arrhythmic effects in patients to confirm the beneficial reduction of re-entry-based arrhythmias that we observed in our in silico modelling.

Available therapeutic strategies (ICD and/or quinidine) in SQTS are limited, not effective in each SQTS patient and carry side effects. Carnitine might be an alternative pharmacological therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that carnitine can normalize QT/APD in transgenic SQT1 rabbits. These beneficial effects are mediated by alterations in IKr-steady and IKr deactivation kinetics. 2D computer simulations indicate anti-arrhythmic effects of these ionic changes. We expect similar effects in SQT1 patients, warranting confirmatory studies on beneficial QT-normalizing/anti-arrhythmic effects of carnitine in SQTS patients. As carnitine is well-tolerated and commonly used in primary carnitine-deficiency and food supplements, it could be readily used clinically.

### Effects of L-Carnitine and C-16-Carnitine on QT/APD

We studied the effects of L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine in vivo in their physiological plasma concentration range,12,20 which is around 10–40 μM for L-Carnitine and around 1–10 µM for C16-Carnitine.

### L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine effects on cellular APD

We observed APD-prolonging effects on whole-heart and cellular APD by both, physiological L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine concentrations. While no other studies have investigated L-Carnitine effects on APD, the previously available data on C16-Carnitine effects on APD seem to be conflicting and dose-dependent. High doses of C16-Carnitine (30–75 µM) have been reported to shorten APD in guinea pig and rabbit papillary muscles.28,30 By contrast, at lower, more physiological doses (10 µM), a biphasic effect on APD (initial prolongation followed by shortening of APD) was observed in guinea pig cardiomyocytes,31 similar to our study in rabbit cardiomyocytes. This APD-prolonging effect of 10 µM C16-Carnitine was even more pronounced when applied after internal dialysis,32 and was attributed to an inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump current.33

### Ionic mechanism of APD-prolongation

To determine the potential mechanisms underlying the acute APD/QT-prolonging effects of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine, we investigated their (direct) electrophysiological effects on the main repolarizing potassium ion currents and the depolarizing ICa,L responsible for shaping the AP in healthy and SQT1 cardiomyocytes.

IKr end-pulse/steady current is significantly increased in SQT1 due to impaired inactivation and contributes to the accelerated repolarization in SQT1.17 IKr-steady was significantly reduced by L-Carnitine in WT and in SQT1 and to a lesser extent also by C16-Carnitine, thereby contributing to an APD-prolongation. In addition, both L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine led to faster deactivation of IKr in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes. Finally, C16-Carnitine even caused a slight rightward shift in the steady-state activation curve of WT IKr. A similar change in activation/deactivation kinetics has been previously described for the long QT syndrome-causing variant KCNH2-R56Q, in which accelerated deactivation kinetics resulted in a rightward shift in the voltage-dependent steady-state activation curve with slower IKr activation and subsequent prolongation of repolarization.34 Thus, the observed changes in IKr induced by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine likely contribute to the observed APD-prolongation in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes.

Interestingly, Ferro et al.20 also reported accelerated deactivation kinetics induced by long-chain-acyl carnitines in recombinant HEK-293 cells. The general effect on IKr, however, contrasted with our findings as they reported that C16- and C18-Carnitine induced a dose-dependent increase in IKr—(both end-pulse and tail current) while L-Carnitine did not affect IKr in their mammalian expression system.20 One possible explanation may be different properties and drug-susceptibilities of native HERG channels in cardiomyocytes vs. cloned channels overexpressed in heterologous expression systems. This can be due to the presence of native subunits and other intracellular modulators in cardiomyocytes as described by Sanguinetti et al.35

IKs end-pulse/steady current was also decreased (particularly at more positive potentials) by L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes, which is expected to partially reduce its function as a repolarization reserve current and may also contribute to the overall APD-prolongation we observed.

L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine had no effect on Ito in WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes. This is in agreement with previous reports on the effects of extracellular and intracellular L-Carnitine application.32,36 C16-Carnitine, however, reduced Ito currents in that study, but only when it was dialyzed in rat ventricular myocytes.32 This observation might play a role in long-term drug effects under pathological conditions, in which C16-Carnitine may accumulate in the sarcolemma.

In WT and SQT1 cardiomyocytes, IK1, which plays an important role in stabilizing the diastolic membrane potential and shaping phase 3 of the cardiac AP was slightly but significantly decreased in the presence of L-Carnitine and C16-Carnitine both in WT and SQT1 at voltage ranges between −120 and −100 mV (inward component). This is in line with the findings of Sato et al.37 showing that C16-Carnitine inhibits IK1 in guinea pig cardiomyocytes and thereby can slightly depolarize resting membrane potential—an effect that we did, however, not observe in our study.

An in silico sensitivity analysis of the effects of L-Carnitine, selectively excluding the effects on IKr, IKs, or IK1 in separate simulations, supports the notion that inhibition of IKr is primarily responsible for the L-Carnitine-induced APD-prolongation in SQT1.

In sum, we identified an acute reduction of IKr-steady, which is pathologically increased in SQT1, and an accelerated IKr deactivation as main mechanisms accounting for the L-Carnitine-induced APD/QT-normalization in SQT1.

In this study, we focused on investigating carnitine’s (acute) impact on repolarizing K+ currents, as major drivers of the AP duration. Due to carnitine’s effects on the membrane lipid composition, which can also affect the expression and function of cardiac ion channels,38 a more comprehensive assessment of both acute and chronic effects, including the modulation of Na+ currents, would be required to fully elucidate the impact of carnitine on cardiac electrophysiology.

### Anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine in SQTS

These experimentally observed ionic changes were incorporated into WT and SQT1 in silico models to investigate the potential anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine. Multi-scale in silico analyses of the acute effects of L-Carnitine on human ventricular electrophysiology confirmed (i) the increased pro-arrhythmic propensity in SQT1 2D tissues due to facilitated re-entry formation based on the shortened APD and abbreviated refractory periods, which allow for the formation of full, sustained re-entry, and (ii) the anti-arrhythmic effects of L-Carnitine in SQT1: While in SQT1 2D tissues, sustained re-entry could be induced readily at S1S2 intervals of 240–290 ms, the incorporation of L-Carnitine-induced changes in IKr (IKs and IK1) into the 2D model prevented the inducibility of sustained re-entry due to its APD-prolonging/normalizing effect, which prevented formation of re-entry due to longer tissue refractoriness, resulting in insufficient excitable tissue for re-entry formation. In addition, this wavelength prolongation relative to tissue size would be expected to reduce re-entry stability in line with the ‘critical mass theory’,39,40 further supporting an anti-arrhythmic effect of L-Carnitine in genetic SQTS. While anti-arrhythmic mechanisms may be slightly different in 3D, data from Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs have shown that prolongation of repolarization duration (in the absence of early afterdepolarizations has similar anti-arrhythmic effects in vivo.41

### Clinical implications

To date, therapeutic strategies in the rare inherited channelopathy SQTS are limited. ICD implantation is recommended, particularly in symptomatic patients,6 but only treats the arrhythmias once they occur and may be associated with complications such as inappropriate ICD shocks due to T-wave oversensing, electrode dysfunction, electrode dislocation, or infection. Due to the young age of patients, non-surgical alternative treatment options are warranted. (Hydro)quinidine has been demonstrated to be effective in prolonging QT and reducing arrhythmia burden; but carries pronounced gastrointestinal side effects.42

Carnitine might be a good addition to the treatment of SQTS as it has been demonstrated that carnitine supplementation may normalize the pathologically shortened QT-interval in patients with PCD (and concomitant acquired SQTS).12,13 Here, we expand these data to genetic SQTS in the absence of intrinsic carnitine-deficiency, demonstrating a prolongation of cardiac repolarization in SQTS without the induction of any (potentially pro-arrhythmic) regional or temporal heterogeneity in cardiac repolarization, further underlining its suitability for therapeutic QT/APD-prolongation in SQTS. Further studies with SQTS patients are required to investigate whether similar QT-normalization effects can be observed in human SQTS patients. Importantly, in our study, we applied carnitine intravenously; but for long-term treatment of human SQTS patients, oral applications would be desirable—as already applied in PCD patients.12,13 Thus, optimal oral carnitine dosages and long-term (beneficial and potentially harmful) effects need to be investigated in SQTS patients. This is particularly important as carnitine may also affect the membrane lipid composition—particularly in the context of pathologically high carnitine and acylcarnitine concentrations38—which may modulate cardiac electrophysiology and thus needs to be considered when assessing the suitable therapeutic carnitine dosage in SQTS. Last but not least, these studies need to be complemented by long-term assessment of anti-arrhythmic effects in patients to confirm the beneficial reduction of re-entry-based arrhythmias that we observed in our in silico modelling.

Available therapeutic strategies (ICD and/or quinidine) in SQTS are limited, not effective in each SQTS patient and carry side effects. Carnitine might be an alternative pharmacological therapy. In this study, we demonstrate that carnitine can normalize QT/APD in transgenic SQT1 rabbits. These beneficial effects are mediated by alterations in IKr-steady and IKr deactivation kinetics. 2D computer simulations indicate anti-arrhythmic effects of these ionic changes. We expect similar effects in SQT1 patients, warranting confirmatory studies on beneficial QT-normalizing/anti-arrhythmic effects of carnitine in SQTS patients. As carnitine is well-tolerated and commonly used in primary carnitine-deficiency and food supplements, it could be readily used clinically.
