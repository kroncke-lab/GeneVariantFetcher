## Exploiting ion channel structure to assess rare variant pathogenicity

### Abstract

BackgroundA 27-year-old female was seen for long QT syndrome. She was found to be a carrier of two variants, KCNQ1 Val162Met and KCNH2 Ser55Leu, and both were annotated as pathogenic by a diagnostic laboratory in part because of sequence proximity to other known pathogenic variants.ObjectiveTo assess the relationship between both the KCNQ1 and KCNH2 variants and clinical significance using protein structure, in vitro functional assays, and familial segregation.MethodsWe used co-segregation analysis of family, patch clamp in vitro electrophysiology, and structural analysis using recently released cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of both channels.ResultsThe structural analysis indicates that KCNQ1 Val162Met is oriented away from functionally important regions, while Ser55Leu is positioned at domains critical for KCNH2 fast inactivation. Clinical phenotyping and electrophysiologic study further support the conclusion that KCNH2 Ser55Leu is correctly classified as pathogenic but KCNQ1 Val162Met is benign.ConclusionProximity in sequence space does not always translate accurately to proximity in three-dimensional space. Emerging structural methods will add value to pathogenicity prediction.
