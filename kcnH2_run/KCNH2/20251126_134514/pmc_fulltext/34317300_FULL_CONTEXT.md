## Pseudopolymorphic Wide Complex Tachycardia in a Child With Long QT Syndrome

### Abstract

Implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can be a valuable tool in monitoring patients with inherited arrhythmia. This paper reports on a family with long QT syndrome (type 2 [LQT2]) in which a pseudopolymorphic wide complex tachycardia detected by ILR was ultimately diagnosed as a supraventricular aberrant rhythm, facilitated by noncompliance with beta-blocker therapy. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.)

### History of presentation and medical history

A 42-year-old female patient who presented with multiple past syncopal events related to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and a corrected QT interval (QTc) that was consistently >500 ms. She underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation and had subsequent appropriate therapies triggered by dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Two of her 3 children, a 12-year-old male and an 11-year-old female, both asymptomatic, were subsequently diagnosed with long QT syndrome (LQTS) following electrocardiographic cascade screening, which revealed a QTc >500 ms in both. A single amino acid substitution, G648S, was found in the KCNH2 gene in all 3 affected family members. The third child, a 14-year-old female, was found to be genetically negative, with a normal QTc. The familial variant had been previously reported in the setting of LQT2 in a compendium publication (1). The variant is absent from the control series in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, and the co-segregation with the phenotype in the family supports its pathogenicity (American College of Medical Genetics criteria PP1 [strong evidence]; PP3; PP4; PM4) (2).Learning Objectives•To understand risk stratification and management of young patients with LQTS type 2 and intermediate event risk.•To be familiar with potentially misleading findings on ILRs that must be carefully analyzed.

Although asymptomatic, both affected children had baseline QTc intervals of 510 to 550 ms (Figure 1A), despite therapy with nadolol at 1 mg/kg.Figure 1Baseline Electrocardiogram(A) Baseline electrocardiogram of the affected male reveals normal sinus rhythm and a prolonged corrected QT interval of 507 ms.

(C) Trace from the electrophysiology study demonstrating progressive left bundle branch block with atrial pacing. Note a normal H-V interval, which excludes an atriofascicular accessory pathway. The second T wave is fused with the third QRS complex, appearing as pseudo−pre-excitation. (D) Implantable loop recorder traces in the affected sister show pseudopolymorphic wide-complex tachycardia that transitions into a narrow complex tachycardia spontaneously.

### Investigations

We elected to insert implantable loop recorders (ILRs) in both children to allow for longitudinal monitoring and early detection of arrhythmia. This decision was driven by the markedly prolonged QTc interval in the presence of a high-risk genetic form of LQTS known to incompletely respond to beta-blockers (3).

Six months post-implantation we received 2 alerts from the male child for asymptomatic, polymorphic wide complex tachycardia at a wobbling cycle length of approximately 200 beats/min, with periodic changes in R-wave amplitude, recorded during sleeping hours (Figure 1B). Exercise stress testing was performed and was unrevealing.

### Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis included polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (including antidromic atrioventricular tachycardia), and orthodromic SVT (including re-entrant, atrial, and sinus tachycardia) with aberrancy.

### Management

To elucidate the nature of the tachycardia and to exclude treatable causes, we performed an electrophysiology study (EPS). Dual atrioventricular node physiology was demonstrated, with no inducible arrhythmia in the presence of high-dose isoproterenol and epinephrine (Figure 1C). Importantly, with isoproterenol infusion at 5 μg/min, sinus tachycardia at 200 beats/min was elicited, with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology. Respiratory changes resulted in the aberrant sinus tachycardia appearing as polymorphic, with morphology similar to the original recording from the ILR. The patient admitted later to intermittent noncompliance of taking nadolol, which might have facilitated the occurrence of the nonphysiological rapid sinus tachycardia. Interestingly, 2 months later, the patient’s 11-year-old sister presented with a similar wide complex tachycardia at 200 beats/min recorded on her ILR (Figure 1D). She also admitted noncompliance with nadolol. Her ILR recording revealed a similar pseudopolymorphic wide complex tachycardia, with transition of the same tachycardia to a narrow complex rhythm at a similar rate, reflecting intermittent bundle branch block, and supporting its supraventricular origin. Her exercise stress test was negative for arrhythmia, and no further studies were performed in this family. Importance of beta-blocker compliance was reinforced.

### Discussion

Patients with LQTS are at increased risk for developing life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Risk stratification models used to predict arrhythmia in these patients include the presence of symptoms, QTc interval duration, and specific genotype (4,5). Currently, an ICD implant is indicated as secondary prevention for patients with aborted SCD or with documented ventricular arrhythmia, despite optimal beta-blocker therapy (4). The indication for ICD as primary prevention in asymptomatic patients is controversial and not well defined.

Recently, ILRs were suggested as a monitoring tool for patients who do not meet the criteria for ICD implant but who are considered to be at intermediate arrhythmic risk (6,7). This approach may be particularly helpful in children, for whom the decision to implant an ICD is even more challenging. Longitudinal monitoring in the setting of LQTS might also be helpful in diagnosing abnormal rhythms other than polymorphic VT because supraventricular arrhythmias are increasingly recognized as more often recorded in patients with inherited arrhythmias (8). An ILR should be considered for young individuals with high-risk genetic forms of LQTS and overt clinical phenotypes who still do not meet the indications for primary prevention ICD, to allow closer and more frequent monitoring, as well as early detection of signs of increased arrhythmic risk. Information obtained from ILRs may assist in detecting arrhythmic events in patients who are at increased risk, yet do not meet indications for ICDs. Patients with LQT2 are considered to be at a higher arrhythmic risk compared with those with LQT1 and are less responsive to beta-blocker therapy alone (3). A recent study by Mazzanti et al. (9) demonstrated that the cumulative 5-year risk of patients with LQT2 with a QTc interval of 500 to 520 ms is 5.1% to 6%, that is, more than double the risk of patients with LQT1 with a similar QTc duration. Thus, in patients with LQT2 and a prolonged QTc interval >500 ms despite medical therapy, ILRs may be a valid monitoring strategy.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of an association between LQT2 with a rate-dependent bundle branch block, which is particularly unusual in children in whom LBBB is extremely rare (10). The differential diagnosis workup and the longitudinal evaluation in the entire family was helpful in determining the non−life-threatening nature of the rhythm detected by the ILR and to also unravel the limited compliance with medical therapy, which represents an additional risk in the setting of LQT2.

### Conclusions

Supraventricular rhythms are common in the setting of LQTS and careful differential diagnosis is needed to discriminate aberrant rhythms from ventricular rhythms to avoid unnecessary therapies. Rapid breathing patterns and changes in thoracic volumes, which are more common in pediatric patients, may facilitate aberrant morphology.
