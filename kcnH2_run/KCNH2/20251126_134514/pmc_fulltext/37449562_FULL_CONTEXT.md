## Screening for Rare Coding Variants That Associate With the QTc Interval in Iceland

### Abstract

BackgroundLong‐QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac repolarization abnormality that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The most common causes are rare coding variants in the genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A. The data on LQTS epidemiology are limited, and information on expressivity and penetrance of pathogenic variants is sparse.Methods and ResultsWe screened for rare coding variants associated with the corrected QT (QTc) interval in Iceland. We explored the frequency of the identified variants, their penetrance, and their association with severe events. Twelve variants were associated with the QTc interval. Five in KCNQ1, 3 in KCNH2, 2 in cardiomyopathy genes MYBPC3 and PKP2, and 2 in genes where coding variants have not been associated with the QTc interval, ISOC1 and MYOM2. The combined carrier frequency of the 8 variants in the previously known LQTS genes was 530 per 100 000 individuals (1:190). p.Tyr315Cys and p.Leu273Phe in KCNQ1 were associated with having a mean QTc interval longer than 500 ms (P=4.2×10−7; odds ratio [OR], 38.6; P=8.4×10−10, OR, 26.5; respectively), and p.Leu273Phe was associated with sudden cardiac death (P=0.0034; OR, 2.99). p.Val215Met in KCNQ1 was carried by 1 in 280 Icelanders, had a smaller effect on the QTc interval (P=1.8×10−44; effect, 22.8 ms), and did not associate with severe clinical events.ConclusionsThe carrier frequency of associating variants in LQTS genes was higher than previous estimates of the prevalence of LQTS. The variants have variable effects on the QTc interval, and carriers of p.Tyr315Cys and p.Leu273Phe have a more severe disease than carriers of p.Val215Met. These data could lead to improved identification, risk stratification, and a more precise clinical approach to those with QTc prolongation.

### What Is New?

The study provides unique information on the genetic epidemiology, penetrance of sequence variants, and the association with serious events of long‐QT syndrome.The prevalence of sequence variants associated with corrected QT prolongation was higher than prior estimates that have relied on ECG screening alone and the most frequent sequence variant in Iceland, P.Val215Met in the KCNQ1 gene, a founder mutation, is associated with a less severe phenotype than other variants.

### Methods

The Icelandic Data Protection Authority and the National Bioethics Committee of Iceland (number VSNb2015030024/03.01 and VSNb2015030022/03.01) approved the study, which complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients and controls who donated DNA samples signed informed consent. Personal identifiers of the patient data and biological samples were encrypted with a third‐party system monitored by the Data Protection Authority. The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within this article, its Supplemental Material, and on request.

This study was based on whole‐genome sequence data from 63 118 Icelanders participating in various studies at deCODE Genetics. Variants were imputed, down to a minor allele frequency <0.01%, into 173 025 individuals genotyped with Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism chips, and genotype probabilities for nontyped relatives were calculated based on Icelandic genealogy. The whole‐genome sequencing of the Icelandic population, and the subsequent imputation, have been extensively described in prior publications.

The ECG data were obtained from Landspitali–The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland (Landspitali) and included all ECGs obtained and digitally stored from 1998 to 2015 and ECGs from the deCODE Health Study (dHS). There were 16 502 ECGs obtained from the dHS and 434 000 from Landspitali. The ECGs at Landspitali were obtained in all hospital departments, from both inpatients and outpatients, and digitally recorded with the Philips PageWriter and stored in the Philips TraceMaster ECG Management System. Digitally measured parameters were extracted for analysis. Individuals with pacemakers at the time of measurement were excluded from the analysis. The Philips PageWriter Trim III QT interval measurement algorithm has been previously described and shown to fulfill industrial ECG measurement accuracy standards.
20
 The QTc interval was corrected using the Fridericia formula.
21
 Although the exact definition of a prolonged QTc interval may vary,
22
 a QTc interval of >460 ms for both men and women was defined as prolonged in this study, and the mean measured QTc interval per individual was considered for phenotype ascertainment.

To explore the phenotype of carriers of variants associating with the QTc interval, we used International Classification of Diseases, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Revision (ICD‐8, ICD‐9, ICD‐10) diagnostic codes collected through various studies since 1987, and medical record review was performed for selected subsets of carriers. Syncope was defined as those individuals with a diagnosis of R55 in ICD‐9 and ICD‐10, ventricular tachycardia as I47.2, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) as I46.0–46.9.

To have information about SCD as complete as possible, data from the Capital District Fire and Rescue Service about individuals who suffered from out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest from 2008 until 2018 and data from the Icelandic Causes of Death Registry were used along with appropriate diagnostic codes. The available Icelandic Causes of Death Registry data included the main cause of death of individuals dying after 1975, and medical records were evaluated in an attempt to complete information about deceased carriers as much as possible.

Medical records were also evaluated of all carriers of QTc variants who died before the age of 75 years with a cardiac‐related main cause of death or unspecified causes of death (ICD‐10 codes R.00.0‐R00.9, I20‐I79, R95‐R99). Evaluation of medical records confirmed all SCD cases of the p.Leu273Phe and p.Cys315Tyr sequence variants in KCNQ1 and validated the accuracy of cause of death in the Causes of Death Registry.

Information about use of β‐blockers (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code C07*) was obtained from the Prescriptions Medicines Registry, an electronic database for outpatient prescriptions in Iceland initiated in 2002. A total of 101 individuals have been given the ICD codes 426.82 or I45.81 (LQTS).

Quantitative traits were tested using a BOLT linear mixed model
23
 and binary traits with a logistic regression model. We assumed an additive model, treating disease status as the response and expected genotype counts from imputation as covariates. This was done using software developed at deCODE Genetics.
19
 Sex, county of birth, current age or age at death (first‐ and second‐order terms included), blood sample availability for the individual, and an indicator function for the overlap of the lifetime of the individual with the time span of the phenotype collection were adjusted for in the regression when analyzing case–control traits, and age and sex when analyzing the quantitative traits. The first 10 principal components correlate with county of birth, only explain 0.085% of the variance in the QTc measures, and it was not necessary to include them as covariates.
24
 When multiple measurements were available for individuals, the mean value was used in association analysis. Because LQTS‐causing variants are not common, we tested rare coding sequence variants (minor allele frequency <1%) for associations and applied a Bonferroni correction for 290 589 variants tested (Figure S1). This resulted in a significance threshold of 1.7×10−7. Given prior knowledge, we specifically analyzed the association between the QTc interval and rare coding variants in the well‐established LQTS genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A, and adjusted for significance using the number of coding variants in these genes with a false discovery rate procedure.

### Phenotypic Data

To explore the phenotype of carriers of variants associating with the QTc interval, we used International Classification of Diseases, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Revision (ICD‐8, ICD‐9, ICD‐10) diagnostic codes collected through various studies since 1987, and medical record review was performed for selected subsets of carriers.

 and binary traits with a logistic regression model. We assumed an additive model, treating disease status as the response and expected genotype counts from imputation as covariates. This was done using software developed at deCODE Genetics.

Because LQTS‐causing variants are not common, we tested rare coding sequence variants (minor allele frequency <1%) for associations and applied a Bonferroni correction for 290 589 variants tested (Figure S1). This resulted in a significance threshold of 1.7×10−7. Given prior knowledge, we specifically analyzed the association between the QTc interval and rare coding variants in the well‐established LQTS genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A, and adjusted for significance using the number of coding variants in these genes with a false discovery rate procedure.

### Results

To search for rare (minor allele frequency <1%) protein coding variants that associate with the QT interval, we tested for association between the mean automated QTc interval measurements derived from 95 112 individuals and 290 589 rare protein coding variants. The mean analyzed QTc interval was 414.0 ms (SD, 25.3 ms), 419.2 ms in the Landspitali data and 413.3 ms in the dHS data. In the Landspitali data, 4.9 QTc interval measures were available per individual, and mean age at the median measurement was 57.6 years. The mean QTc interval was >460 ms for 4.4% of individuals and >500 ms for 0.5%. In the dHS data, the age at measure was 54.8 years, and the QTc interval was >460 ms for 3.7% of individuals and >500 ms for 0.5% (Table S1; Figure S2).

Eight variants were associated with the QTc interval (Table 1; Figure). Four were in the LQTS gene KCNQ1, 2 in known cardiomyopathy genes, MYBPC3 and PKP2, and 2 in genes where coding variants have up to this time not been associated with the QTc interval or other cardiac diseases, ISOC1 and MYOM2. Common intronic variants in MYOM2 have previously been associated with the JT and QRS duration.
25
 For rare coding variants in the well‐established LQTS genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A, we specifically analyzed association with the QTc interval and adjusted for significance using the 94 tested variants. Using this approach (P<0.0043), 1 other variant in KCNQ1, and 3 in KCNH2 associated with the QTc interval resulted in 12 significant variants in total. Out of 43 rare coding variants in SCN5A that were tested in the study, none were associated with the QTc interval.

Variants Found in Iceland That Associate With the Corrected QT Interval

The associations are shown for both the 8 variants identified in the exome‐wide association study approach and the 4 variants found when LQTS genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A were specifically analyzed. Classification of the variants in ClinVar is shown. AF indicates allele frequency; Amaj, major allele; Amin, minor allele, which is the effect allele; ARVC, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; Chr, chromosome; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; LQTS, long‐QT syndrome; and Pos, position in build hg38.

The red line indicates a 414‐ms mean of the population where carriers of QTc interval variants have been excluded. QTc indicates corrected QT.

Of the variants tested in known LQTS genes, p.Tyr315Cys (allele frequency [AF], 0.015%), p.Leu273Phe (AF, 0.037%), p.Val215Met (AF, 0.18%), p.Arg594Ter (AF, 0.024%), and p.Ile263LysfsTer26 (AF, 0.004%) in KCNQ1 and p.Pro968AlafsTer151 (AF, 0.006%), p.Trp412Arg (AF, 0.002%), and p.Cys66Ser (AF, 0.001%) in KCNH2 were associated with a prolonged QTc. p.Tyr315Cys, carried by 1 in 3330 Icelanders, conferred the largest effect (P=3.3×10−28; effect, 56.7 ms). The more common p.Val215Met, carried by 1 in 280 Icelanders, had the smallest effect among the variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (P=1.8×10−44; effect, 22.8 ms). The other rare coding variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 had an effect range from 30.8 to 55.7 ms.

We looked up the reported classification of pathogenicity from the ClinVar database
26
 (downloaded on May 11, 2021) for all 94 coding variants tested in the established LQTS genes and compared it with their association with the QTc interval (Table S2). Of the 8 variants in these genes that were associated with the QTc interval in our study, 4 are reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar, 1 is of unknown significance, and 3 have not been classified (Table 1). The most frequent of these variants, which also had the smallest effect on the QTc interval, p.Val215Met in KCNQ1, is reported as of unknown significance. When applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification,
27
 all variants apart from p.Val215Met and p.Trp412Arg were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for LQTS. When classifying the variants, we did not use evidence from the associations with the QTc interval, which would add even more support to their classification as pathogenic for LQTS (Table S3).

Of the 94 variants, 40 are likely benign for LQTS given their frequency and small effect on the QTc interval, resulting in a 95% CI upper bound <15 ms from the mean. We consider other variants to be of unknown significance. Four of the associating variants are in non‐LQTS genes. The missense variant p.Gly256Arg (AF, 0.58%) in ISOC1, carried by 1 in 80 Icelanders, associated most significantly of all variants with the QTc interval and resulted in a 14.6 ms prolongation on average (P=1.5×10−58), which is significantly smaller than those of the variants in the LQTS genes. The variant is not correlated with top expression quantitative loci in publicly available Genotype‐Tissue Expression project data.
28
 A stop‐gain variant, p.Gln1386Ter (AF, 0.13%) in MYOM2, carried by 1 in 420 Icelanders, was associated with a shortening of the QTc interval (P=7.1×10−11; effect, −11.4 ms; Figure S3). Two variants in cardiac genes, 1 in MYBPC3 (P=7.4×10−28; effect, 15.6 ms) and 1 in PKP2 (P=2.1×10−8; effect, 11.4 ms), that are known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
15
 and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,16 respectively, were also associated with a prolonged QTc interval (Table 1). Because premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) on an ECG can interfere with QT measurement, and PKP2 variant carriers have frequent PVCs, we explored if ECG statement codes that show PVCs affect the QTc association. Excluding individuals with PVCs does not explain the QTc variant association, with carriers without PVCs having on average 10.4‐ms longer QTc than noncarriers. The PKP2 carriers that had ventricular tachycardia, had their ECGs manually reviewed, and had monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. This would suggest that the arrhythmia is more likely associated with structural heart disorder than the prolonged QTc.

The combined frequency of the 8 coding sequence variants in the established LQTS genes that prolonged the QTc interval was 530 per 100 000 individuals (1:190). If we omit p.Val215Met in KCNQ1, which is a founder mutation in the Icelandic population, the frequency decreases to 180 per 100 000 individuals (1:560) (Table 2).

Characteristics of Carriers of the Sequence Variants in the Established LQTS Genes in Iceland

Percent of carriers with extreme risk (mean QTc >500 ms) and penetrance of LQTS (mean QTc intervals >460 ms) are reported among carriers with available ECGs. β‐blocker prescription rate among carriers is regardless of indication. AF is shown for each variant and combined. AF indicates allele frequency; LQTS, long‐QT syndrome; and QTc, corrected QT.

Among individuals with available ECGs, the fraction of carriers with mean QTc interval ≥460 ms was 140 per 100 000 or 87 per 100 000 if omitting p.Val215Met in KCNQ1. Of carriers of QT variants in the known LQTS genes and available ECGs, 32.9% (141/429) had a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms. ECG data were not available for 62% of carriers. The prevalence of mean QTc interval ≥460 ms was similar in the dHS and Landspitali data sets (3.7% compared with 4.4%).

To explore the phenotypic effects of the 12 variants in more detail, we tested them for association with lifespan, SCD (Ncases=4763), ventricular tachycardia (Ncases=1110), syncope and collapse (Ncases=19 723), having mean QTc interval ≥460 and 500 ms, and having an ICD code used for LQTS (ICD‐9 426.82 and ICD‐10 I45.81) (Table 3).

Associations of the Identified Variants With Binary End Points

P values, ORs, and effects are shown for each variant. AF indicates allele frequency; Amaj, major allele; Amin, minor allele, which is the effect allele; Chr, chromosome; ICD, International Classification of Diseases; LQTS, long‐QT syndrome; OR, odds ratio; Pos, position in build hg38; QTc, corrected QT; SCD, sudden cardiac death; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

After accounting for number of variants tested using a false discovery rate procedure, all QTc variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 were associated with a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms. p.Tyr315Cys and p.Leu273Phe in KCNQ1 were the only ones that were associated with having a LQTS ICD code diagnosis (P=7.2×10−15; odds ratio [OR], 228.9; and P=4.2×10−32; OR, 328.5, respectively). Both of these variants were also associated with a mean QTc interval ≥500 ms (P=4.2×10−7; OR, 38.6; and P=8.4×10−10; OR, 26.5, respectively), a value that is associated with a high risk of ventricular tachycardia. In total, 16.6% of p.Tyr315Cys and 11.4% of p.Leu273Phe carriers, with available ECGs, had a mean QTc interval ≥500 ms. Respectively, 76.6% and 61.4% of carriers of these variants had a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms, suggesting high penetrance (Table 2). Carriers of these variants also had a higher proportion of β‐blocker prescriptions than carriers of other variants (Table 2). The p.Leu273Phe variant in KCNQ1 was associated with the risk of SCD (P=0.0066; OR, 3.16), and p.Tyr315Cys was associated with syncope and collapse (P=0.0034; OR, 2.99). A lower percentage of p.Val215Met carriers had mean QTc ≥460 ms (19.3%) and mean QTc interval ≥500 ms (2.9%), suggesting a milder phenotype for this most frequent variant. p.Val215Met in KCNQ1 was not associated with SCD (P=0.85; OR, 1.05), but there was statistical power to detect association with OR above 1.58 for this variant. p.Cys66Ser in KCNH2 was the only LQTS gene variant that was associated with shorter lifespan (P=0.0052; effect, −1.86 SD). c.927‐2A>G in MYBPC3 was associated with SCD (P=0.0040; OR, 1.93), ventricular tachycardia (P=8.0×10−15; OR, 8.12), and lifespan (P=3.4×10−5; effect, −0.22 SD), and p.His689ProfsTer8 in PKP2 with ventricular tachycardia (P=0.00076; OR, 4.58). These variants likely prolong the QTc interval due to conduction abnormalities secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
29
 and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
16

Because it is difficult to impute rare variants in the whole‐genome sequencing set (eg, singletons and de novo variants), they cannot be tested for association with QTc interval. Using the whole‐genome sequencing data of 63 118 individuals, we screened for rare variants in the LQTS genes that were reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. Three sequence variants, p.Asp446Asn and p.Arg231Ser in KCNQ1 and p.Ile593Thr in KCNH2 were carried by fewer than 5 individuals each, with at least 1 carrier with a mean QTc >460 ms.

### Rare Sequence Variants Associated With the QTc Interval

Of the variants tested in known LQTS genes, p.Tyr315Cys (allele frequency [AF], 0.015%), p.Leu273Phe (AF, 0.037%), p.Val215Met (AF, 0.18%), p.Arg594Ter (AF, 0.024%), and p.Ile263LysfsTer26 (AF, 0.004%) in KCNQ1 and p.Pro968AlafsTer151 (AF, 0.006%), p.Trp412Arg (AF, 0.002%), and p.Cys66Ser (AF, 0.001%) in KCNH2 were associated with a prolonged QTc. p.Tyr315Cys, carried by 1 in 3330 Icelanders, conferred the largest effect (P=3.3×10−28; effect, 56.7 ms). The more common p.Val215Met, carried by 1 in 280 Icelanders, had the smallest effect among the variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (P=1.8×10−44; effect, 22.8 ms). The other rare coding variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 had an effect range from 30.8 to 55.7 ms.

This would suggest that the arrhythmia is more likely associated with structural heart disorder than the prolonged QTc.

### Genetic Epidemiology of LQTS Based on Associating Variants in LQTS Genes

The combined frequency of the 8 coding sequence variants in the established LQTS genes that prolonged the QTc interval was 530 per 100 000 individuals (1:190). If we omit p.Val215Met in KCNQ1, which is a founder mutation in the Icelandic population, the frequency decreases to 180 per 100 000 individuals (1:560) (Table 2).

Among individuals with available ECGs, the fraction of carriers with mean QTc interval ≥460 ms was 140 per 100 000 or 87 per 100 000 if omitting p.Val215Met in KCNQ1. Of carriers of QT variants in the known LQTS genes and available ECGs, 32.9% (141/429) had a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms. ECG data were not available for 62% of carriers. The prevalence of mean QTc interval ≥460 ms was similar in the dHS and Landspitali data sets (3.7% compared with 4.4%).

### Evaluation of the Phenotypic Effects of Associating Variants

To explore the phenotypic effects of the 12 variants in more detail, we tested them for association with lifespan, SCD (Ncases=4763), ventricular tachycardia (Ncases=1110), syncope and collapse (Ncases=19 723), having mean QTc interval ≥460 and 500 ms, and having an ICD code used for LQTS (ICD‐9 426.82 and ICD‐10 I45.81) (Table 3).

Associations of the Identified Variants With Binary End Points

P values, ORs, and effects are shown for each variant. AF indicates allele frequency; Amaj, major allele; Amin, minor allele, which is the effect allele; Chr, chromosome; ICD, International Classification of Diseases; LQTS, long‐QT syndrome; OR, odds ratio; Pos, position in build hg38; QTc, corrected QT; SCD, sudden cardiac death; and VT, ventricular tachycardia.

After accounting for number of variants tested using a false discovery rate procedure, all QTc variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 were associated with a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms. p.Tyr315Cys and p.Leu273Phe in KCNQ1 were the only ones that were associated with having a LQTS ICD code diagnosis (P=7.2×10−15; odds ratio [OR], 228.9; and P=4.2×10−32; OR, 328.5, respectively). Both of these variants were also associated with a mean QTc interval ≥500 ms (P=4.2×10−7; OR, 38.6; and P=8.4×10−10; OR, 26.5, respectively), a value that is associated with a high risk of ventricular tachycardia. In total, 16.6% of p.Tyr315Cys and 11.4% of p.Leu273Phe carriers, with available ECGs, had a mean QTc interval ≥500 ms. Respectively, 76.6% and 61.4% of carriers of these variants had a mean QTc interval ≥460 ms, suggesting high penetrance (Table 2). Carriers of these variants also had a higher proportion of β‐blocker prescriptions than carriers of other variants (Table 2). The p.Leu273Phe variant in KCNQ1 was associated with the risk of SCD (P=0.0066; OR, 3.16), and p.Tyr315Cys was associated with syncope and collapse (P=0.0034; OR, 2.99). A lower percentage of p.Val215Met carriers had mean QTc ≥460 ms (19.3%) and mean QTc interval ≥500 ms (2.9%), suggesting a milder phenotype for this most frequent variant. p.Val215Met in KCNQ1 was not associated with SCD (P=0.85; OR, 1.05), but there was statistical power to detect association with OR above 1.58 for this variant. p.Cys66Ser in KCNH2 was the only LQTS gene variant that was associated with shorter lifespan (P=0.0052; effect, −1.86 SD). c.927‐2A>G in MYBPC3 was associated with SCD (P=0.0040; OR, 1.93), ventricular tachycardia (P=8.0×10−15; OR, 8.12), and lifespan (P=3.4×10−5; effect, −0.22 SD), and p.His689ProfsTer8 in PKP2 with ventricular tachycardia (P=0.00076; OR, 4.58). These variants likely prolong the QTc interval due to conduction abnormalities secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
29
 and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

### Rare Sequence Variants in the LQTS Genes

Because it is difficult to impute rare variants in the whole‐genome sequencing set (eg, singletons and de novo variants), they cannot be tested for association with QTc interval. Using the whole‐genome sequencing data of 63 118 individuals, we screened for rare variants in the LQTS genes that were reported as pathogenic in ClinVar. Three sequence variants, p.Asp446Asn and p.Arg231Ser in KCNQ1 and p.Ile593Thr in KCNH2 were carried by fewer than 5 individuals each, with at least 1 carrier with a mean QTc >460 ms.

### Discussion

In this study, whole‐genome sequence data were used to search for rare coding variants that were associated with the QTc interval in Iceland. We found 12 variants that were associated with the QTc interval and explored their association with severe events. Five in the LQTS gene KCNQ1, 3 in KCNH2, 2 in known cardiomyopathy genes, MYBPC3 and PKP2, and 2 in genes where rare coding variants have not been associated with the QTc interval, ISOC1 and MYOM2. The results also provide new information on the genotype–phenotype relationship of these sequence variants and the variable risk of serious adverse effects. In addition, these data give new insight into the allelic frequency of sequence variants in LQTS genes. The prevalence of this disorder, restricting the analysis to known LQTS genes, was shown to be higher than previously reported based on clinical studies only. The results could have implications for risk stratification of carriers of these sequence variants and provide an opportunity to implement a precision medicine approach to QTc prolongation in Iceland.

Guidelines agree that LQTS can be diagnosed if a pathogenic sequence variant is identified, regardless of the QTc interval as evaluated on ECG.

 However, it is not well established which variants are pathogenic. The variants found in this study have a variable effect on the QTc interval and risk of serious event. It is also not clear how large the effect on the QTc interval needs to be for a variant to be classified as pathogenic, and our data suggest that a more detailed risk stratification than simply classifying them as pathogenic or not is needed.

The prevalence of LQTS has previously been estimated using large prospective ECG studies and was found to be 1 in 2000 to 2500 in Italian and Japanese infants.
17
, 
30
 In this Icelandic cohort, the prevalence of rare sequence variants in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 that were associated with QTc prolongation was found to be substantially higher, both the number of carriers alone and even when restricting the analysis to carriers with an ECG with mean QTc >460 ms. The prevalence of sequence variants in this study is closer to that reported in a Norwegian genotyped cohort, where it was ≈1 in 1000.
18
 Individuals who are genotype positive may have a normal QTc interval on ECG, and the proportion of phenotype‐negative carriers has been estimated to be as high as 40%.

, 
8
 These carriers might easily be missed with ECG screening alone, and therefore the true prevalence of LQTS is most certainly underestimated in studies that are only based on ECG screening.

We chose a different approach (ie, genetic screening) to try to estimate the carrier frequency of QTc prolonging variants. In this study, we identified all carriers in a large genetic data set of rare coding variants associated with QTc interval. Although known sequence variants are believed to account for up to 70% of all inherited cases, this number, however, may be an underestimate due to previous evaluation of individuals with a borderline phenotype or limitations to the methodology of genotyping.

The high prevalence of sequence variants in LQTS genes in Iceland may in large part be explained by the p.Val215Met in the KCNQ1 founder mutation, but after exclusion of this variant, mutations in these genes are, nevertheless, more common than previously reported, 180 per 100.000 individuals (1:560). However, this information should be interpreted with some caution, not least the genetic epidemiology data that included p.Val215Met, because these findings do not necessarily equate to a diagnosis of LQTS. Geographical variation in prevalence of the QTc prolongation is perhaps to be expected, but with the advent of high‐throughput genomic technologies, it is likely that the estimated prevalence will begin to increase.

The p.Val215Met variant has been reported in association with LQTS, but only in a few individuals
31
,

33
 and is reported as a variant of uncertain clinical significance in ClinVar. Functional studies have reported that p.Val215Met alters potassium channel current function and may have a destabilizing effect on the S3 subunit of the KCNQ1 protein.
34
, 
35
 Because of its high frequency in the Icelandic population, this study provides new information about its phenotypic manifestations and clinical significance. The p.Val215Met variant in KCNQ1 does have a significant effect on the QTc interval (>20 ms) but does not associate with increased rate of serious events such as SCD. It has been reported that p.Tyr111Cys in KCNQ1, a founder variant in the Swedish population, has not been associated with high incidence of life‐threatening events showing similarities to p.Val215Met in the Icelandic population.
36
, 
37

Of note, early‐onset SCD was seen in 2 female patients with the p.Val215Met variant suffering from eating disorders and severe hypokalemia at the time of cardiac arrest. It is known that LQTS carriers are more susceptible to LQTS‐triggered cardiac events when hypokalemic.
38
, 
39
 There are reports that severe hypokalemia may be of critical importance in triggering lethal arrhythmias in a subset of patients with LQTS and a mild phenotype, as described in our p.Val215Met variant cohort.
40
 Therefore, we conclude that this variant is unlikely to confer increased risk of SCD in the baseline state but may render the individual more susceptible to serious events under certain clinical circumstances such as electrolyte disturbance and possibly when taking QT‐prolonging medications. Thus, the p.Val215VMet variant may be considered more as a risk factor than a pathogenic LQTS variant in the classical sense.

Knowing the effect size of a variant on the QTc is valuable when assessing pathogenicity. In this study, p.Val215Met is a relatively frequent coding variant in KCNQ1 associating with the QTc interval, and we did not see a large effect on severe events and outcomes. Carriers of the variant have on average ≈20‐ms longer QTc interval. If variants’ mean effect of an association is below that, it might be viewed as a risk factor rather than being pathogenic for LQTS until additional evidence would imply pathogenicity. The variant is, in our opinion, a genetic risk factor but does not fit well into current classification systems for LQTS that do not acknowledge different risk among pathogenic variants.

In this study, only 1 of the rare coding variants in the KCNQ1 gene, p.Leu273Phe, was associated with a risk of SCD. p.Leu273Phe causes on average a large prolongation in the QTc interval, and as such supports previous findings that a longer QTc interval predisposes to an elevated risk of SCD.
7
 Approximately 60% of carriers had a QTc interval exceeding 460 ms.
41
 Just >75% of the carriers of p.Tyr315Cys and 60% of the p.Leu273Phe carriers in our data have a mean QTc interval that exceeds 460 ms. Our results, therefore, do provide insights into high‐risk variants that can be useful in the general context outside of Iceland. p.Tyr315Cys has been identified in studies elsewhere, and Mazzanti et al have described the penetrance of a LQTS phenotype in KCNQ1 p.Tyr315Cys carriers.
41

The association of a rare variant with prolongation of the QTc interval does not necessarily mean that it is pathogenic for LQTS. However, all of the associating variants in LQTS genes identified in the study, apart from p.Val215Met and p.Trp412Arg, were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for LQTS using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. In addition, they have a large effect on the QTc interval in the population, which supports that they are pathogenic for LQTS.

It has been demonstrated that individuals with sequence variants that carry the highest risk for SCD could benefit most from treatment with β‐blockers.
42
 However, it has been suggested that those with low‐risk variants might only need to observe preventative lifestyle measures, such as avoiding situations that are known to be potential triggers for an arrhythmia, drugs that can prolong the QT interval, and certain clinical circumstances such as hypokalemia.
43
 Although international guidelines currently recommend that β‐blockers should be considered for everyone with LQTS, regardless of the QTc interval or symptoms, side effects of this therapy are common.

Most Icelanders who carry mutations associated with LQTS are unaware of it. On the other hand, some have been diagnosed clinically with LQTS. Knowledge of LQTS mutation carrier status might be an opportunity for timely intervention to prevent sudden death. Extensive accumulation of data on genetics and other contributors to human diversity form the backbone of precision medicine, which has the goal of providing more efficient and effective care, but also to reduce complications and limit cost from unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.
44
 Risk stratification is of considerable importance for individuals with sequence variants associated with QTc prolongation. The phenotypic expression and clinical consequences of the sequence variants found in this study were variable and provide valuable information on the clinical spectrum of sequence variants associated with QTc prolongation in Iceland. The value of knowledge of the genetic make‐up of diseases in specific populations is underscored by the findings that the most common QTc prolonging variant in Iceland, p.Val215Met, has been reported elsewhere only on rare occasions. The data also point toward the possibility of basing specific therapeutic recommendations on genotype information in the future.

A limitation of the study is that the classification of rare variants, such as singletons or de novo mutations, as pathogenic can be difficult. Also, when exploring association between rare variants and SCD, there may be insufficient statistical power to detect significant associations. Mutations causing severe LQTS may also be removed quickly from the population through natural selection, and the variants may only be present in the pediatric population, which was outside the scope of this study. When analyzing the QT interval, there were on average 4.9 ECGs available per individuals, and the mean QTc was used in the analysis. This can potentially lead to a bias in effect estimates but will underestimate the effects of pathogenic variants rather than overestimate.

### Conclusions

In summary, the prevalence of sequence variants associated with QTc prolongation in Iceland is higher than previous estimates using ECGs and partial molecular screening only. The most frequent variant, p.Val215Met in KCNQ1, a founder mutation, has a less severe phenotype than other variants. Ultimately, extensive knowledge about genotype–phenotype relationship, such as presented here, could lead to improved identification and risk stratification of individuals with QT prolonging variants and potentially a more effective clinical approach.
