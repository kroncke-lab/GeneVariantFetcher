### PREAMBLE

The Japanese Circulation Society (JCS) published the “Guidelines for Pharmacological Treatment of Arrhythmia” in 2004, and a revised edition was published in 2009.
1
 Both guidelines have recommended that selection of the appropriate treatment should be based on the concept of the Sicilian Gambit approach. However, pharmacological therapy for arrhythmia based on the pharmacological action of antiarrhythmic agents does not always lead to appropriate therapy in real‐world clinical practice. On the other hand, the majority of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are performed in Western countries, so some of the antiarhythmic drugs are not available in Japan and dose of the drugs will also be different from that used in Japan. In addition, because of differences in lifestyle and ethnicity, including genetic factors, the results of RCTs in Western countries might not directly apply to Japanese. To solve these issues, many large‐scale multicenter studies and nationwide registry studies have been performed since the J‐RHYTHM study, and recently, Japanese evidence associated with pharmacological treatment of arrhythmias has become available. It is important to consider the mechanisms of drug action and pharmacokinetics in order to choose the appropriate therapy with high effectiveness and safety for the patient. Therefore, in the present guideline, we introduce the Vaughan Williams classification as well as the Sicilian Gambit approach.

There are 2 major points of difference from the previous editions. One is the role of antiarrhythmic agents for the treatment of arrhythmia. The goal of pharmacological therapy is to improve the prognosis and quality of life (QOL) rather than merely termination and prevention of arrhythmia. The superiority of non‐pharmacological therapy with implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death as compared with pharmacological therapy has been reported. However, the effect of non‐pharmacological therapies is limited in terms of the risk of recurrence, complications, and cost effectiveness for some patients. With the emphasis on health life expectancy, especially in aging societies, such as Japan, QOL‐targeted pharmacological therapy is essential for the patient with arrhythmia. The 2nd difference is the direct oral anticoagulation drugs that are now widespread in Japan. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) has increased and is now considered as a “common disease” in Japan. Therefore, more effective and safe treatment is needed for the patients with AF. Definition of the disease, risk stratification and indication for anticoagulation therapy are important for the patients with AF. In a previous guideline “Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013)”,
2
 mitral valve plasty without artificial valve was defined as “non‐valvular” and valve replacement with artificial valve including mechanical valve and bioprosthetic was defined as “valvular” Since then, evidence associated with valvular disease and AF has increased such that, in the present guideline, artificial valve using a bioprosthetic valve is defined as “non‐valvular”. Accordingly, a prosthetic valve in transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis is considered as “non‐valvular”.

In recent guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, Heart Rhythm Society, and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, CHA2DS2‐VASc is used for risk stratification of ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism. In the present guideline, the CHADS2 score was chosen for risk stratification and indication of the anticoagulation therapy.

This revised version of “2020 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” was prepared as a joint guideline by the JCS and the Japanese Heart Rhythm Society (JHRS).

The main audience of the present guideline is cardiologists, but it will be useful for the general physician and emergency physician. There are many figures and flowcharts that would be useful in clinical practice.The present guideline does not recommend the use of antiarrhythmic drugs but indicates general references of the pharmacological treatment for the patient with arrhythmia. The final decision should be made by physician based on the individual patient’s condition.Antiarrhythmic drugs are chosen according to their importance and high prevalence in general practice. Not all drugs are indicated in the tables and flowcharts.Recommendations of antiarrhythmic drugs are prioritized by evidence levels. It is important to note that some of the drugs are not approved for use in Japan.

The present guideline investigated the recommendations and levels of evidence as described in the ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines (Tables 1 and 2). Guidelines published by the JCS have extensively used a common style that is highly consistent with Western guidelines. However, the Japan Council for Quality Health Care uses a different style in its Medical Information Network Distribution Service (MINDS) to show grades of recommendations and levels of evidence, as described in the “Minds Handbook for Clinical Practice Guideline Development 2007” (Tables 3 and 4).
3
 Therefore, in the present guideline both styles are used in the tables (class of recommendation, level of evidence, grade of recommendation [MINDS] and level of evidence [MINDS]). However, because the concepts of classification differe between the AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines and MINDS, some discrepancy in the evidence level is possible.

### MECHANISMS OF A RRHY THMIA DEVELOPMENT AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC DRUGS

Electrophysiological mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia are divided into 2 categories: (1) abnormal impulse generation and (2) abnormal impulse conduction. The former includes abnormalities in automaticity and triggered activity, and the latter includes reentry. This section is an overview of these arrhythmogenic mechanisms.

Automaticity is the ability of cardiac cells to undergo spontaneous slow diastolic depolarization and initiate an electrical impulse in the absence of external electrical stimulation.
6
 Normal automaticity occurs in a variety of cardiac tissues, including the sinoatrial node, some parts of the atria, pulmonary veins, the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the His–Purkinje system. Spontaneous depolarization is the result of the development of a net inward ionic current during the diastolic phase of the action potential (Figure 1A). Two mechanisms for spontaneous depolarization, which is referred to as a “clock”, are involved in spontaneous pacemaking: the membrane potential clock results from interactions of several sarcolemmal ion channels and transporters, and the Ca2+ clock is intracellular Ca2+ cycling mediated by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and uptake. β
1‐adrenergic receptor stimulation by sympathetic nervous tone and catecholamines accelerates the intrinsic rate of automaticity by increasing the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization, whereas M2‐muscarinic receptor stimulation by parasympathetic nervous tone slows the intrinsic rate by decreasing the slope of the diastolic depolarization and hyperpolarizing the diastolic membrane potential.

Normal (A) and abnormal (B) automaticity, and triggered activities mediated by either early afterdepolarization (C) or delayed afterdepolarization (D).

Working myocardial cells in the atria and ventricles show abnormal automaticity when their resting membrane potential is partially depolarized (Figure 1B). The Ca2+ current, I
Ca, is responsible for the spontaneous action potential upstroke through the the mechanism of abnormal automaticity.
6
 In the acute phase of myocardial ischemia, extracellular K+ accumulation‐induced partial membrane depolarization may cause abnormal automaticity in ventricular cells and Purkinje fibers in the ischemic border zone.

Triggered activity is a term used to describe the initiation of electrical excitation from oscillatory afterdepolarizations that follow the action potential upstroke.
6
 Afterdepolarizations are classified into 2 groups: early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs).

EADs are oscillations in membrane potential during the plateau phase (phase 2) or repolarization phase (phase 3) of the action potential (Figure 1C), as a consequence of either an increase in depolarizing inward currents, including I
Ca, the late Na+ channel current, late I
Na and the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current I
NCX, or a decrease in the outward currents, including the transient outward current, I
to, the delayed rectifier K+ currents, I
Kr and I
Ks, and the inward‐rectifier K+ current, I
K1.
6
 The action potential plateau phase is especially vulnerable because the repolarizing and depolarizing currents are nearly balanced, and a small increase in the net inward current can cause prolongation of the action potential, inducing EADs. This type of EAD is believed to be the major trigger for torsades de pointes (TdPs)‐type polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with long QT syndromes. EADs may also contribute to arrhythmogenesis in the failing heart with electrical remodeling featuring action potential prolongation. Bradycardia and hypokalemia may facilitate this type of EAD by enhancing the prolongation of the action potential. EADs may occur during the repolarization phase of the action potential (phase 3 EADs) in cardiac myocytes with short action potentials (e.g., atrial and pulmonary vein myocardial cells). Phase 3 EADs are initiated by the Ca2+ transient during the action potential, which produces a large inward I
NCX at a negative membrane potential level during action potential repolarization.

DADs are oscillations in membrane potential after complete action potential repolarization under pathological conditions of Ca2+ overload
6
, 
7
 (Figure 1D). Increased intracellular Ca2+ content can initiate spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which activates a transient inward current, I
ti. The inward I
NCX is the major component of I
ti. Factors inducing intracellular Ca2+ overload include catecholamines, digitalis, tachycardia, hypokalemia, and ischemia/reperfusion. Dysfunction of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels can also initiate spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release and induce DADs, which contributes to arrhythmogenic mechanisms in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Purkinje fibers are more susceptible to spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release and DAD‐mediated triggered activity than ventricular cells.

A cardiac excitation wave may return to and re‐excite myocardial tissues that have been excited by the same excitation wave, and this phenomenon is referred to as reentry. Reentry can occur around a fixed anatomic obstacle, such as myocardial infarction scar or valve annulus, or through an anatomic circuit consisting of the normal AV conduction system and accessory pathways. Anatomic reentry is initiated by unidirectional conduction block and is maintained by the presence of an excitable gap between the reentrant wave front and its tail of refractoriness.

Reentry can be established around an area of functional conduction block without anatomic obstacles.
8
 Two theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of functional reentry: (1) leading circle theory
9
 and (2) spiral wave reentry concept.
8
 The leading circle model is characterized by a functionally refractory core and an excitation wave circulating around the inactive core without a fully excitable gap
9
 (Figure 2A). Spiral wave reentry is driven by an electrical rotor around a functional pivot point where a spiral‐shaped excitation wave front meets its own wave tail
9
 (Figure 2B). Stationary rotors in the ventricles provide an electrogram pattern of monomorphic tachycardia, whereas meandering rotors give rise to polymorphic tachycardia. Spiral wave breakup into multiple rotors may correspond to degeneration from tachycardia to fibrillation

11
 (Figure 2C). Myocardial tissues with a preserved long action potential plateau can re‐excite tissues with highly abbreviated action potentials when these sites have been recovered from refractoriness. This type of re‐excitation is referred to as phase 2 reentry and is thought to be a mechanism of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in Brugada syndrome and during acute myocardial ischemia.

).

The Vaughan Williams classification,
13
 which was publicized in 1969, classifies antiarrhythmic drugs into 4 classes. Originally, class I represented Na+ channel blockers, class II sympathetic β‐blockers, class III agents prolonging action potential duration (APD), and class IV Ca2+ channel blockers. Subsequently, class I was found to consist of drugs with various actions on ECG, and thus Harrison
14
 classified class I drugs into 3 subclasses. Class IA drugs prolong the PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval, class IB drugs shorten the QT interval without effects on the PR interval nor QRS duration, and class IC drugs prolong the PR interval and QRS duration without effects on the QT interval (Table 5). These differential effects on ECG parameters are caused by the rate of their binding to and dissociation from the Na+ channels. Class IB drugs have the fastest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus the drugs that bind to the channels during the systolic period are absent in the channels in the diastolic period, rendering no effects on the PR interval or QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IC drugs have the slowest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus these drugs are still bound to the channels when the diastolic period is over, causing prolongation of the PR interval and QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IA drugs are intermediate between these 2 classes of drugs. It has been shown that APD prolongation by class III drugs is caused by K+ channel blockade.
14
 QT interval prolongation by class IA drugs is caused by APD prolongation, which is also attributed to K+ channel blockade.

Vaughan Williams Classification

Abbreviation: APD, action potential duration.

Sudden death after myocardial infarction had been a serious social problem in Europe and the USA since the 1970s. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are indicators of sudden death, so class I drugs were prescribed to suppress PVCs without verified evidence they reduced the risk of sudden death. In 1989, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was performed to validate the efficacy of this strategy and the result was shocking: class I drugs flecainide and encainide even increased the incidence of sudden death after myocardial infarction.
15
 The result of CAST provoked the claim that the Vaughan Williams classification did not precisely represent the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) characterized the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on electrophysiology and electrocardiogram as the Principle of the Sicilian Gambit.

 (Table 6). It is worth noting that digitalis, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and atropine that have been used against arrhythmias were newly classified as antiarrhythmic drugs in the Sicilian Gambit.

The actions of antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered based on their effects on electrophysiological parameters, such as refractory period, conduction, and excitability of cells. These are labeled as “vulnerable factors”. Let’s discuss the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs against reentrant arrhythmia with a certain length of reentrant circuit, a part of which is injured and has decreased excitability (Figure 3A). Premature excitation (ex. premature contraction) arriving adjacent to injured tissue cannot excite the injured tissue, which has decreased excitability, but it can conduct to the other limb of the circuit. The product of refractory period and conduction velocity represents how far the excitation can travel through the circuit during the refractory period, and is referred as the wave length,

(A) Without anti‐arrhyhmic drugs. (B) Drugs that reduce excitability, such as class I drugs. (C) Drugs that delay conduction, such as class IC drugs. (D) Drugs that prolong refractory period, such as class III drugs.

Wave length = refractory period x conduction velocity

The difference between the actual length of the reentrant circuit and wave length calculated as above is referred to as the excitable gap.

Excitable gap = (length of reentrant circuit) − (wave length)

If the excitable gap is positive, when excitation traveling in a retrograde direction arrives at the injured tissue, the injured tissue is already out of the refractory period and can excite (unidirectional block), and thus reentry is established. The larger the excitable gap is, the more likely that reentry occurs. Conversely, the smaller the excitable gap is, the less likely reentry occurs. Class I drugs block Na+ channels, and thus suppress excitation conduction especially intensely in the injured region. In the case of the injured region losing excitability completely, excitation traveling in a retrograde direction is unable to excite the injured region (bidirectional block) and reentry is not established (Figure 3B). In the case of insufficient blockade of the Na+ channels, the excitability of the injured region remains and bidirectional block is not established. In this case, the excitable gap becomes larger due to shortening of the wave length caused by reduced conduction velocity, so that reentry is more likely to occur (Figure 3C). Class III drugs prolong the refractory period and increase the wave length. As a result, the excitable gap becomes smaller and reentry is less likely to occur. As class IA drugs affect both conduction velocity and refractory period, they can show both antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects depending on the magnitude of their effects on conduction velocity and refractory period.

Although the Sicilian Gambit was created mainly by the ESC, its recent antiarrhythmia guideline does not mention it. The heart is composed of a wide variety of cells.

 The types and amount of expressed ion channels, receptors and ion pumps differ considerably in each cell; for example, they differ between the atrium and the ventricle, between apex and base of the ventricles, and between the endocardial side and the epicardial side. Thus, no matter how precisely one analyzes the actions of drugs on ion channels, receptors and ion pumps in a certain cell type, one cannot comprehensively dictate their effects on the electrophysiology of the whole heart and on clinical arrhythmias. Current medical practice is grounded in evidence‐based medicine. The Sicilian Gambit did have an important role in establishing evidence for antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Nowadays, a simpler classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is preferable, such as the Vaughan Williams classification, together with guideline treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs based on clinical evidence.

Pharmacokinetics refers to how the body handles a drug, which involves absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME). After being administered, a drug reaches its site of action, binds to its receptor and exerts its pharmacological effects (Figure 4). By contrast, pharmacodynamics refers to how a drug affects the body; that is, the relationship between a drug binding to its receptor and its pharmacological action. How a drug exerts its effects is determined by its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.

Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination).

Drugs administered extravascularly must pass through several barriers before entering the blood circulation. Orally administered drugs are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, enter the portal vein and then, via the liver, enter the circulating bloodstream. The process during which administered drugs enter the blood circulation is called absorption, and it is affected by the biophysical and chemical properties of the drugs. The fraction of the administered dose that reaches systemic circulation intact is defined as its bioavailability.

Multidrug‐resistance 1 gene product (P‐glycoprotein) is expressed in the small intestine, blood‐brain barrier, hepatocyte, and renal proximal tuble, and pumps drugs out of cells. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are partly excreted into the gastrointestinal tract via P‐glycoprotein; therefore, their bioavailability and plasma concentration are increased when they are coadministered with P‐glycoprotein inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone, azole antifungal drugs, HIV protease inhibitors, etc.). Special caution should be exerted when dabigatran or edoxaban is coadministered with verapamil, quinidine or amiodarone: their doses should be lowered. On the other hand, when P‐glycoprotein inducers (rifampicin, carbamazepine, etc.) are coadministered, the expected pharmacological effects of DOACs may not be obtained due to decreased bioavailability and plasma concentration (Table 7).

Pharmacokinetic Profiles of DOACs and Warfarin (From Drug Interview Forms)

Abbreviations: CYP, cytochrome P450; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; GIT, gastrointestinal tract; P‐gp, P‐glycoprotein.

Following absorption, drugs distribute to a variety of organs and tissues. The volume of distribution (Vd) is the value obtained by dividing the total amount of the drug in the body by its plasma concentration. The Vd is calculated as the hypothetical value corresponding to the apparent volume in which the drug at the plasma concentration is evenly distributed. When the Vd is larger, more of the drug will be present in the extravascular tissue (i.e., it will more easily penetrate into the tissue from the blood). Among the antiarrhythmic drugs, digoxin and amiodarone have a large Vd. The Vd of digoxin is 8.4 L/kg, and it is mainly distributed to skeletal muscle, whereas the Vd of amiodarone is 106 L/kg, and it is mainly distributed to fat.

Drugs in the blood bind to plasma proteins, such as albumin and α‐acid glycoprotein. Only the drug in the unbound (free) form (unbound to the protein) can reach the site of action. Therefore, when the ratio between the protein‐bound and unbound (free) forms changes, the pharmacological effects of the drug can vary even if the total plasma concentration does not change. Especially in the case of high plasma protein‐bound drugs (>80%), their pharmacological effects may vary during hypoproteinemia and inflammation, which can affect their binding ratio to the plasma protein.

Drugs with high albumin binding, such as warfarin, will exert a stronger effect in hypoalbuminemia, which leads to an increase in the unbound (free) form of the drugs. By contrast, drugs with high α‐acid glycoprotein binding, such as lidocaine, disopyramide, propranolol and verapamil, will exert a weaker effect during inflammation, which leads to an increase in α‐acid glycoprotein, which in turn reduces the unbound (free) form of the drugs.

Many drugs undergo metabolism in 2 phases (phase I and phase II) to become more hydrophilic and to be excreted in the urine. The phase I reaction involves oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis, in which liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play important roles. The phase II reaction involves conjugation, which couples the drug to an endogenous molecule such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid or acetic acid. Each drug is metabolized differently. There are several CYP isoforms and different isoforms of CYP metabolize different types of drugs. Among the isoforms, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are mainly responsible for the metabolism of antiarrhythmic drugs

CYP2D6 deficiency is found in 5–10% of Caucasian individuals, but is rare in Japanese individuals (<1% of the population). However, approximately 40% of Japanese individuals have the mutant gene CYP2D6*10, with decreased enzyme activity.
25
 Additionally, CYP2D6 has a low enzymatic capacity, and its metabolic rate becomes constant at a relatively low substrate concentration (saturation). Therefore, drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, where the drug dose–plasma concentration is not proportional. Increasing the drug dose above certain level results in an increase in its plasma concentration larger than expected from linear pharmacokinetics. Examples of such drugs are aprindine, propafenone and bepridil (Table 8).
24

Ca2+ channel blockers, amiodarone and DOACs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban are metabolized by CYP3A4. Although CYP3A4 deficiency has not been reported, its enzymatic activity varies greatly among individuals. Because diltiazem inhibits CYP3A4 activity, the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrate drugs may increase when coadministered with diltiazem (Table 8).
24
 By contrast, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, etc. induce CYP3A4. Therefore, when coadministered with the CYP3A4 substrate drug, they may inhibit the pharmacological effects of the drug by reducing its plasma concentration
23
 (Table 8).
24

S‐warfarin is more potent than its enantiomer R‐warfarin and is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifungal drugs, uricosuric drugs, amiodarone etc. inhibit CYP2C9, whereas rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, bosentan, etc. induce CYP2C9. Therefore, the former drugs enhance and the latter drugs reduce the anticoagulant activity of S‐warfarin (Table 8).
24

Antiarrhythmic drugs are primarily excreted from the kidney and the liver. Glomerular filtration and tubular secretion are involved in renal excretion. Glomerular filtration is a passive process that excretes free‐form drugs of small size. By contrast, tubular secretion is an active process that involves organic anion (negative ion) and cation (positive ion) transport systems. Drugs such as procainamide and pilsicainide are excreted into the urine via the organic cation transport system.
26
 Digoxin is excreted into urine by the transporter P‐glycoprotein. Because P‐glycoprotein is inhibited by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, etc., renal excretion of digoxin is decreased when these drugs are coadministered, which leads to increased digoxin plasma concentration.
23
, 
27
 Pilsicainide, sotalol, digoxin, cibenzoline, etc. are antiarrhythmic drugs that are excreted highly unchanged in the urine (renal excretion‐type).

The dose of renally excreted drugs should be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction. In particular, drugs that are excreted unchanged by more than 70% in the urine are strongly affected by renal dysfunction. Renal function is estimated by the Cockcroft‐Gault equation (mL/min) or by the glomerular filtration ratio (GFR) equation for Japanese individuals (mL/min/1.73 m
2
) of the Japanese Society of Kidney Disease.

The Giusti‐Hayton method is a simple method of adjusting the drug dose in patients with renal dysfunction
28
 (Figure 5). However, because this method yields an estimation of the initial dose, blood drug concentration monitoring should be performed at steady state during repeated administration.

Dose adjustment for patients with renal dysfunction: the Giusti‐Hayton method.

Hepatic metabolism of drugs is affected by the severity of liver dysfunction and the metabolizing enzyme(s) involved. Liver metabolism by CYP2D6 is impaired in severe liver cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh class C),
29
 and liver metabolism by CYP3A4 is impaired in moderate and severe liver cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh classes B and C).
30

Drug‐metabolizing enzymes and renal function are underdeveloped in neonates, and drug elimination capacity per tissue volume or weight is lower in infancy, until approximately 2 years of age, than in later childhood. On the other hand, the weight of drug‐eliminating organs (liver and kidney) per body weight is larger during childhood (until adolescence) than in adulthood; therefore, the dose proportionally calculated by weight is too small in children.

The embryo at weeks 3–9 of gestation is absolutely susceptible to the teratogenic effects of any chemical agents. In addition, pregnant women have an increase in plasma volume, a decrease in plasma protein concentration, an increase in the GFR and increased activity of drug‐metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2D6, all of which should be taken into consideration when drugs are administered.
31

See Chapters XI (Arrhythmias in Pediatrics) and XII (Arrhythmias During Pregnancy) for details.

Because of the age‐related decline in physiological function, changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (susceptibility to drug effects) should be considered to ensure appropriate pharmacotherapy. Especially in elderly patients, because renal function is impaired, the clearance of renally excreted drugs decreases, and their elimination half‐life is prolonged.

For antiarrhythmic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Japan because the therapeutic ranges are narrow. Clinicians should refer to the “Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Cardiovascular Drugs: Clinical Use of Blood Drug Concentration Monitoring” (JCS 2015) for appropriate clinical usage and the interpretation of blood concentrations (Table 9).

When using an antiarrhythmic drug, it is necessary to expect side effects and regular laboratory tests or imaging should be scheduled for the prevention of side effects. The main side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs are described (Table 10).

Side Effects of Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Abbreviation: TdP, torsade de pointes.

Decreased Na+ influx due to the Na+ channel blocking effect of class I drugs causes an increase in Ca2+ efflux through the Na–Ca exchanger, resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. Therefore, class I drugs should not be used in heart failure patients.
32
 Class II drugs (β‐blockers) may decrease cardiac function and blood pressure, and induce bradycardia. Therefore, β‐blockers should be given in small doses and the dose adjusted by observing symptoms, blood pressure, chest X‐ray, and ECG. Class IV drugs (non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists [verapamil and diltiazem]) should also be withheld in patients with cardiac dysfunction because they suppress the intracellular Ca2+ influx.

An antiarrhythmic drug may exacerbate existing arrhythmias or provoke new arrhythmias, which is called a proarrhythmic effect. For example, class I drugs used for suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, increase the number of premature ventricular systoles, sustain ventricular tachycardia, and shorten the tachycardia cycle length. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) study, class IC drugs for the prevention of ventricular premature contractions increased the rate of sudden death compared with placebo.
15
, 
33
 The increased rate of sudden death is considered to be the result of the arrhythmogenic effect due to a decrease in conduction velocity with Na+ channel inhibition. Although class I drugs are often used for the termination and prevention of recurrence of atrial fibrillation, various arrhythmogenic effects may occur. The use of class IC drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation can cause it to change into atrial flutter because the excitation wavelength is prolonged due to lengthening of the refractory period.

The class I drugs with anticholinergic effects may cause atrial flutter with 1 : 1 conduction because of atrioventricular conduction enhancement. In this case, the heart rate is >300 beats/min and fatal, and thus sinus rhythm reversion or rate control must be promptly achieved. On the other hand, in atrial fibrillation associated with an accessory pathway syndrome, the use of digitalis, Ca2+ channel antagonists, and β‐blockers, which suppress atrioventricular conduction, facilitates conduction through the accessory pathway, thus increasing the ventricular rate. Not only does the tachycardia persist, but it may shift to ventricular fibrillation. The class I drugs may induce a Brugada‐type ECG or induce ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome. In patients with a cardiac pacemaker, pacing and sensing failure may occur because class I drugs reduce myocardial excitability. In addition, the class I drugs raise the defibrillation threshold, making electrical defibrillation difficult. In contrast, the class III drugs sotalol and nifekalant lower the defibrillation threshold.
34

The class IA and class III drugs are at risk of causing TdP due to prolongation of the QT interval with K+ channel suppression. It is well known that QT interval prolongation is more prominent in female patients, as well as patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and heart failure. Bradyarrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and atrioventricular block may occur with class I, II, and IV drugs. In digitalis intoxication, both bradyarrhythmias (sinoatrial block and atrioventricular block) and tachyarrhythmias (atrial tachycardia with block, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, etc.) can occur. Concomitant use of class II and class IV drugs should be avoided because of the excessive bradycardia.

In benign prostatic hyperplasia, class I drugs with anticholinergic effects (quinidine, disopyramide, cibenzoline, pirmenol) may lead to urinary retention. In angle‐closure glaucoma, these drugs may cause a rapid increase in the intraocular pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage. Class I drugs should be avoided in myasthenia gravis because they may worsen symptoms. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) used for terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia exacerbates bronchial asthma. Ca2+ channel blockers may induce lower extremity edema, and β‐blockers may cause general malaise, sleep disorders, bronchial asthma, a depressive tendency, and intermittent claudication. Disopyramide and cibenzoline may cause hypoglycemia in a dose‐dependent manner. Amiodarone has various extracardiac side effects, mainly thyroid dysfunction (hyperfunction and hypofunction), pulmonary complications (interstitial pneumonia, etc.), liver dysfunction, eye complications (optic neuritis), and dermatitis (photosensitivity). Of those, pulmonary complications are observed in approximately 3%,
35
 and the mortality rate is 5–10%.
36
 Pulmonary complications may occur within a few days after the initial administration, but in most cases, the risk increases over 12–60 months. Age, high maintenance doses, high blood levels of the active metabolite desethylamiodarone, and decreased lung diffusion before treatment are risk factors for this complication.
37
 Digoxin causes extracardiac side effects as the blood concentration increases. The main side effects are digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, etc.) central nervous system symptoms (confusion, blurred vision, yellowing, weakness, fatigue, headache, etc.), gynecomastia, and thrombocytopenia.
38

Blood tests for the early detection and follow‐up of side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs include liver and renal function tests, albumin, electrolytes (especially serum K+ and Ca2+), and B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The presence of structural disease and cardiac function should be checked by echocardiography. Physicians should be vigilant about monitoring the PR interval, RR interval, QRS width, and QT interval on the 12‐lead ECG. In addition to confirmation of the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on the Holter ECG, the presence of sinus arrest, atrioventricular block, and new arrhythmias should be checked. When administering amiodarone, thyroid function and the KL‐6 and surfactant protein‐A and ‐D levels should be checked. Lung auscultation, chest X‐rays, and chest CT are helpful for the early detection of pulmonary complications. In patients with heart failure, unexpected adverse events may occur because decreased organ blood flow and glomerular filtration rate affect the pharmacokinetics. To avoid any side effects of class I drugs and amiodarone, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is helpful.
31
 When digoxin is used in renal failure or dialysis patients, it is necessary to monitor the blood concentration frequently to adjust the dose or administration interval.

### Mechanisms of Arrhythmia Development (Abnormal Automaticity, Triggered Activity, and Reentry)

Electrophysiological mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmia are divided into 2 categories: (1) abnormal impulse generation and (2) abnormal impulse conduction. The former includes abnormalities in automaticity and triggered activity, and the latter includes reentry. This section is an overview of these arrhythmogenic mechanisms.

Automaticity is the ability of cardiac cells to undergo spontaneous slow diastolic depolarization and initiate an electrical impulse in the absence of external electrical stimulation.
6
 Normal automaticity occurs in a variety of cardiac tissues, including the sinoatrial node, some parts of the atria, pulmonary veins, the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the His–Purkinje system. Spontaneous depolarization is the result of the development of a net inward ionic current during the diastolic phase of the action potential (Figure 1A). Two mechanisms for spontaneous depolarization, which is referred to as a “clock”, are involved in spontaneous pacemaking: the membrane potential clock results from interactions of several sarcolemmal ion channels and transporters, and the Ca2+ clock is intracellular Ca2+ cycling mediated by sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and uptake. β
1‐adrenergic receptor stimulation by sympathetic nervous tone and catecholamines accelerates the intrinsic rate of automaticity by increasing the slope of the slow diastolic depolarization, whereas M2‐muscarinic receptor stimulation by parasympathetic nervous tone slows the intrinsic rate by decreasing the slope of the diastolic depolarization and hyperpolarizing the diastolic membrane potential.

Normal (A) and abnormal (B) automaticity, and triggered activities mediated by either early afterdepolarization (C) or delayed afterdepolarization (D).

Working myocardial cells in the atria and ventricles show abnormal automaticity when their resting membrane potential is partially depolarized (Figure 1B). The Ca2+ current, I
Ca, is responsible for the spontaneous action potential upstroke through the the mechanism of abnormal automaticity.
6
 In the acute phase of myocardial ischemia, extracellular K+ accumulation‐induced partial membrane depolarization may cause abnormal automaticity in ventricular cells and Purkinje fibers in the ischemic border zone.

Triggered activity is a term used to describe the initiation of electrical excitation from oscillatory afterdepolarizations that follow the action potential upstroke.
6
 Afterdepolarizations are classified into 2 groups: early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs).

EADs are oscillations in membrane potential during the plateau phase (phase 2) or repolarization phase (phase 3) of the action potential (Figure 1C), as a consequence of either an increase in depolarizing inward currents, including I
Ca, the late Na+ channel current, late I
Na and the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current I
NCX, or a decrease in the outward currents, including the transient outward current, I
to, the delayed rectifier K+ currents, I
Kr and I
Ks, and the inward‐rectifier K+ current, I
K1.
6
 The action potential plateau phase is especially vulnerable because the repolarizing and depolarizing currents are nearly balanced, and a small increase in the net inward current can cause prolongation of the action potential, inducing EADs. This type of EAD is believed to be the major trigger for torsades de pointes (TdPs)‐type polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with long QT syndromes. EADs may also contribute to arrhythmogenesis in the failing heart with electrical remodeling featuring action potential prolongation. Bradycardia and hypokalemia may facilitate this type of EAD by enhancing the prolongation of the action potential. EADs may occur during the repolarization phase of the action potential (phase 3 EADs) in cardiac myocytes with short action potentials (e.g., atrial and pulmonary vein myocardial cells). Phase 3 EADs are initiated by the Ca2+ transient during the action potential, which produces a large inward I
NCX at a negative membrane potential level during action potential repolarization.

DADs are oscillations in membrane potential after complete action potential repolarization under pathological conditions of Ca2+ overload

 (Figure 1D). Increased intracellular Ca2+ content can initiate spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which activates a transient inward current, I
ti. The inward I
NCX is the major component of I
ti. Factors inducing intracellular Ca2+ overload include catecholamines, digitalis, tachycardia, hypokalemia, and ischemia/reperfusion. Dysfunction of the ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels can also initiate spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release and induce DADs, which contributes to arrhythmogenic mechanisms in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Purkinje fibers are more susceptible to spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ release and DAD‐mediated triggered activity than ventricular cells.

A cardiac excitation wave may return to and re‐excite myocardial tissues that have been excited by the same excitation wave, and this phenomenon is referred to as reentry. Reentry can occur around a fixed anatomic obstacle, such as myocardial infarction scar or valve annulus, or through an anatomic circuit consisting of the normal AV conduction system and accessory pathways. Anatomic reentry is initiated by unidirectional conduction block and is maintained by the presence of an excitable gap between the reentrant wave front and its tail of refractoriness.

Reentry can be established around an area of functional conduction block without anatomic obstacles.

 Two theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism of functional reentry: (1) leading circle theory
9
 and (2) spiral wave reentry concept.

 (Figure 2C). Myocardial tissues with a preserved long action potential plateau can re‐excite tissues with highly abbreviated action potentials when these sites have been recovered from refractoriness.

### Classification and Mechanism of Action of Antiarrhythmic Drugs

The Vaughan Williams classification,
13
 which was publicized in 1969, classifies antiarrhythmic drugs into 4 classes. Originally, class I represented Na+ channel blockers, class II sympathetic β‐blockers, class III agents prolonging action potential duration (APD), and class IV Ca2+ channel blockers. Subsequently, class I was found to consist of drugs with various actions on ECG, and thus Harrison
14
 classified class I drugs into 3 subclasses. Class IA drugs prolong the PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval, class IB drugs shorten the QT interval without effects on the PR interval nor QRS duration, and class IC drugs prolong the PR interval and QRS duration without effects on the QT interval (Table 5). These differential effects on ECG parameters are caused by the rate of their binding to and dissociation from the Na+ channels. Class IB drugs have the fastest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus the drugs that bind to the channels during the systolic period are absent in the channels in the diastolic period, rendering no effects on the PR interval or QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IC drugs have the slowest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus these drugs are still bound to the channels when the diastolic period is over, causing prolongation of the PR interval and QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IA drugs are intermediate between these 2 classes of drugs. It has been shown that APD prolongation by class III drugs is caused by K+ channel blockade.
14
 QT interval prolongation by class IA drugs is caused by APD prolongation, which is also attributed to K+ channel blockade.

Vaughan Williams Classification

Abbreviation: APD, action potential duration.

Sudden death after myocardial infarction had been a serious social problem in Europe and the USA since the 1970s. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are indicators of sudden death, so class I drugs were prescribed to suppress PVCs without verified evidence they reduced the risk of sudden death. In 1989, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was performed to validate the efficacy of this strategy and the result was shocking: class I drugs flecainide and encainide even increased the incidence of sudden death after myocardial infarction.
15
 The result of CAST provoked the claim that the Vaughan Williams classification did not precisely represent the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) characterized the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on electrophysiology and electrocardiogram as the Principle of the Sicilian Gambit.
16
, 
17
 It characterized the effects of 22 antiarrhythmic drugs on ion channels, receptors, ion pumps, clinical actions and ECG
18
, 
19
 (Table 6). It is worth noting that digitalis, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and atropine that have been used against arrhythmias were newly classified as antiarrhythmic drugs in the Sicilian Gambit.

The actions of antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered based on their effects on electrophysiological parameters, such as refractory period, conduction, and excitability of cells. These are labeled as “vulnerable factors”. Let’s discuss the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs against reentrant arrhythmia with a certain length of reentrant circuit, a part of which is injured and has decreased excitability (Figure 3A). Premature excitation (ex. premature contraction) arriving adjacent to injured tissue cannot excite the injured tissue, which has decreased excitability, but it can conduct to the other limb of the circuit. The product of refractory period and conduction velocity represents how far the excitation can travel through the circuit during the refractory period, and is referred as the wave length,

The situation where early exciation (premature contraction) (vertical arrow) penetrates in the reentrant circuit (blue circle) in vicinity of damaged tissue (gray or black box). (A) Without anti‐arrhyhmic drugs. (B) Drugs that reduce excitability, such as class I drugs. (C) Drugs that delay conduction, such as class IC drugs. (D) Drugs that prolong refractory period, such as class III drugs.

Wave length = refractory period x conduction velocity

The difference between the actual length of the reentrant circuit and wave length calculated as above is referred to as the excitable gap.

Excitable gap = (length of reentrant circuit) − (wave length)

If the excitable gap is positive, when excitation traveling in a retrograde direction arrives at the injured tissue, the injured tissue is already out of the refractory period and can excite (unidirectional block), and thus reentry is established. The larger the excitable gap is, the more likely that reentry occurs. Conversely, the smaller the excitable gap is, the less likely reentry occurs. Class I drugs block Na+ channels, and thus suppress excitation conduction especially intensely in the injured region. In the case of the injured region losing excitability completely, excitation traveling in a retrograde direction is unable to excite the injured region (bidirectional block) and reentry is not established (Figure 3B). In the case of insufficient blockade of the Na+ channels, the excitability of the injured region remains and bidirectional block is not established. In this case, the excitable gap becomes larger due to shortening of the wave length caused by reduced conduction velocity, so that reentry is more likely to occur (Figure 3C). Class III drugs prolong the refractory period and increase the wave length. As a result, the excitable gap becomes smaller and reentry is less likely to occur. As class IA drugs affect both conduction velocity and refractory period, they can show both antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects depending on the magnitude of their effects on conduction velocity and refractory period.

Although the Sicilian Gambit was created mainly by the ESC, its recent antiarrhythmia guideline does not mention it. The heart is composed of a wide variety of cells.
20
, 
21
, 
22
 The types and amount of expressed ion channels, receptors and ion pumps differ considerably in each cell; for example, they differ between the atrium and the ventricle, between apex and base of the ventricles, and between the endocardial side and the epicardial side. Thus, no matter how precisely one analyzes the actions of drugs on ion channels, receptors and ion pumps in a certain cell type, one cannot comprehensively dictate their effects on the electrophysiology of the whole heart and on clinical arrhythmias. Current medical practice is grounded in evidence‐based medicine. The Sicilian Gambit did have an important role in establishing evidence for antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Nowadays, a simpler classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is preferable, such as the Vaughan Williams classification, together with guideline treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs based on clinical evidence.

These differential effects on ECG parameters are caused by the rate of their binding to and dissociation from the Na+ channels. Class IB drugs have the fastest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus the drugs that bind to the channels during the systolic period are absent in the channels in the diastolic period, rendering no effects on the PR interval or QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IC drugs have the slowest rate of binding to and dissociation from the channels, and thus these drugs are still bound to the channels when the diastolic period is over, causing prolongation of the PR interval and QRS duration during sinus rhythm. Class IA drugs are intermediate between these 2 classes of drugs. It has been shown that APD prolongation by class III drugs is caused by K+ channel blockade.

 QT interval prolongation by class IA drugs is caused by APD prolongation, which is also attributed to K+ channel blockade.

### Principle of Sicilian Gambit

Sudden death after myocardial infarction had been a serious social problem in Europe and the USA since the 1970s. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are indicators of sudden death, so class I drugs were prescribed to suppress PVCs without verified evidence they reduced the risk of sudden death. In 1989, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was performed to validate the efficacy of this strategy and the result was shocking: class I drugs flecainide and encainide even increased the incidence of sudden death after myocardial infarction.
15
 The result of CAST provoked the claim that the Vaughan Williams classification did not precisely represent the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) characterized the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on electrophysiology and electrocardiogram as the Principle of the Sicilian Gambit.

, 
17
 It characterized the effects of 22 antiarrhythmic drugs on ion channels, receptors, ion pumps, clinical actions and ECG

 (Table 6). It is worth noting that digitalis, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and atropine that have been used against arrhythmias were newly classified as antiarrhythmic drugs in the Sicilian Gambit.

### Mechanism Underlying the Actions of Antiarrhythmic Drugs

The actions of antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered based on their effects on electrophysiological parameters, such as refractory period, conduction, and excitability of cells. These are labeled as “vulnerable factors”. Let’s discuss the actions of antiarrhythmic drugs against reentrant arrhythmia with a certain length of reentrant circuit, a part of which is injured and has decreased excitability (Figure 3A). Premature excitation (ex. premature contraction) arriving adjacent to injured tissue cannot excite the injured tissue, which has decreased excitability, but it can conduct to the other limb of the circuit. The product of refractory period and conduction velocity represents how far the excitation can travel through the circuit during the refractory period, and is referred as the wave length,

Scheme for reentrant arrhythmia and effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. The situation where early exciation (premature contraction) (vertical arrow) penetrates in the reentrant circuit (blue circle) in vicinity of damaged tissue (gray or black box). (A) Without anti‐arrhyhmic drugs. (B) Drugs that reduce excitability, such as class I drugs. (C) Drugs that delay conduction, such as class IC drugs. (D) Drugs that prolong refractory period, such as class III drugs.

Wave length = refractory period x conduction velocity

The difference between the actual length of the reentrant circuit and wave length calculated as above is referred to as the excitable gap.

Excitable gap = (length of reentrant circuit) − (wave length)

If the excitable gap is positive, when excitation traveling in a retrograde direction arrives at the injured tissue, the injured tissue is already out of the refractory period and can excite (unidirectional block), and thus reentry is established. The larger the excitable gap is, the more likely that reentry occurs. Conversely, the smaller the excitable gap is, the less likely reentry occurs. Class I drugs block Na+ channels, and thus suppress excitation conduction especially intensely in the injured region. In the case of the injured region losing excitability completely, excitation traveling in a retrograde direction is unable to excite the injured region (bidirectional block) and reentry is not established (Figure 3B). In the case of insufficient blockade of the Na+ channels, the excitability of the injured region remains and bidirectional block is not established. In this case, the excitable gap becomes larger due to shortening of the wave length caused by reduced conduction velocity, so that reentry is more likely to occur (Figure 3C). Class III drugs prolong the refractory period and increase the wave length. As a result, the excitable gap becomes smaller and reentry is less likely to occur. As class IA drugs affect both conduction velocity and refractory period, they can show both antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects depending on the magnitude of their effects on conduction velocity and refractory period.

### Recent Consensus

Although the Sicilian Gambit was created mainly by the ESC, its recent antiarrhythmia guideline does not mention it. The heart is composed of a wide variety of cells.
20
, 
21
, 
22
 The types and amount of expressed ion channels, receptors and ion pumps differ considerably in each cell; for example, they differ between the atrium and the ventricle, between apex and base of the ventricles, and between the endocardial side and the epicardial side. Thus, no matter how precisely one analyzes the actions of drugs on ion channels, receptors and ion pumps in a certain cell type, one cannot comprehensively dictate their effects on the electrophysiology of the whole heart and on clinical arrhythmias. Current medical practice is grounded in evidence‐based medicine. The Sicilian Gambit did have an important role in establishing evidence for antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Nowadays, a simpler classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is preferable, such as the Vaughan Williams classification, together with guideline treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs based on clinical evidence.

### Pharmacokinetics (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination) and Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacokinetics refers to how the body handles a drug, which involves absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME). After being administered, a drug reaches its site of action, binds to its receptor and exerts its pharmacological effects (Figure 4). By contrast, pharmacodynamics refers to how a drug affects the body; that is, the relationship between a drug binding to its receptor and its pharmacological action. How a drug exerts its effects is determined by its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.

Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination).

Drugs administered extravascularly must pass through several barriers before entering the blood circulation. Orally administered drugs are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, enter the portal vein and then, via the liver, enter the circulating bloodstream. The process during which administered drugs enter the blood circulation is called absorption, and it is affected by the biophysical and chemical properties of the drugs. The fraction of the administered dose that reaches systemic circulation intact is defined as its bioavailability.

Multidrug‐resistance 1 gene product (P‐glycoprotein) is expressed in the small intestine, blood‐brain barrier, hepatocyte, and renal proximal tuble, and pumps drugs out of cells. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are partly excreted into the gastrointestinal tract via P‐glycoprotein; therefore, their bioavailability and plasma concentration are increased when they are coadministered with P‐glycoprotein inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone, azole antifungal drugs, HIV protease inhibitors, etc.). Special caution should be exerted when dabigatran or edoxaban is coadministered with verapamil, quinidine or amiodarone: their doses should be lowered. On the other hand, when P‐glycoprotein inducers (rifampicin, carbamazepine, etc.) are coadministered, the expected pharmacological effects of DOACs may not be obtained due to decreased bioavailability and plasma concentration (Table 7).

Pharmacokinetic Profiles of DOACs and Warfarin (From Drug Interview Forms)

Abbreviations: CYP, cytochrome P450; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; GIT, gastrointestinal tract; P‐gp, P‐glycoprotein.

Following absorption, drugs distribute to a variety of organs and tissues. The volume of distribution (Vd) is the value obtained by dividing the total amount of the drug in the body by its plasma concentration. The Vd is calculated as the hypothetical value corresponding to the apparent volume in which the drug at the plasma concentration is evenly distributed. When the Vd is larger, more of the drug will be present in the extravascular tissue (i.e., it will more easily penetrate into the tissue from the blood). Among the antiarrhythmic drugs, digoxin and amiodarone have a large Vd. The Vd of digoxin is 8.4 L/kg, and it is mainly distributed to skeletal muscle, whereas the Vd of amiodarone is 106 L/kg, and it is mainly distributed to fat.

Drugs in the blood bind to plasma proteins, such as albumin and α‐acid glycoprotein. Only the drug in the unbound (free) form (unbound to the protein) can reach the site of action. Therefore, when the ratio between the protein‐bound and unbound (free) forms changes, the pharmacological effects of the drug can vary even if the total plasma concentration does not change. Especially in the case of high plasma protein‐bound drugs (>80%), their pharmacological effects may vary during hypoproteinemia and inflammation, which can affect their binding ratio to the plasma protein.

Drugs with high albumin binding, such as warfarin, will exert a stronger effect in hypoalbuminemia, which leads to an increase in the unbound (free) form of the drugs. By contrast, drugs with high α‐acid glycoprotein binding, such as lidocaine, disopyramide, propranolol and verapamil, will exert a weaker effect during inflammation, which leads to an increase in α‐acid glycoprotein, which in turn reduces the unbound (free) form of the drugs.

Many drugs undergo metabolism in 2 phases (phase I and phase II) to become more hydrophilic and to be excreted in the urine. The phase I reaction involves oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis, in which liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play important roles. The phase II reaction involves conjugation, which couples the drug to an endogenous molecule such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid or acetic acid. Each drug is metabolized differently. There are several CYP isoforms and different isoforms of CYP metabolize different types of drugs. Among the isoforms, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are mainly responsible for the metabolism of antiarrhythmic drugs
23
 (Table 8).

 The following changes were made: bucolome, benzbromarone, azole antifungal drugs and cimetidine were added as CYP2C9 inhibitors; bosentan was added as a CYP2C9/3A4 inducer; rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban were added as CYP3A4 substrates.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are shown in red. CYP, cytochrome P450.

CYP2D6 deficiency is found in 5–10% of Caucasian individuals, but is rare in Japanese individuals (<1% of the population). However, approximately 40% of Japanese individuals have the mutant gene CYP2D6*10, with decreased enzyme activity.
25
 Additionally, CYP2D6 has a low enzymatic capacity, and its metabolic rate becomes constant at a relatively low substrate concentration (saturation). Therefore, drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics, where the drug dose–plasma concentration is not proportional. Increasing the drug dose above certain level results in an increase in its plasma concentration larger than expected from linear pharmacokinetics. Examples of such drugs are aprindine, propafenone and bepridil (Table 8).
24

Ca2+ channel blockers, amiodarone and DOACs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban are metabolized by CYP3A4. Although CYP3A4 deficiency has not been reported, its enzymatic activity varies greatly among individuals. Because diltiazem inhibits CYP3A4 activity, the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrate drugs may increase when coadministered with diltiazem (Table 8).
24
 By contrast, rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, etc. induce CYP3A4. Therefore, when coadministered with the CYP3A4 substrate drug, they may inhibit the pharmacological effects of the drug by reducing its plasma concentration
23
 (Table 8).
24

S‐warfarin is more potent than its enantiomer R‐warfarin and is metabolized mainly by CYP2C9. Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antifungal drugs, uricosuric drugs, amiodarone etc. inhibit CYP2C9, whereas rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, bosentan, etc. induce CYP2C9. Therefore, the former drugs enhance and the latter drugs reduce the anticoagulant activity of S‐warfarin (Table 8).
24

Antiarrhythmic drugs are primarily excreted from the kidney and the liver. Glomerular filtration and tubular secretion are involved in renal excretion. Glomerular filtration is a passive process that excretes free‐form drugs of small size. By contrast, tubular secretion is an active process that involves organic anion (negative ion) and cation (positive ion) transport systems. Drugs such as procainamide and pilsicainide are excreted into the urine via the organic cation transport system.
26
 Digoxin is excreted into urine by the transporter P‐glycoprotein. Because P‐glycoprotein is inhibited by quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, etc., renal excretion of digoxin is decreased when these drugs are coadministered, which leads to increased digoxin plasma concentration.
23
, 
27
 Pilsicainide, sotalol, digoxin, cibenzoline, etc. are antiarrhythmic drugs that are excreted highly unchanged in the urine (renal excretion‐type).

The dose of renally excreted drugs should be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction. In particular, drugs that are excreted unchanged by more than 70% in the urine are strongly affected by renal dysfunction. Renal function is estimated by the Cockcroft‐Gault equation (mL/min) or by the glomerular filtration ratio (GFR) equation for Japanese individuals (mL/min/1.73 m
2
) of the Japanese Society of Kidney Disease.

The Giusti‐Hayton method is a simple method of adjusting the drug dose in patients with renal dysfunction
28
 (Figure 5). However, because this method yields an estimation of the initial dose, blood drug concentration monitoring should be performed at steady state during repeated administration.

Dose adjustment for patients with renal dysfunction: the Giusti‐Hayton method.

Hepatic metabolism of drugs is affected by the severity of liver dysfunction and the metabolizing enzyme(s) involved. Liver metabolism by CYP2D6 is impaired in severe liver cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh class C),
29
 and liver metabolism by CYP3A4 is impaired in moderate and severe liver cirrhosis (Child‐Pugh classes B and C).
30

Drug‐metabolizing enzymes and renal function are underdeveloped in neonates, and drug elimination capacity per tissue volume or weight is lower in infancy, until approximately 2 years of age, than in later childhood. On the other hand, the weight of drug‐eliminating organs (liver and kidney) per body weight is larger during childhood (until adolescence) than in adulthood; therefore, the dose proportionally calculated by weight is too small in children.

The embryo at weeks 3–9 of gestation is absolutely susceptible to the teratogenic effects of any chemical agents. In addition, pregnant women have an increase in plasma volume, a decrease in plasma protein concentration, an increase in the GFR and increased activity of drug‐metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2D6, all of which should be taken into consideration when drugs are administered.
31

See Chapters XI (Arrhythmias in Pediatrics) and XII (Arrhythmias During Pregnancy) for details.

Because of the age‐related decline in physiological function, changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (susceptibility to drug effects) should be considered to ensure appropriate pharmacotherapy. Especially in elderly patients, because renal function is impaired, the clearance of renally excreted drugs decreases, and their elimination half‐life is prolonged.

For antiarrhythmic drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in Japan because the therapeutic ranges are narrow. Clinicians should refer to the “Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Cardiovascular Drugs: Clinical Use of Blood Drug Concentration Monitoring” (JCS 2015) for appropriate clinical usage and the interpretation of blood concentrations (Table 9).

### Side Effects of Antiarrhythmic Drugs and Countermeasures (Excluding Drug‐Induced Long QT Syndrome)

When using an antiarrhythmic drug, it is necessary to expect side effects and regular laboratory tests or imaging should be scheduled for the prevention of side effects. The main side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs are described (Table 10).

Side Effects of Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Abbreviation: TdP, torsade de pointes.

Decreased Na+ influx due to the Na+ channel blocking effect of class I drugs causes an increase in Ca2+ efflux through the Na–Ca exchanger, resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. Therefore, class I drugs should not be used in heart failure patients.
32
 Class II drugs (β‐blockers) may decrease cardiac function and blood pressure, and induce bradycardia. Therefore, β‐blockers should be given in small doses and the dose adjusted by observing symptoms, blood pressure, chest X‐ray, and ECG. Class IV drugs (non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists [verapamil and diltiazem]) should also be withheld in patients with cardiac dysfunction because they suppress the intracellular Ca2+ influx.

An antiarrhythmic drug may exacerbate existing arrhythmias or provoke new arrhythmias, which is called a proarrhythmic effect. For example, class I drugs used for suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, increase the number of premature ventricular systoles, sustain ventricular tachycardia, and shorten the tachycardia cycle length. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) study, class IC drugs for the prevention of ventricular premature contractions increased the rate of sudden death compared with placebo.
15
, 
33
 The increased rate of sudden death is considered to be the result of the arrhythmogenic effect due to a decrease in conduction velocity with Na+ channel inhibition. Although class I drugs are often used for the termination and prevention of recurrence of atrial fibrillation, various arrhythmogenic effects may occur. The use of class IC drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation can cause it to change into atrial flutter because the excitation wavelength is prolonged due to lengthening of the refractory period.

The class I drugs with anticholinergic effects may cause atrial flutter with 1 : 1 conduction because of atrioventricular conduction enhancement. In this case, the heart rate is >300 beats/min and fatal, and thus sinus rhythm reversion or rate control must be promptly achieved. On the other hand, in atrial fibrillation associated with an accessory pathway syndrome, the use of digitalis, Ca2+ channel antagonists, and β‐blockers, which suppress atrioventricular conduction, facilitates conduction through the accessory pathway, thus increasing the ventricular rate. Not only does the tachycardia persist, but it may shift to ventricular fibrillation. The class I drugs may induce a Brugada‐type ECG or induce ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome. In patients with a cardiac pacemaker, pacing and sensing failure may occur because class I drugs reduce myocardial excitability. In addition, the class I drugs raise the defibrillation threshold, making electrical defibrillation difficult. In contrast, the class III drugs sotalol and nifekalant lower the defibrillation threshold.
34

The class IA and class III drugs are at risk of causing TdP due to prolongation of the QT interval with K+ channel suppression. It is well known that QT interval prolongation is more prominent in female patients, as well as patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and heart failure. Bradyarrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and atrioventricular block may occur with class I, II, and IV drugs. In digitalis intoxication, both bradyarrhythmias (sinoatrial block and atrioventricular block) and tachyarrhythmias (atrial tachycardia with block, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, etc.) can occur. Concomitant use of class II and class IV drugs should be avoided because of the excessive bradycardia.

In benign prostatic hyperplasia, class I drugs with anticholinergic effects (quinidine, disopyramide, cibenzoline, pirmenol) may lead to urinary retention. In angle‐closure glaucoma, these drugs may cause a rapid increase in the intraocular pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage. Class I drugs should be avoided in myasthenia gravis because they may worsen symptoms. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) used for terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia exacerbates bronchial asthma. Ca2+ channel blockers may induce lower extremity edema, and β‐blockers may cause general malaise, sleep disorders, bronchial asthma, a depressive tendency, and intermittent claudication. Disopyramide and cibenzoline may cause hypoglycemia in a dose‐dependent manner. Amiodarone has various extracardiac side effects, mainly thyroid dysfunction (hyperfunction and hypofunction), pulmonary complications (interstitial pneumonia, etc.), liver dysfunction, eye complications (optic neuritis), and dermatitis (photosensitivity). Of those, pulmonary complications are observed in approximately 3%,
35
 and the mortality rate is 5–10%.
36
 Pulmonary complications may occur within a few days after the initial administration, but in most cases, the risk increases over 12–60 months. Age, high maintenance doses, high blood levels of the active metabolite desethylamiodarone, and decreased lung diffusion before treatment are risk factors for this complication.
37
 Digoxin causes extracardiac side effects as the blood concentration increases. The main side effects are digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, etc.) central nervous system symptoms (confusion, blurred vision, yellowing, weakness, fatigue, headache, etc.), gynecomastia, and thrombocytopenia.
38

Blood tests for the early detection and follow‐up of side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs include liver and renal function tests, albumin, electrolytes (especially serum K+ and Ca2+), and B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The presence of structural disease and cardiac function should be checked by echocardiography. Physicians should be vigilant about monitoring the PR interval, RR interval, QRS width, and QT interval on the 12‐lead ECG. In addition to confirmation of the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on the Holter ECG, the presence of sinus arrest, atrioventricular block, and new arrhythmias should be checked. When administering amiodarone, thyroid function and the KL‐6 and surfactant protein‐A and ‐D levels should be checked. Lung auscultation, chest X‐rays, and chest CT are helpful for the early detection of pulmonary complications. In patients with heart failure, unexpected adverse events may occur because decreased organ blood flow and glomerular filtration rate affect the pharmacokinetics. To avoid any side effects of class I drugs and amiodarone, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is helpful.
31
 When digoxin is used in renal failure or dialysis patients, it is necessary to monitor the blood concentration frequently to adjust the dose or administration interval.

### Heart Failure Due to Negative Inotropic Effect

Decreased Na+ influx due to the Na+ channel blocking effect of class I drugs causes an increase in Ca2+ efflux through the Na–Ca exchanger, resulting in decreased myocardial contractility. Therefore, class I drugs should not be used in heart failure patients.
32
 Class II drugs (β‐blockers) may decrease cardiac function and blood pressure, and induce bradycardia. Therefore, β‐blockers should be given in small doses and the dose adjusted by observing symptoms, blood pressure, chest X‐ray, and ECG. Class IV drugs (non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists [verapamil and diltiazem]) should also be withheld in patients with cardiac dysfunction because they suppress the intracellular Ca2+ influx.

### Proarrhythmic Effect

An antiarrhythmic drug may exacerbate existing arrhythmias or provoke new arrhythmias, which is called a proarrhythmic effect. For example, class I drugs used for suppressing ventricular arrhythmias, increase the number of premature ventricular systoles, sustain ventricular tachycardia, and shorten the tachycardia cycle length. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) study, class IC drugs for the prevention of ventricular premature contractions increased the rate of sudden death compared with placebo.
15
, 
33
 The increased rate of sudden death is considered to be the result of the arrhythmogenic effect due to a decrease in conduction velocity with Na+ channel inhibition. Although class I drugs are often used for the termination and prevention of recurrence of atrial fibrillation, various arrhythmogenic effects may occur. The use of class IC drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation can cause it to change into atrial flutter because the excitation wavelength is prolonged due to lengthening of the refractory period.

The class I drugs with anticholinergic effects may cause atrial flutter with 1 : 1 conduction because of atrioventricular conduction enhancement. In this case, the heart rate is >300 beats/min and fatal, and thus sinus rhythm reversion or rate control must be promptly achieved. On the other hand, in atrial fibrillation associated with an accessory pathway syndrome, the use of digitalis, Ca2+ channel antagonists, and β‐blockers, which suppress atrioventricular conduction, facilitates conduction through the accessory pathway, thus increasing the ventricular rate. Not only does the tachycardia persist, but it may shift to ventricular fibrillation. The class I drugs may induce a Brugada‐type ECG or induce ventricular fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome. In patients with a cardiac pacemaker, pacing and sensing failure may occur because class I drugs reduce myocardial excitability. In addition, the class I drugs raise the defibrillation threshold, making electrical defibrillation difficult. In contrast, the class III drugs sotalol and nifekalant lower the defibrillation threshold.
34

The class IA and class III drugs are at risk of causing TdP due to prolongation of the QT interval with K+ channel suppression. It is well known that QT interval prolongation is more prominent in female patients, as well as patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and heart failure. Bradyarrhythmias such as sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and atrioventricular block may occur with class I, II, and IV drugs. In digitalis intoxication, both bradyarrhythmias (sinoatrial block and atrioventricular block) and tachyarrhythmias (atrial tachycardia with block, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, etc.) can occur. Concomitant use of class II and class IV drugs should be avoided because of the excessive bradycardia.

### Extracardiac Side Effects

In benign prostatic hyperplasia, class I drugs with anticholinergic effects (quinidine, disopyramide, cibenzoline, pirmenol) may lead to urinary retention. In angle‐closure glaucoma, these drugs may cause a rapid increase in the intraocular pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage. Class I drugs should be avoided in myasthenia gravis because they may worsen symptoms. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) used for terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia exacerbates bronchial asthma. Ca2+ channel blockers may induce lower extremity edema, and β‐blockers may cause general malaise, sleep disorders, bronchial asthma, a depressive tendency, and intermittent claudication. Disopyramide and cibenzoline may cause hypoglycemia in a dose‐dependent manner. Amiodarone has various extracardiac side effects, mainly thyroid dysfunction (hyperfunction and hypofunction), pulmonary complications (interstitial pneumonia, etc.), liver dysfunction, eye complications (optic neuritis), and dermatitis (photosensitivity).

### BRADYARRHYTHMIAS

The rhythm of the heart is regulated by self‐firing action potentials originating from the sinus node propagating through the specialized conduction system that includes the atrioventricular node (AVN), His‐bundle, right and left bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers. Dysfunction of the sinus node or AVN and the distal conduction system leads to the bradyarrhythmias called sick sinus syndrome (sinus node dysfunction) and atrioventricular block, respectively.

Bradyarrhythmias suddenly develop long pauses, which result in transient brain ischemia leading to dizziness, light headedness, and syncope (i.e., Adams‐Stokes attack). The diagnosis may be difficult when the symptoms are transient and infrequent. Patients with type III sick sinus syndrome often have preceding palpitation due to tachyarrhythmias, typically atrial fibrillation. Symptomatic heart failure can result from chronotropic incompetence with sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. Some patients with bradyarrhythmias are asymptomatic.

No treatment is required for individuals with asymptomatic bradycardia, such as athletes with sinus bradycardia and those with Wenckebach‐type 2nd‐degree atrioventricular block. Pacemaker implantation is indicated for patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias.

Bradyarrhythmias with a reversible cause due to drugs, hyperkalemia etc., should be treated to eliminate those influences, in combination with a temporary pacemaker if necessary. Right ventricular pacing using a transvenous lead is a standard technique for temporary pacing. In an emergency, percutaneous pacing using external patch electrodes is also performed. Pharmacological therapy, especially with intravenous drugs, can be a bridging method for temporary pacing as well as a permanent pacemaker implant. The patient’s preference and severity of illness may lead to selection of pharmacological therapy even if pacemaker implantation is preferable for managing the hemodynamic instability with bradyarrhythmias. Oral medications may be used in patients with infrequent or undetected bradycardia whose symptoms are mild.

The class of recommendation and level of evidence regarding pharmacological therapy for bradyarrhythmias are summarized in Table 11.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Pharmacological Therapy for Bradycardia Attributable to Sinus Node Dysfunction or Atrioventricular Block

*Use of theophylline and cilostazol for bradyarrhythmias cannot be reimbursed by healthcare insurance.

Abbreviations: COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Atropine is used for vagal bradycardia. The initial dose for intravenous administration of atropine is 0.5 mg, and it can be given repeatedly in the case of persistent bradycardia. Atropine activates the atrio‐Hisian or intranodal conduction of AVN, and is effective for AVN block (AH block: the site of the block is the AVN). Self‐firing of the sinus node is also activated by atropine, thereby increasing the rate of atrial contraction. With the increase, the ratio of atrioventricular conduction can deteriorate, such that the heart rate may be decreased in patients with HV (His bundle to ventricular) block (the site of the block is intra‐ or infra‐Hisian).

Intravenous administration of isoproterenol at a dose of 0.01–0.03 μg/kg/min is used in emergency or as an alternative method of temporary pacing. Adrenaline (2–10 μg/min) or dopamine (2–10 μg/kg/min) is also recommended in the case of atropine resistance.
49

Intravenous or oral administration of theophylline is reported to be useful for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias attributable to sick sinus syndrome or atrioventricular block.
39
, 
40
, 
41
, 
42
 Theophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase activity and is a competitive blocker of adenosine receptors. Therefore, theophylline is expected to antagonize adenosine‐related bradyarrhythmias in which adenosine reduces the excitability of both the sinus node and AVN through activation of the acetylcholine/adenosine‐regulated K+ (I
K, ACh) channel. Adenosine is an endogenous metabolite that accumulates in the interstitium during myocardial ischemia. In this regard, slow injection of aminophylline (theophylline with ethylenediamine: 150–300 mg over 15 min) reverses the atropine‐resistant complete atrioventricular block in the early phase of acute inferior myocardial infarction and restores sinus rhythm with 1 : 1 atrioventricular conduction (1st‐degree atrioventricular block).
45
, 
46
, 
47
, 
48

A group of patients (mean age 55 ± 19 years) with recurrent syncope and idiopathic paroxysmal atrioventricular block has been characterized by low plasma adenosine level and high susceptibility to exogenous and endogenous adenosine.
50
 Oral theophylline is reported to be effective in these patients.
50
, 
51
, 
52
 The dose of theophylline is >600 mg daily in the USA and Europe,
39
, 
52
 but 200–400 mg daily in Japan.
42
 The cost of theophylline for bradyarrhythmias is not applicable for healthcare insurance reimbursement.

Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases the level of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. cAMP‐dependent activation of the L‐type Ca2+ channel current (I
Ca, L) and pacemaker current (I
f) in the sinus node contributes to an increase in the heart rate, hence cilostazol can have a positive chronotropic effect.

Oral daily administration of 200 mg of cilostazol in patients with sick sinus syndrome increased the mean heart rate from 54 beats/min to 79 beats/min and shortened the mean maximal RR interval from 2.98 s to 1.96 s.
43
 In patients with complete atrioventricular block and symptomatic heart failure, oral cilostazol 200 mg daily increases the rate of ventricular escape rhythm and reduces the level of B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
44
 Cilostazol increases the heart rate of patients with bradycardiac atrial fibrillation.

 Similar to theophylline, the cost of cilostazol is not applicable for healthcare insurance reimbursement.

Supraventricular premature contractions (SVPCs) are defined as premature contractions that occur in the atrium or at atrioventricular junction. SVPCs occur even in healthy subjects and the incidence increases with aging. SVPCs do not cause hemodynamic disorders and have a good prognosis. Hoever, the relationship between SVPCs and future AF has been drawing attention lately.

More than 90% of healthy people have SVPCs, and most people have less than 100 beats/day.
55
 Up to about 100 beats/day of SVPCs can be considered normal.

SVPC may increase with caffeine, alcohol, stress, fatigue, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc. SVPCs have little effect on symptoms and hemodynamics, and rarely require treatment. However, SVPCs >100 beats/day is a predictor of new‐onset AF in general population without apparent organic heart disease.
56

SVPCs detected during a health examination are associated with more cases of AF and cardiovascular death.
57
, 
58
 A meta‐analysis revealed that SVPCs are related with stroke, all‐cause death, cardiovascular disease, and coronary artery disease,
59
 but treatment of SVPCs is not recommended due to the low absolute risk, despite the significant hazard ratio.

Cerebral infarction is classified into cardiogenic cerebral embolism, lacunar infarction, atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, etc. depending on the cause. Strokes of unknown cause account for 20–25% of the whole and are called cryptogenic strokes. Most of them are thought to be embolic and are termed embolic stroke of unknown sources (ESUS). SVPCs are clinically important in cases of ESUS. The more SVPCs the patient with ESUS has, the more episodes of AF are detected during long‐term ECG monitoring.
60
, 
61
 For example, ≈40% of patients with ≥1,000 SVPCs/day develop new AF, which should be taken into consideration in determining the indication for anticoagulant therapy after cerebral infarction.
60

Table 12 show the recommendations for lifestyle and pharmacological treatment, and the levels of evidence for treatment of SVPCs.
15
 It usually requires no treatment, but treatment is considered when SVPCs impair quality of life (QOL); however, the balance between safety and necessity should be considered carefully. It is important to educate patients about the low risk of SVPCs and lifestyle effects such as caffeine and alcohol intake. β‐blockers are sometimes recommended, especially for SVPCs that increase during the day.
62
 Class I antiarrhythmic drugs other than mexiletine (e.g., aprindine, cibenzoline, pilsicainide, propafenone and flecainide) can be used in patients without organic heart disease.

Recommendations of Lifestyle and Pharmacological Treatment, and Levels of Evidence for the Treatment of SVPCs

Abbreviation: COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; SVPC, supraventricular premature contraction.

Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are not recommended for patients with prior myocardial infarction or cardiac dysfunction because they may worsen the prognosis.
15

Lifestyle changes and/or mild tranquillizers are sufficient to treat patients with mild symptoms of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). However, PVCs are known to trigger severe arrhythmia,
63
 and cardiac function sometimes declines in patients with frequent PVCs.
64
 Therefore, risk assessment is important in patients with PVCs.

Evaluation of organic heart disease, cardiac function, type of arrhythmia (frequency of arrhythmia, timing of occurrence, presence/absence of couplets, triplets, and short runs, among other such parameters), and family history of hereditary arrhythmias is necessary to estimate the risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. The Lown classification,
65
 which is based on the risk of onset of PVCs after myocardial infarction, was proposed before the era of currently available reperfusion treatment, but for practical purposes and convenience, it is applied to patients with PVCs under conditions other than myocardial infarction. The frequency of monomorphic PVCs is >30/h, and polymorphic, triplets, and short‐run, R‐on‐T type, and those with a short coupling interval are at high risk.

Reportedly, increased PVCs during exercise stress testing,
66
 and multiple episodes of PVCs during recovery after exercise are considered risk factors.
67
 Patients with ≥10,000 (≥10%) of PVCs/day, QRS width ≥150 ms,
68
, 
69
 and PVCs recorded throughout the day
70
 are at risk of PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy. However, the above factors of cardiomyopathy have low sensitivity and specificity. Reportedly, patients showing PVCs with short coupling intervals or high pulmonary wedge pressure concomitant with the PVCs are considered high‐risk patients.
71
, 
72

PVCs without organic heart disease usually have a good prognosis. Antiarrhythmic drugs should not be administered to patients with minimal symptoms. Treatment with β‐blockers and Ca2+ channel antagonists is considered for patients with symptoms and frequent and/or multifocal PVCs;
73
, 
74
 however, the effect is limited.
75
, 
76
 Although amiodarone, sotalol, and some class I antiarrhythmic drugs effectively suppress arrhythmias, their proarrhythmic and other adverse effects should also be considered.

The right ventricular outflow tract is the most common site of origin of PVCs, although they also originate in the left ventricular outflow tract and atrioventricular valve annulus. In most cases, the contributory mechanism includes triggered activity by intracellular Ca overload. β‐blockers, Ca2+ channel antagonists, and class I antiarrhythmic are recommended in patients with severe symptoms.
76
 Catheter ablation is considered in patients refractory to drug treatment.
4

Notably, 5–10% of idiopathic PVCs originate in the anterior or posterior papillary muscles of the left ventricle, and are of the non‐reentrant type showing a right bundle branch block pattern. β‐blockers are used in such cases, depending on symptoms and frequency of the arrhythmia.

This entity often shows a right bundle branch block and left axis deviation pattern. Reentry in Ca‐dependent tissue in the area supplied by the posterior branch of the left bundle branch or triggered activity from the Purkinje fibers is the likely contributory mechanism for this abnormality. Ca2+ channel antagonists, β‐blockers, and Na+ channel blockers (aprindine and mexiletine) are first choice.

Treatment is warranted for patients with severe subjective symptoms secondary to arrhythmia or in patients with several PVCs (≥10% of the total heart beats). Patients with highly frequent PVCs show improved cardiac function following a decrease in PVCs,
77
, 
78
 and β‐blockers, amiodarone, and mexiletine are preferred in such cases. Patients included in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial showed worse prognosis after the administration of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs following myocardial infarction.
33
 Consequently, class IC antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated in patients with organic heart disease or in those with diminished cardiac function. In principle, class IA antiarrhythmic drugs are also contraindicated in this patient population. The type and origin of arrhythmia, indicated by the coupling interval and the presence or absence of couplets, triplets, and short‐run PVCs should be considered for patient selection prior to implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator placement or ablation in those with diminished cardiac function and/or organic heart disease. Table 13 shows the recommendations and levels of evidence for drug therapy in patients with PVCs.

The mechanisms of PVCs associated with ischemic heart disease include reentry, abnormal automaticity, and triggered activity.

β‐blockers are recommended for the prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in acute coronary syndromes, particularly in patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction.
82
 Prophylactic amiodarone or lidocaine administration is not recommended.
82
, 
83
 PVCs and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) secondary to reperfusion injury may occur during treatment of coronary artery disease. Multiple PVCs and short runs may occur before the onset of ventricular fibrillation, and amiodarone, lidocaine, nifekalant, and procainamide are useful in these patients.

Amiodarone,
84
, 
85
 mexiletine, and sotalol are preferable in these patients.
86

87
 Notably, classes IA and IC antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.

Patients with diminished cardiac function receive standard treatment for heart failure. Multiple PVCs are high risk. β‐blockers, amiodarone, and mexiletine are used in some patients. Reportedly, β‐blockers and amiodarone improve cardiac function in some patients with heart failure and concomitant frequent PVCs.

### Cilostazol

Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases the level of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. cAMP‐dependent activation of the L‐type Ca2+ channel current (I
Ca, L) and pacemaker current (I
f) in the sinus node contributes to an increase in the heart rate, hence cilostazol can have a positive chronotropic effect.

Oral daily administration of 200 mg of cilostazol in patients with sick sinus syndrome increased the mean heart rate from 54 beats/min to 79 beats/min and shortened the mean maximal RR interval from 2.98 s to 1.96 s.
43
 In patients with complete atrioventricular block and symptomatic heart failure, oral cilostazol 200 mg daily increases the rate of ventricular escape rhythm and reduces the level of B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP).
44
 Cilostazol increases the heart rate of patients with bradycardiac atrial fibrillation.

 Similar to theophylline, the cost of cilostazol is not applicable for healthcare insurance reimbursement.

### PREMATURE CONTRACTIONS

Supraventricular premature contractions (SVPCs) are defined as premature contractions that occur in the atrium or at atrioventricular junction. SVPCs occur even in healthy subjects and the incidence increases with aging. SVPCs do not cause hemodynamic disorders and have a good prognosis. Hoever, the relationship between SVPCs and future AF has been drawing attention lately.

More than 90% of healthy people have SVPCs, and most people have less than 100 beats/day.
55
 Up to about 100 beats/day of SVPCs can be considered normal.

SVPC may increase with caffeine, alcohol, stress, fatigue, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, etc. SVPCs have little effect on symptoms and hemodynamics, and rarely require treatment. However, SVPCs >100 beats/day is a predictor of new‐onset AF in general population without apparent organic heart disease.
56

SVPCs detected during a health examination are associated with more cases of AF and cardiovascular death.
57
, 
58
 A meta‐analysis revealed that SVPCs are related with stroke, all‐cause death, cardiovascular disease, and coronary artery disease,
59
 but treatment of SVPCs is not recommended due to the low absolute risk, despite the significant hazard ratio.

Cerebral infarction is classified into cardiogenic cerebral embolism, lacunar infarction, atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, etc. depending on the cause. Strokes of unknown cause account for 20–25% of the whole and are called cryptogenic strokes. Most of them are thought to be embolic and are termed embolic stroke of unknown sources (ESUS). SVPCs are clinically important in cases of ESUS. The more SVPCs the patient with ESUS has, the more episodes of AF are detected during long‐term ECG monitoring.
60
, 
61
 For example, ≈40% of patients with ≥1,000 SVPCs/day develop new AF, which should be taken into consideration in determining the indication for anticoagulant therapy after cerebral infarction.

15
 It usually requires no treatment, but treatment is considered when SVPCs impair quality of life (QOL); however, the balance between safety and necessity should be considered carefully. It is important to educate patients about the low risk of SVPCs and lifestyle effects such as caffeine and alcohol intake. β‐blockers are sometimes recommended, especially for SVPCs that increase during the day.
62
 Class I antiarrhythmic drugs other than mexiletine (e.g., aprindine, cibenzoline, pilsicainide, propafenone and flecainide) can be used in patients without organic heart disease.

### Premature Ventricular Contractions

Lifestyle changes and/or mild tranquillizers are sufficient to treat patients with mild symptoms of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). However, PVCs are known to trigger severe arrhythmia,
63
 and cardiac function sometimes declines in patients with frequent PVCs.
64
 Therefore, risk assessment is important in patients with PVCs.

Evaluation of organic heart disease, cardiac function, type of arrhythmia (frequency of arrhythmia, timing of occurrence, presence/absence of couplets, triplets, and short runs, among other such parameters), and family history of hereditary arrhythmias is necessary to estimate the risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death. The Lown classification,
65
 which is based on the risk of onset of PVCs after myocardial infarction, was proposed before the era of currently available reperfusion treatment, but for practical purposes and convenience, it is applied to patients with PVCs under conditions other than myocardial infarction. The frequency of monomorphic PVCs is >30/h, and polymorphic, triplets, and short‐run, R‐on‐T type, and those with a short coupling interval are at high risk.

Reportedly, increased PVCs during exercise stress testing,
66
 and multiple episodes of PVCs during recovery after exercise are considered risk factors.
67
 Patients with ≥10,000 (≥10%) of PVCs/day, QRS width ≥150 ms,
68
, 
69
 and PVCs recorded throughout the day
70
 are at risk of PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy. However, the above factors of cardiomyopathy have low sensitivity and specificity. Reportedly, patients showing PVCs with short coupling intervals or high pulmonary wedge pressure concomitant with the PVCs are considered high‐risk patients.
71
, 
72

PVCs without organic heart disease usually have a good prognosis. Antiarrhythmic drugs should not be administered to patients with minimal symptoms. Treatment with β‐blockers and Ca2+ channel antagonists is considered for patients with symptoms and frequent and/or multifocal PVCs;
73
, 
74
 however, the effect is limited.
75
, 
76
 Although amiodarone, sotalol, and some class I antiarrhythmic drugs effectively suppress arrhythmias, their proarrhythmic and other adverse effects should also be considered.

The right ventricular outflow tract is the most common site of origin of PVCs, although they also originate in the left ventricular outflow tract and atrioventricular valve annulus. In most cases, the contributory mechanism includes triggered activity by intracellular Ca overload. β‐blockers, Ca2+ channel antagonists, and class I antiarrhythmic are recommended in patients with severe symptoms.
76
 Catheter ablation is considered in patients refractory to drug treatment.
4

Notably, 5–10% of idiopathic PVCs originate in the anterior or posterior papillary muscles of the left ventricle, and are of the non‐reentrant type showing a right bundle branch block pattern. β‐blockers are used in such cases, depending on symptoms and frequency of the arrhythmia.

This entity often shows a right bundle branch block and left axis deviation pattern. Reentry in Ca‐dependent tissue in the area supplied by the posterior branch of the left bundle branch or triggered activity from the Purkinje fibers is the likely contributory mechanism for this abnormality. Ca2+ channel antagonists, β‐blockers, and Na+ channel blockers (aprindine and mexiletine) are first choice.

### Fascicular Premature Ventricular Contractions

This entity often shows a right bundle branch block and left axis deviation pattern. Reentry in Ca‐dependent tissue in the area supplied by the posterior branch of the left bundle branch or triggered activity from the Purkinje fibers is the likely contributory mechanism for this abnormality. Ca2+ channel antagonists, β‐blockers, and Na+ channel blockers (aprindine and mexiletine) are first choice.

### Premature Ventricular Contractions Associated With Organic Heart Disease

Treatment is warranted for patients with severe subjective symptoms secondary to arrhythmia or in patients with several PVCs (≥10% of the total heart beats). Patients with highly frequent PVCs show improved cardiac function following a decrease in PVCs,
77
, 
78
 and β‐blockers, amiodarone, and mexiletine are preferred in such cases. Patients included in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial showed worse prognosis after the administration of class IC antiarrhythmic drugs following myocardial infarction.
33
 Consequently, class IC antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated in patients with organic heart disease or in those with diminished cardiac function. In principle, class IA antiarrhythmic drugs are also contraindicated in this patient population. The type and origin of arrhythmia, indicated by the coupling interval and the presence or absence of couplets, triplets, and short‐run PVCs should be considered for patient selection prior to implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator placement or ablation in those with diminished cardiac function and/or organic heart disease. Table 13 shows the recommendations and levels of evidence for drug therapy in patients with PVCs.

### PAROXYSMAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRANT TACHYCARDIA, ATRIOVENTRICULAR RECIPROCATING TACHYCARDIA, ATYPICAL SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIAS)

The recommendation and evidence level for differential diagnosis of narrow QRS tachycardia using a drug are shown in Table 14.

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Differential Diagnosis of Narrow QRS Tachycardia Using ATP

Not covered by medical insurance, contraindicated for asthmatic patients.

Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the drugs that have been reported to inhibit atrioventricular nodular (AVN) conduction. It is effective for stopping narrow QRS tachycardia, as well as for making a differential diagnosis of atrial tachycardia and sinus tachycardia. A definitive differential diagnosis can be made between QRS and atrial or sinus tachycardia depending on whether the P wave remains constant after suppressing AVN conduction. If the tachycardia is controlled by drugs that suppress AVN conduction by the atrial wave (retrograde P wave), then orthodromic AVRT or AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is suspected. Atrial tachycardia and other AVN‐dependent supraventricular tachycardias are among those that terminate in the ventricular wave (QRS wave); therefore, it is difficult to differentiate them by ECG waveform alone.

Intravenous ATP, verapamil, and β‐blockers all selectively delay conduction of the AVN. Because ATP has an extremely short half‐life, it is often used in making a differential diagnosis and stopping supraventricular arrhythmia, and is administered in a rapid intravenous injection.
88
, 
89
 Because ATP also has the effect of suppressing the sinus node, it should be cautiously administered to patients with sick sinus syndrome.

Group I antiarrhythmic agents suppress AVN conduction, but also act on accessory pathways in atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate AVRT from ectopic atrial tachycardia by 12‐lead ECG alone, because it also suppresses ectopic automaticity. The start and maintenance of AVNRT are associated with the balance between the AVN refractory period and the conduction velocity, and drugs that affect such characteristics can affect the start or maintenance of the arrhythmia. To stop tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs of the class IA group (e.g., procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide)
90
, 
91
, 
92
, 
93
 or IC group (e.g., flecainide, propafenone)
94
 block retrograde fast pathway conduction. In constrast, atropine and isoproterenol facilitate retrograde fast pathway or orthodromic slow pathway conduction and the induction of AVNRT.
95
, 
96
, 
97

Differential diagnoses for regular narrow QRS with long RP’ tachycardia and clear retrograde P wave (II, III, aVF, and negative P wave) observed with RP interval > PR interval include ectopic atrial tachycardia, uncommon (fast‐slow) AVNRT, and permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT).
98
 The latter two recur easily even if they are terminated and are often drug‐resistant. PJRT, as with orthodromic AVRT, is caused by a macrorentrant circuit.
99
, 
100
 However, the latent accessory pathway in this circuit is atypical; that is, it has conduction properties like the AVN, and has a long retrograde conduction time. This type of tachycardia responds to autonomic tone, catecholamines, β‐blockers, and digoxin.

Acute management of narrow QRS supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) begins with hemodynamic assessment. The majority of SVT patients exhibit an initial decrease in blood pressure, followed by a gradual recovery within 30 s.
101
 Although it is rare, sinus rhythm must be promptly restored by direct‐current synchronized cardioversion in patients with hemodynamic compromise (Figure 6, Table 15).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Treatment of Narrow QRS SVT*1

*1In patients with wide QRS SVT due to antidromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, i.v. ATP, verapamil, diltiazem or β‐blocker should be avoided, but i.v. class I antiarrhythmic drugs are recommended (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence C, MINDS grade of recommendation C1, MINDS level of evidence V). *2Off‐label use in Japan. *3Class of recommendation of i.v. verapamil or diltiazem is IIb in patients with SVT who have ventricular pre‐excitation during sinus rhythm. *4Contraindication in patients with a reduced left ventricular function.

Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

In hemodynamically stable patients, vagal maneuvers are the first‐line intervention to terminate SVT.
102
, 
103
, 
104
 There are several techniques used to increase vagal parasympathetic tone, including the Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage. The Valsalva maneuver is performed by forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway to raise intrathoracic pressure for 10–30 s. An increase in vagal tone occurs after releasing the Valsalva strain. It has recently been reported that leg lifting immediately at the end of the Valsalva strain enhances the vagal effect.
102
 Carotid massage is performed after the absence of bruit is confirmed by auscultation, by applying steady pressure over the right carotid sinus for 5–10 s. When right carotid massage is ineffective, left carotid massage is worth attempting. Because success in terminating SVT with vagal maneuvers depends on the physician’s skills and experience, pharmacological treatments are sometimes preferred as first‐line therapy.

If vagal maneuvers fail or are not attempted, an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the drug of choice (off‐label use in Japan).
105
, 
106
, 
107
 When administered intravenously, ATP is rapidly dephosphorylated into adenosine, which suppresses the atrioventricular node (AVN), resulting in termination of AVN‐dependent tachycardias such as AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). The initial dose of ATP is 5–10 mg. If SVT persists, ATP administration can be repeated up to a maximum of 20 mg (high‐dose ATP should be used with caution because severe bradycardia occurs more frequently). Because the half‐life of ATP is extremely short (<10 s), a 10–20 mL flush of normal saline must follow the ATP injection when administered from a peripheral vein for ATP to reach the heart. Rapid intravenous ATP injection often results in unpleasant but transient side effects (flushing, chest discomfort, and headache, etc.). Thus, patients should be informed about such side effects before injection. ATP should be avoided in patients with bronchial asthma because of the bronchospastic effect of ATP.

When SVT does not respond to ATP or recurs immediately after termination with ATP, intravenous infusion of Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil 5 mg or diltiazem 10 mg) given over 5 min is the next treatment of choice. Ca2+ channel blockers suppress the AVN similar to ATP but are longer acting than ATP. Success rates of ATP and Ca2+ channel blockers for SVT termination range from 80% to 95%.
105
, 
106
, 
108
 Ca2+ channel blockers should be avoided in patients with heart failure, because it is associated with a risk of hemodynamic deterioration.

When SVT does not respond to these treatments, AVN‐independent atrial tachycardia (AT) is the likely mechanism and intravenous class I antiarrhythmic drugs may be effective. Intravenous amiodarone can be considered in patients with a reduced left ventricular function (off‐label use in Japan).

If episodes of SVT are infrequent, a self‐administered single‐dose oral drug treatment might be useful. However, the usefulness of oral verapamil monotherapy has not been proven.
109
 The combination of oral diltiazem and propranolol appears effective in terminating AVN‐dependent tachycardias (e.g., AVNRT and AVRT), but the overall safety of these medications remains unclear because syncope has been reported as an adverse event.
110

In patients with wide QRS SVT due to antidromic AVRT, AVN‐suppressing drugs should be avoided. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide or flecainide are the first treatment of choice for terminating antidromic AVRT.

If the episodes of SVT are short and self‐limited, prophylactic therapy is not necessarily needed.
111
 When the SVT episodes are long enough to require acute management, catheter ablation is recommended as a first‐line prophylactic therapy that can provide a definitive cure with a high success rate (≥90%) and favorable safety profile.
112
, 
113
 Pharmacological treatments are indicated as prophylactic therapy in patients who are unwilling to undergo catheter ablation or have an unsuccessful catheter ablation (Figure 7, Table 16).

Oral verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers reduce the frequency and duration of SVT episodes, and are the treatment of choice for pharmacological prophylactic therapy in the majority of patients with SVT who do not have ventricular pre‐excitation during sinus rhythm.
114
, 
115
, 
116
, 
117
 Patients with ventricular pre‐excitation may develop atrial fibrillation during SVT and be exposed to increased risk of ventricular fibrillation by accelerating conduction over the accessory pathway while receiving verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers, so these drugs must be used with caution even when the ventricular pre‐excitation is intermittent. Also, oral verapamil and diltiazem should be avoided in patients with reduced left ventricular function because they can be harmful through their negative inotropic effect.

If oral verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, oral class I antiarrhythmic drugs can be effective. A wide variety of class I antiarrhythmic drugs are available in Japan. The effectiveness and safety of oral flecainide or propafenone, which can be used in Western countries, have been well studied.
114

121
 disopyramide,
122
 cibenzoline,
123
 aprindine,
124
 and pilsicainide, appear to have similar effectiveness, although the evidence is limited. Disopyramide, cibenzoline, pilsicainide, flecainide, and propafenone have a negative inotropic effect and are contraindicated in patients with reduced left ventricular function.

Oral class III antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol, and amiodarone, can be used even in patients with reduced left ventricular function, and have been shown to prevent episodes of SVT (off‐label use in Japan).
125
, 
126
 However, class III antiarrhythmic drugs have a risk of proarrhythmia or extracardiac side effects, and should be considered second‐line drugs.

Oral digoxin has a prophylactic effect on SVT, but a higher dose is required for that purpose.
117
 Some clinical studies showed higher digoxin levels were associated with worse clinical outcomes.
127
 Thus, caution is advised for the clinical use of digoxin. Digoxin is contraindicated in patients with ventricular pre‐excitation, but can be used in patients with reduced left ventricular function.

The most common form of this type of SVT is antidromic reciprocating tachycardias using atriofascicular or atrioventricular Mahaim fibers that have AVN‐like tissues in the proximal portion; therefore, intravenous ATP bolus is effective for acute treatment of the tachycardia.

 As a prophylactic therapy, catheter ablation can be curative. Pharmacological prevention includes verapamil and β‐blockers despite the presence of ventricular pre‐excitation, because atriofascicular/ventricular fibers and the AVN have similar electrophysiologic properties.
130

Nodo‐fascicular and nodo‐ventricular Mahaim fibers are rare accessory pathways that can be responsible for orthodromic or antidromic reciprocating tachycardias. Because the AVN is involved in SVT using nodo‐fascicular/ventricular fibers, intravenous injection of ATP or verapamil is useful for terminating the tachycardia.
131
 Oral verapamil or β‐blockers appears effective as prophylaxis.

Intravenous β‐blockers are modestly effective in terminating and/or reducing the incidence of non‐reentrant junctional tachycardia.
132
 Intravenous verapamil or procainamide is also reasonable for the acute treatment of junctional tachycardia.
133
 Oral β‐blockers or verapamil can be used as prophylaxis.

 is also effective as a prophylactic treatment, but contraindicated in patients with reduced left ventricular function. Oral amiodarone can be considered in patients who are refractory to these treatments.
137
 Radiofrequency ablation has been performed as a potentially curative therapy; however, the risk of atrioventricular block is relatively high (5–10%). Cryoablation could be an alternative to radiofrequency ablation for safety reasons (so far, inadvertent atrioventricular block has never been reported in patients who underwent cryoablation for junctional tachycardia).

### Drugs for Differential Diagnosis of Narrow QRS Tachycardia

The recommendation and evidence level for differential diagnosis of narrow QRS tachycardia using a drug are shown in Table 14.

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Differential Diagnosis of Narrow QRS Tachycardia Using ATP

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the drugs that have been reported to inhibit atrioventricular nodular (AVN) conduction. It is effective for stopping narrow QRS tachycardia, as well as for making a differential diagnosis of atrial tachycardia and sinus tachycardia. A definitive differential diagnosis can be made between QRS and atrial or sinus tachycardia depending on whether the P wave remains constant after suppressing AVN conduction. If the tachycardia is controlled by drugs that suppress AVN conduction by the atrial wave (retrograde P wave), then orthodromic AVRT or AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is suspected. Atrial tachycardia and other AVN‐dependent supraventricular tachycardias are among those that terminate in the ventricular wave (QRS wave); therefore, it is difficult to differentiate them by ECG waveform alone.

Intravenous ATP, verapamil, and β‐blockers all selectively delay conduction of the AVN. Because ATP has an extremely short half‐life, it is often used in making a differential diagnosis and stopping supraventricular arrhythmia, and is administered in a rapid intravenous injection.
88
, 
89
 Because ATP also has the effect of suppressing the sinus node, it should be cautiously administered to patients with sick sinus syndrome.

Group I antiarrhythmic agents suppress AVN conduction, but also act on accessory pathways in atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Furthermore, it is difficult to differentiate AVRT from ectopic atrial tachycardia by 12‐lead ECG alone, because it also suppresses ectopic automaticity. The start and maintenance of AVNRT are associated with the balance between the AVN refractory period and the conduction velocity, and drugs that affect such characteristics can affect the start or maintenance of the arrhythmia. To stop tachycardia, antiarrhythmic drugs of the class IA group (e.g., procainamide, quinidine, disopyramide)
90
, 
91
, 
92
, 
93
 or IC group (e.g., flecainide, propafenone)
94
 block retrograde fast pathway conduction. In constrast, atropine and isoproterenol facilitate retrograde fast pathway or orthodromic slow pathway conduction and the induction of AVNRT.
95
, 
96
, 
97

Differential diagnoses for regular narrow QRS with long RP’ tachycardia and clear retrograde P wave (II, III, aVF, and negative P wave) observed with RP interval > PR interval include ectopic atrial tachycardia, uncommon (fast‐slow) AVNRT, and permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT).
98
 The latter two recur easily even if they are terminated and are often drug‐resistant. PJRT, as with orthodromic AVRT, is caused by a macrorentrant circuit.
99
, 
100
 However, the latent accessory pathway in this circuit is atypical; that is, it has conduction properties like the AVN, and has a long retrograde conduction time. This type of tachycardia responds to autonomic tone, catecholamines, β‐blockers, and digoxin.

### Acute Treatment of Supraventricular Tachycardia

Acute management of narrow QRS supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) begins with hemodynamic assessment. The majority of SVT patients exhibit an initial decrease in blood pressure, followed by a gradual recovery within 30 s.
101
 Although it is rare, sinus rhythm must be promptly restored by direct‐current synchronized cardioversion in patients with hemodynamic compromise (Figure 6, Table 15).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Treatment of Narrow QRS SVT*1

*1In patients with wide QRS SVT due to antidromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, i.v. ATP, verapamil, diltiazem or β‐blocker should be avoided, but i.v. class I antiarrhythmic drugs are recommended (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence C, MINDS grade of recommendation C1, MINDS level of evidence V). *2Off‐label use in Japan. *3Class of recommendation of i.v. verapamil or diltiazem is IIb in patients with SVT who have ventricular pre‐excitation during sinus rhythm. *4Contraindication in patients with a reduced left ventricular function.

Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

In hemodynamically stable patients, vagal maneuvers are the first‐line intervention to terminate SVT.
102
, 
103
, 
104
 There are several techniques used to increase vagal parasympathetic tone, including the Valsalva maneuver and carotid sinus massage. The Valsalva maneuver is performed by forceful attempted exhalation against a closed airway to raise intrathoracic pressure for 10–30 s. An increase in vagal tone occurs after releasing the Valsalva strain. It has recently been reported that leg lifting immediately at the end of the Valsalva strain enhances the vagal effect.
102
 Carotid massage is performed after the absence of bruit is confirmed by auscultation, by applying steady pressure over the right carotid sinus for 5–10 s. When right carotid massage is ineffective, left carotid massage is worth attempting. Because success in terminating SVT with vagal maneuvers depends on the physician’s skills and experience, pharmacological treatments are sometimes preferred as first‐line therapy.

If vagal maneuvers fail or are not attempted, an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the drug of choice (off‐label use in Japan).
105
, 
106
, 
107
 When administered intravenously, ATP is rapidly dephosphorylated into adenosine, which suppresses the atrioventricular node (AVN), resulting in termination of AVN‐dependent tachycardias such as AVN reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). The initial dose of ATP is 5–10 mg. If SVT persists, ATP administration can be repeated up to a maximum of 20 mg (high‐dose ATP should be used with caution because severe bradycardia occurs more frequently). Because the half‐life of ATP is extremely short (<10 s), a 10–20 mL flush of normal saline must follow the ATP injection when administered from a peripheral vein for ATP to reach the heart. Rapid intravenous ATP injection often results in unpleasant but transient side effects (flushing, chest discomfort, and headache, etc.). Thus, patients should be informed about such side effects before injection. ATP should be avoided in patients with bronchial asthma because of the bronchospastic effect of ATP.

When SVT does not respond to ATP or recurs immediately after termination with ATP, intravenous infusion of Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil 5 mg or diltiazem 10 mg) given over 5 min is the next treatment of choice. Ca2+ channel blockers suppress the AVN similar to ATP but are longer acting than ATP. Success rates of ATP and Ca2+ channel blockers for SVT termination range from 80% to 95%.
105
, 
106
, 
108
 Ca2+ channel blockers should be avoided in patients with heart failure, because it is associated with a risk of hemodynamic deterioration.

When SVT does not respond to these treatments, AVN‐independent atrial tachycardia (AT) is the likely mechanism and intravenous class I antiarrhythmic drugs may be effective. Intravenous amiodarone can be considered in patients with a reduced left ventricular function (off‐label use in Japan).

If episodes of SVT are infrequent, a self‐administered single‐dose oral drug treatment might be useful. However, the usefulness of oral verapamil monotherapy has not been proven.
109
 The combination of oral diltiazem and propranolol appears effective in terminating AVN‐dependent tachycardias (e.g., AVNRT and AVRT), but the overall safety of these medications remains unclear because syncope has been reported as an adverse event.
110

In patients with wide QRS SVT due to antidromic AVRT, AVN‐suppressing drugs should be avoided. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide or flecainide are the first treatment of choice for terminating antidromic AVRT.

### Prophylactic Therapy

If the episodes of SVT are short and self‐limited, prophylactic therapy is not necessarily needed.
111
 When the SVT episodes are long enough to require acute management, catheter ablation is recommended as a first‐line prophylactic therapy that can provide a definitive cure with a high success rate (≥90%) and favorable safety profile.
112
, 
113
 Pharmacological treatments are indicated as prophylactic therapy in patients who are unwilling to undergo catheter ablation or have an unsuccessful catheter ablation (Figure 7, Table 16).

Oral verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers reduce the frequency and duration of SVT episodes, and are the treatment of choice for pharmacological prophylactic therapy in the majority of patients with SVT who do not have ventricular pre‐excitation during sinus rhythm.
114
, 
115
, 
116
, 
117
 Patients with ventricular pre‐excitation may develop atrial fibrillation during SVT and be exposed to increased risk of ventricular fibrillation by accelerating conduction over the accessory pathway while receiving verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers, so these drugs must be used with caution even when the ventricular pre‐excitation is intermittent. Also, oral verapamil and diltiazem should be avoided in patients with reduced left ventricular function because they can be harmful through their negative inotropic effect.

If oral verapamil, diltiazem, or β‐blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, oral class I antiarrhythmic drugs can be effective. A wide variety of class I antiarrhythmic drugs are available in Japan. The effectiveness and safety of oral flecainide or propafenone, which can be used in Western countries, have been well studied.
114
, 
118
, 
119
, 
120
 Other oral class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as procainamide,
121
 disopyramide,
122
 cibenzoline,
123
 aprindine,
124
 and pilsicainide, appear to have similar effectiveness, although the evidence is limited. Disopyramide, cibenzoline, pilsicainide, flecainide, and propafenone have a negative inotropic effect and are contraindicated in patients with reduced left ventricular function.

Oral class III antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol, and amiodarone, can be used even in patients with reduced left ventricular function, and have been shown to prevent episodes of SVT (off‐label use in Japan).
125
, 
126
 However, class III antiarrhythmic drugs have a risk of proarrhythmia or extracardiac side effects, and should be considered second‐line drugs.

Oral digoxin has a prophylactic effect on SVT, but a higher dose is required for that purpose.
117
 Some clinical studies showed higher digoxin levels were associated with worse clinical outcomes.
127
 Thus, caution is advised for the clinical use of digoxin. Digoxin is contraindicated in patients with ventricular pre‐excitation, but can be used in patients with reduced left ventricular function.

### Atypical Supraventricular Tachycardias

The most common form of this type of SVT is antidromic reciprocating tachycardias using atriofascicular or atrioventricular Mahaim fibers that have AVN‐like tissues in the proximal portion; therefore, intravenous ATP bolus is effective for acute treatment of the tachycardia.
128
, 
129
 As a prophylactic therapy, catheter ablation can be curative. Pharmacological prevention includes verapamil and β‐blockers despite the presence of ventricular pre‐excitation, because atriofascicular/ventricular fibers and the AVN have similar electrophysiologic properties.
130

Nodo‐fascicular and nodo‐ventricular Mahaim fibers are rare accessory pathways that can be responsible for orthodromic or antidromic reciprocating tachycardias. Because the AVN is involved in SVT using nodo‐fascicular/ventricular fibers, intravenous injection of ATP or verapamil is useful for terminating the tachycardia.
131
 Oral verapamil or β‐blockers appears effective as prophylaxis.

Intravenous β‐blockers are modestly effective in terminating and/or reducing the incidence of non‐reentrant junctional tachycardia.
132
 Intravenous verapamil or procainamide is also reasonable for the acute treatment of junctional tachycardia.

 Radiofrequency ablation has been performed as a potentially curative therapy; however, the risk of atrioventricular block is relatively high (5–10%). Cryoablation could be an alternative to radiofrequency ablation for safety reasons (so far, inadvertent atrioventricular block has never been reported in patients who underwent cryoablation for junctional tachycardia).

### ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

AF is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice and its prevalence increases with age. AF is also associated with the risk of developing some adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death. Therefore, the burden imposed on the medical system by AF is expected to increase with the increase in the population aged ≥65 years. Therefore, epidemiological information such as the prevalence of AF and related factors is important.

The prevalence of AF depends not only on age, but also on conditions such as sex, race, hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and socioeconomic factors.
141
, 
142
, 
143
, 
144
, 
145
 The prevalence of AF is increasing year by year. A community‐based Framingham Heart Study reported that the prevalence of age‐adjusted AF has quadrupled (i.e., in men from 20.4 to 96.2 per 1,000 person‐years and in women from 13.7 to 49.4 per 1,000 person‐years)
146
 However, because the increased prevalence of AF may be due to an increased rate of risk factors, including older age, as well as improved detection methods for asymptomatic AF, interpretation of data requires caution.
146
 In Japan, an epidemiological study was conducted by the Japanese Circulation Society,
147
 and the results of periodical health checkups in 2003 (630,138 people aged ≥40 years who underwent health checkups) showed that the prevalence of AF increased with age in both men and women. The percentage increased to 3.44% for men and 1.12% for women in their 70 s; 4.43% for men and 2.19% for women over 80 years old. When this result is applied to the Japanese population and calculated, it is estimated that 716,000 people in Japan had AF as of 2005.
147
 When calculated using future population projections, it is predicted that by 2050 there will be approximately 1.03 million AF patients, accounting for approximately 1.1% of the total population.

Addressing modifiable clinical risk factors may reduce the long‐term risk of developing AF or delay the onset of disease. Therefore, identification, prevention, and treatment of such conditions are important to prevent the development of AF. However, it should be noted that it is unclear how the treatment and removal of a single modifiable risk factor reduces the risk of AF (Table 17).

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Assessing Risk of AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Hypertension is the most widely accepted risk factor for AF.
141
, 
142
, 
143
, 
144
, 
145
 It is reported that 56.5% of AF cases had ≥1 risk factors, of which hypertension was the most important factor.
142
, 
148
 It has also been reported that differences in long‐term patterns, such as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure and a longer history of antihypertensive treatment, are associated with an increased risk of developing AF.
149
 An urban cohort study of cerebral and cardiovascular disease among Japanese reported that the hazard ratio of systolic blood pressure in AF was further increased by being overweight.
150

An increase in fasting glucose of 18 mg/dL increased the risk of developing AF by 33% in a test population with impaired glucose tolerance.
151
 However, no clear association between AF and diabetes has been suggested.
146
, 
151
, 
152
 In addition, intensive glycemic control has not been shown to improve the new incidence of AF.
153

Reports have been increasing in recent years suggesting a link between obesity and AF. The number of obese patients tend to increase,
146
 and an increase in body mass index (BMI) is associated with AF.
152
 Importantly, among the modifiable risk factors, obesity is the most prominent risk factor affecting the lifetime risk of AF.
146
, 
152
, 
154
 In addition, a study that examined the relationship between changes in BMI over 10 years and AF showed that decreased BMI decreased AF risk and increased BMI increased AF risk in both men and women.
155

An increasing number of reports suggest a relationship between sleep‐disordered breathing and AF risk. Meta‐analysis results suggest that sleep‐disordered breathing may increase the risk of AF, and the higher the severity, the higher the risk of AF.
156
, 
157

A limited number of studies have examined the relationship between uric acid and AF. In a cross‐sectional study of 325,771 patients undergoing regular physical examinations at a single health center in Japan, serum uric acid levels were independent of other cardiovascular risk factors for AF in both men and women. It was significantly associated with prevalence.
158
 Besides, the result of a retrospective study of 49,292 Japanese diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and hyperuricemia or gout by a regular medical examination in a single hospital from January 2004 to June 2010 but without receiving uric acid‐lowering drugs, showed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor for AF.
159

Smoking is a known risk factor for AF.
142
, 
152
, 
160
 It has also been reported that smokers with AF are at increased risk of hospitalization and death.
145
 A nearly 2‐year prospective study investigating the association between AF and smoking and total tobacco consumption in hospitalized patients in a single hospital in Japan found that current smokers and smokers with a Brinkman index ≥800, were independently associated with new onset of AF. However, in current smokers, the Brinkman index does not differ in hazard ratio, suggesting the importance of stopping smoking to prevent AF.
161

Meta‐analysis results indicate that AF risk increases with increasing alcohol consumption.
162
, 
163
 It has been reported that the risk of developing AF increases by 5% and the left atrium expands by 0.16 mm for every 10 g of daily alcohol intake (equivalent to a full glass).
164

It has been reported that the lifetime risk of AF is significantly increased even if only 1 clinical risk factor is present.
152
 The CHARGE‐AF score for AF risk assessment has been developed from research focusing on multiple cohorts, including age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, current smoking, treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and diabetes features.
144
 This score has subsequently been shown to be useful in predicting AF risk in multiple cohorts.
165
 In Japan, a 10‐year risk score for AF has been created using traditional risk factors that can be easily obtained by ordinary outpatient clinics, but the results of external verification of risk scores using other cohorts are awaited.
148

The lifetime risk of AF varies significantly with an increased genetic predisposition in addition to clinical risk factors.
160
, 
166
, 
167
 A community‐based Framingham study has reported the long‐term potential for AF considering the CHARGE‐AF score consisting of clinical risk factors, and the genetic predisposition estimated by a genetic risk score generated from approximately 1,000 AF‐related single nucleotide polymorphisms.
160
 It was suggested that the lifetime risk of AF in individuals with a high genetic risk score was sufficiently high even with a low CHARGE‐AF score. Atrial fibrillation was also presumed to occur earlier in individuals with high CHARGE‐AF scores than in individuals with low CHARGE‐AF scores, regardless of genetic risk score.
160

The generation of both abnormal excitation (automaticity/auto‐excitation) as a trigger for premature beats and formation of a substrate constituting reentry circuit of AF in the atrium and the pulmonary vein, play a pivotal role for onset and maintenance of AF. Risk factors and AF itself form the substrate. Electrical remodeling alters the ion channels expression, causing conduction disturbance and shortened refractory periods, whereas structural remodeling induced by atrial fibrosis impairs the conduction disturbance. Besides, atrial remodeling (ATR) enhances coagulation to form thrombus. As shown in Figure 8, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea are identified as risk factors for atrial remodeling.
168

Risk factors contributing to both atrial remodeling and formation of thrombus. DAD, delayed afterdepolarization; EAD, early afterdepolarization; ERP, effective refractory period; RAS, renin–angiotensin system; SAS, sleep apnea syndrome.

Either external stress, induced by structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory disease, or AF itself cause structural remodeling of the atrium. Pathophysiological changes responsible for ATR are characterized by activation of fibroblasts, increased connective tissue, fibrosis etc.
169
, 
170
, 
171
 In addition, atrial fat infiltration, inflammatory cell infiltration, hypertrophy, and necrosis, as well as deposition of amyloid are also observed. The structural remodeling disturbs electrical coupling among cardiac muscle fibers and causes heterogeneity of local electrical conductions, which facilitates formation of a reentry circuit.
172

ATR reduces the contractility of atrial muscles in association with enlargement of the atrium, which facilitates blood congestion in the atrium, thus accelerating thrombus formation. Activation of both the renin–angiotensin system
173
, 
174
, 
175
, 
176
 and the autonomic nervous system
177
, 
178
, 
179
 contribute to vascular remodeling, which induces atrial muscle ischemia, leading to ATR. On the other hand, ATR activates the expression of thrombus formation factors on the atrial endothelium together with activation of platelets and inflammatory cells, which contribute to thrombus formation.
180
, 
181
 These intra‐atrial activations and circulating coagulation factors could explain the onset of stroke following a short episode of AF.

Both the electrical remodeling responsible for the arrhythmogenic substrate and the abnormal automaticity responsible for the trigger underly the electrophysiological mechanism of AF.

The trigger for reentry arrythmia is defined as early ectopic excitation derived from a source different from the sinus node. Approximately 90% of ectopic excitation originates from the myocardial sleeve localized in the pulmonary vein. Some ectopic excitation derives from ectopic triggers in the area of either the superior vena cava or atrium as well. Underlying mechanisms on trigger are as described.

Impaired regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration induces Ca2+ leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the diastolic phase of cardiac myocytes, which plays a pivotal role in the generation of the trigger responsible for AF. In AF, the Ca2+ handling proteins have been hyperphosphorylated, which elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and induces spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR. This increases the inward currents on the cell membrane via activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger causes the delayed afterdepolarization
182
, 
183
, 
184
, 
185
, 
186
 associated with triggered activity that facilitate ectopic excitation and leads to AF.
187
 Furthermore, activation of sympathetic nervous system augments the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, facilitating abnormal automaticity and triggered activity.
188

Hassaguerre et al
189
 demonstrated that automaticity excitation induced by triggered activity in the pulmonary vein becomes the trigger for AF, and the boundary between the pulmonary vein and atrial muscles forms the reentry circuit, which results in sustained AF.
190
, 
191
 This hierarchy of trigger and substrate in AF is observed in patients with paroxysmal AF,
192
, 
193
 although it remains unclear whether this hierarchy occurs in patients with sustained AF.
194

Moe and Abildskov
179
 demonstrated that AF could be sustained via multiple independent wavelets, which are conducted in a disorderly way through the muscular layer of the atrium. Many experimental and clinical observations support the multiple wavelet hypothesis.
195
 However, localized excitation (i.e., ectopic excitation, rotor and other stable reentry circuits) conducting to atrial fibrillation resembels to the spiral wave derived from multiple wavelet, so it is impossible to distinguish it from sustained AF caused by multiple wavelets.

The transition from paroxysmal AF to sustained AF is defined by the concept of “AF begets AF”.
196
 This concept encompasses the shortening of both the atrial refractory period and cycle length.
196
, 
197
 Although the number of electrical reentry circuits determines the sustainment of AF, the shorter the wave length of the reentry circuit becomes, the larger the number of reentry circuits, contributing to sustainability of AF (wave length hypothesis).
198
 The underlying mechanism is as follows. First, repeated excitation physiologically shortens the effective refectory period via the inducing of intracellular Ca2+ overloading, which is followed by progressive pathological shortening of the atrial refractory period through both downregulation of Ca2+ channel current and upregulation of inward‐rectifier K+ channel currents.
199
, 
200
 As well, the decreases in the expression of Na+ channel current and I
to currents results in both shortening of the refractory period and a reduction in conduction velocity. On the other hand, activation of parasympathetic nerve tone shortens the atrial action potential duration via activation of the acetylcholine‐sensitive K+ channel, which facilitates the formation of a reentry circuit in the atrium.
198

In general, AF starts as the paroxysmal form. The duration and frequency of the episodes increase with time, until AF becomes persistent and permanent. AF can be classified as 1 of 5 forms as described in Figure 9, 
202
, 
203
 and Table 18.

 899 first‐diagnosed AF patients were observed during a mean period of 4.1 years. Within 1 year, AF recurred in ≈50% of the patients. During the follow‐up period, 6–7% of the patients developed cerebral infarction.
204

Paroxysmal AF is AF that is self‐terminating, in most cases, within 48 h. Some AF paroxysms may continue for up to 7 days. In a Japanese study, during a mean follow‐up period of 14.1 years, paroxysmal AF eventually transited to the permanent form under conventional antiarrhythmic therapy (5.5% of patients per year).
205

AF that lasts longer than 7 days. The actuarial cumulative percentages of patients who maintained sinus rhythm after serial cardioversion treatment was reported to be 42% and 27% after 1 and 4 years, respectively.
206

Continuous AF lasting for ≥1 year, when it is decided to adopt a rhythm control strategy by cardioversion and/or catheter ablation.

AF that is accepted by the patient (and physician).

The recommendation for the evaluation method of AF based on symptoms is given in Table 19. The modified European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) divides the original class 2 into mild (2a) or moderate (2b) effect
207
 (Table 20). Class 2b identifies patients with a health utility benefit of rhythm control; this modification may provide a threshold for potential treatment decisions. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation (CCS‐SAF) scale is also available.

In a Japanese single‐center study,
206
 first‐diagnosed AF patients without structural heart disease (n=289) were reviewed with regard to 2 symptom classifications (CCS‐SAF and EHRA). In both classifications, asymptomatic patients comprised ≈40% of the patients. The Fushimi AF registry
207
 investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF (n=1,837) or persistent/permanent (sustained AF; n=1,912) subgroups. Multivariable analysis indicated that age (≥75 years), history of stroke/systemic embolism, male sex, and chronic kidney disease were independent determinants of asymptomatic status in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas age was nonsignificant in the sustained AF group. During the follow‐up period, all‐cause death was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group compared with symptomatic patients in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas it was comparable in the sustained AF group.
210

The term “cryptogenic stroke” refers to a stroke for which there is no specific attributable cause after a comprehensive evaluation.
211
 There is persuasive evidence that most cryptogenic strokes are thromboembolic. The thrombus is thought to originate from any of several well‐established potential embolic sources, including minor‐risk or covert cardiac sources, veins via paradoxical embolism, and non‐occlusive atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch or the cervical, or cerebral arteries. Accordingly, the term “embolic strokes of undetermined source” (ESUS) was proposed for a therapeutically relevant entity, which is defined as a non‐lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic source.
212
 The diagnostic criteria for ESUS are described in Table 21. Undiagnosed AF is considered to be one of the causes of ESUS. NAVIGATE ESUS tested the hypothesis that anticoagulant treatment with rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may result in a lower risk of recurrent stroke than aspirin.
213
 A total of 7,213 participants were enrolled at 459 sites: 3,609 patients were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban and 3,604 to receive aspirin. Recurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism was not different between the 2 groups. However, major bleeding occurred in 62 patients in the rivaroxaban group (annualized rate, 1.8%) and in 23 in the aspirin group (annualized rate, 0.7%) (P<0.001). It was concluded that rivaroxaban was not superior to aspirin with regard to the prevention of recurrent stroke after an initial ESUS and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
213
 The reason why rivaroxaban could not show superiority to aspirin remains unclear. Recent improvement in diagnostic technology for undiagnosed AF might lead to enrollment of fewer patients in whom stroke was caused by AF. In RE‐SPECT ESUS, among patients with a recent history of ESUS, dabigatran was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke. The incidence of major bleeding was not greater in the dabigatran group than in the aspirin group, but there were more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in the dabigatran group.

The recommendations and levels of evidence for detecting AF are described in Table 22. Pulse check is the simplest method. The Japanese Stroke Association (JSA) and the JHRS have annually determined March 9th as “A day for pulse”, and March 9–15th as “A week of AF”. On their website (http://www.shinbousaidou‐week.org/), JSA and JHRS emphasize the importance of pulse check.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Screening for AF

In patients experiencing a cerebral infarction, the presence of AF is occasionally observed on 12‐lead ECG or monitor ECG after admission. EMBRACE
215
 randomly assigned 572 patients aged 55 years or older, without known AF, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24‐h ECG), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30‐day event‐triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24‐h monitor (control group). Within 90 days of randomization, AF lasting ≥30 s was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (P<0.001). CRYSTAL AF
216
 was a randomized, controlled study of 441 patients to assess whether long‐term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) was more effective than conventional follow‐up (control) for detecting AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke. By 6 months, AF had been detected in 8.9% of patients in the ICM group (19 patients) versus 1.4% of patients in the control group (3 patients) (P<0.001). By 12 months, AF had been detected in 12.4% of patients in the ICM group (29 patients) versus 2.0% of patients in the control group (4 patients) (P<0.001). Sposato et al
217
 reported studies that provided the number of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who were newly diagnosed with AF. They stratified the cardiac monitoring methods into 4 sequential phases of screening: phase 1 (emergency room) consisted of admission ECG; phase 2 (in hospital) comprised serial ECG, continuous inpatient ECG monitoring, continuous inpatient cardiac telemetry, and in‐hospital Holter monitoring; phase 3 (first ambulatory period) consisted of ambulatory Holter ECG; and phase 4 (second ambulatory period) consisted of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, external loop recording, and implantable loop recording. The summary proportions of patients diagnosed with post‐stroke AF were 7.7% in phase 1, 5.1% in phase 2, 10.7% in phase 3, and 16.9% in phase 4. The overall AF detection yield after all phases of sequential cardiac monitoring was 23.7%.
217
 The AF detection rate increases in proportion to the ECG monitoring period. However, some researchers question whether AF detected 1–2 years after cerebral infarction was really involved in the development of cerebral infarction. From 2016, ICM to detect AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke has been covered by insurance in Japan.

In patients with an implanted pacemaker or ICD, atrial high rate episodes (AHRE) can be detected by analysis of intracardiac ECG recordings. Most cases of AHRE can be considered to be AF. ASSERT
219
 enrolled 2,580 patients, aged ≥65 years, with hypertension and no history of AF, in whom a pacemaker or defibrillator had recently been implanted. The patients were monitored for 3 months to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (episodes of atrial rate >190 beats/min for >6 min) and followed them for a mean of 2.5 years for the primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. By 3 months, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias detected by implanted devices had occurred in 261 patients (10.1%), and were associated with an increased risk of clinical AF (P<0.001) and of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.007). In ASSERT, subclinical AF episodes varied in duration. In a subanalysis of ASSERT,
220
 among 2,455 patients during a mean follow‐up of 2.5 years, the longest single episode of subclinical AF lasted >6 min to 6 h in 462 patients (18.8%), >6–24 h in 169 (6.9%), and >24 h in 262 (10.7%). Subclinical AF duration >24 h was associated with a significant increased risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in patients with subclinical AF between 6 min and 24 h was not significantly different from that of patients without subclinical AF.

The documentation of AF on 12‐lead ECG recording is required for the diagnosis of AF. The recommendations and levels of evidence for diagnosis and evaluation of patients with AF is described in Table 23.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Diagnosis of AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; ECG, electrocardiogram.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with AF are described in Table 24.
21
 Death due to stroke can largely be mitigated by anticoagulation, but other cardiovascular deaths (e.g., due to heart failure or sudden death) remain common even in AF patients treated according to the current evidence base. AF is also associated with increased morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke. Contemporary studies show that 20–30% of patients with an ischemic stroke have had AF diagnosed before, during, or after the initial event. White matter lesions in the brain, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life (QOL), and depressed mood are common in AF patients, and between 10% and 40% of AF patients are hospitalized each year. Although most published studies have demonstrated associations between AF and impaired cognition, no AF treatment has yet been associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive decline or dementia.

Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality Associated With AF

This guideline proposes a 5‐step plan for acute and chronic management of patients with AF (Table 25).
21
 Firstly, if the patient presents with hemodynamic instability or and/or severe symptoms, urgent management is required, including cardioversion. Secondly, precipitating factors, including unfavorable lifestyle and underlying cardiovascular diseases should be managed. Thirdly, following assessment of thromboembolic risk, oral anticoagulants should be administered to patients at risk of thromboembolism. Fourthly, in patients with persistent and permanent AF, rate control <110 beats/min should be considered. Fifthly, following assessment of symptoms, the indication of a rhythm control strategy should be considered. In this regard, there are 4 options: antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion, catheter ablation and surgery. Through steps 1–4, improved life expectancy can be obtained. Through steps 1–5, improved QOL, autonomy and social functioning can be expected. Regarding step 5, recent studies have reported that improved life expectancy can be obtained by catheter ablation. In CASTLE‐AF,
232
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy. In CABANA,
233
 among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower‐than‐expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.
223
 In CABANA,
224
 catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, led to clinically important and significant improvements in QOL at 12 months.

GARFIELD‐AF
225
 was an observational study of adults with first‐diagnosed non‐valvular AF. The 2‐year outcomes of 17,162 patients prospectively enrolled in GARFIELD‐AF were analyzed. The mean age was 69.8 years, 43.8% were women, and the mean CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 3.3; 60.8% of patients were prescribed anticoagulant therapy with/without antiplatelet therapy, 27.4% antiplatelet monotherapy, and 11.8% no antithrombotic therapy. At 2‐year follow‐up, all‐cause death, stroke/systemic embolism, and major bleeding had occurred at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 3.83 (3.62; 4.05), 1.25 (1.13; 1.38), and 0.70 (0.62; 0.81) per 100 person‐years, respectively. Rates for all 3 major events were highest during the first 4 months. Congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, sudden/unwitnessed death, malignancy, respiratory failure, and infection/sepsis accounted for 65% of all known causes of death, and strokes for <10%. Anticoagulant treatment was associated with a 35% lower risk of death. In Japan, in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry,
226
 during a median follow‐up of 1,105 days, there were 705 all‐cause deaths (5.5%/year); 180 cardiovascular (CV) (26% of total deaths), 381 non‐CV (54%), and 144 undetermined causes (20%). The most common causes of CV and non‐CV death were heart failure (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis (17.3%), while mortality due to stroke was only 6.5%. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest indicator of CV death was pre‐existing heart failure and that of non‐CV death was anemia. Taken together, it is suggested that a more comprehensive approach to the management of non‐valvular AF may be needed to improve outcomes.

The expert consensus statement of the EHRA, HRS, Asia Pacific HRS, and the Latin American HRS summarizes the consensus of the international writing group and is based on a thorough review of the medical literature regarding cognitive function in arrhythmias.
227
 Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with or without a history of clinical stroke. Some of the reported brain morphometric changes include: hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and frontal medial lobe atrophy.
227
 Because the precise mechanism(s) of cognitive disorders in patients with AF is not fully known, the optimal way of preventing cognitive dysfunction for a given patient remains to be established. The expert consensus statement
227
 described the recommendations “may do this” for measures to prevent cognitive dysfunction in AF patients, as follows. (1) Appropriate anticoagulation in patients with AF and stroke risk factors should be applied for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. (2) Consider DOACs instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) when using oral anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke in AF, which may have a beneficial effect on subsequent cognitive disorders. (3) In patients with AF managed with long‐term VKA, a high anticoagulation time in therapeutic range may be beneficial for optimal prevention of new‐onset dementia. (4) General health measures (prevention of smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes, sleep apnea, and appropriate control of all risk factors) may reduce the concomitant risks of AF (new onset or recurrence) and stroke, with a putative benefit on cognitive function. (5) Prevention of cognitive dysfunction in AF may include general measures proposed in vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. (6) Cognitive assessment should be performed in AF patients whenever there is suspicion of cognitive impairment.

Heart failure (HF) and AF coincide in many patients. In the Japanese Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure,
228
 the management of AF is described as the initial part of comorbidity. In AF‐CHF,
229
 a total of 1,376 congestive HF patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm‐control group and 694 in the rate‐control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to death from cardiovascular cause, death from any cause, stroke, or worsening HF. It was concluded that for patients with AF and congestive HF, a routine strategy of rhythm control did not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate‐control strategy.Recently, however, catheter ablation for AF, as a rhythm‐control strategy, has shown remarkable improvements in efficacy and safety. In CASTLE‐AF,
222
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with HF was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening HF than was medical therapy. In response to the results of CASTLE‐AF, in the 2018 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias
4
 catheter ablation in AF patients with HF (LV dysfunction) was recommended as class IIa. In patients with HF with preserved or mid‐range ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFmrEF), AF was associated with similarly increased risk of death, HF hospitalization, and stroke or TIA.
230
, 
231
 Recently, catheter ablation of AF had reportedly similar effectiveness in patients with HF, regardless of the presence of systolic dysfunction.
232
, 
233
 In the study by Black‐Maier et al,
233
 there were no significant differences in procedural characteristics, arrhythmia‐free recurrence, or functional improvements between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. A large‐scale study is necessary to prove the effectiveness of catheter ablation in AF patients with HFpEF.

Approximately 30% of patients with AF have some form of valvular heart disease. Valvular heart disease is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk, Recently, the number of patients with mitral stenosis has drastically decreased, but with mitral regurgitation is increasing. It is very important to distinguish functional mitral regurgitation from the primary form. When valve dysfunction is severe, AF can be regarded as a marker for progressive disease, thus favoring valve repair or replacement. The Maze procedure to restore sinus rhythm should be considered.

Hypertension is a risk of new‐onset of AF, and promotes its progression. It also increases the risk of stroke. Sufficient antihypertensive treatment is required. There has been an argument that lowering blood pressure by angiotensin II‐receptor blockers may have more beneficial effects than using conventional Ca2+ channel blockers. In this regard, the J‐RHYTHM II study demonstrated that in patients with paroxysmal AF and hypertension, treatment of hypertension by candesartan did not have an advantage over amlodipine in reducing the frequency of paroxysmal AF.
234
 Similarly, in GISSI‐AF, treatment with valsartan was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of recurrent AF.
235

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a component of the CHADS2 score. Long disease duration leads to an increase in the risk of thromboembolism. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study,
153
 a total of 10,082 patients with DM were studied in a randomized, double‐blind fashion. Intensive glycemic control did not affect the rate of new‐onset AF. Nonetheless, patients with DM and incident AF had an increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared with those without AF.
153

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of obesity in AF patients is described in Table 26. Obesity promotes LV diastolic dysfunction, sympathetic activation and systemic inflammation.
236
 Conversely, stable weight loss decreases the AF burden and risk of AF recurrence.
236

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Managing Obese Patients With AF

Recommendations and levels of evidence for management of AF patients with obstructive sleep disorder are described in Table 27. Obstructive sleep disorder promotes AF, probably via hypoxemia, hypercapnia, inflammation, and exaggerated alteration of thoracic pressure, and autonomic dysfunction. When AF patients are suspected to have obstructive sleep disorder, further evaluation using multiple sleep latency tests is required. Following definitive diagnosis, appropriate management using continuous positive airway pressure is required.

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of AF patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are described in Table 28. AF is frequently associated with CKD. The proper dosage of each DOACs is set by renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance). Caution is required, because the level of creatinine clearance in patients with AF decreases over time.

Risk assessment for thromboembolism is important for the management of patients with AF in the clinical setting, especially when considering anticoagulation therapy (Table 29).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Risk Assessment of AF

*1Cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease), persistent and permanent AF, renal dysfunction, low body weight (≤50 kg), left atrial diameter (>45 mm). *2Older age (≥75 years), low body weight (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), antiplatelet use, and uncontrolled hypertension.

Valvular AF should be distinguished from non‐valvular AF because warfarin is the only oral anticoagulant (OAC) approved for valvular AF. The effectiveness or safety of DOACs for valvular AF has never been proven.
238
, 
239
 “Valvular” means rheumatic mitral valve diseases (predominantly mitral stenosis) and the postoperative state with mechanical prosthetic valves. So far, among artificial valves, bioprosthetic valves have been categorized as “valvular” in the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013).
2
 However, recent reports on the use of DOACs for patients with AF after bioprosthetic valve replacement have suggested that the efficacy of DOACs to prevent thromboembolism was comparable with that of warfarin;
240
, 
241
, 
242
 although the safety of DOACs for bleeding might have been superior to that of warfarin,
240
 the numbers of subjects were relatively small in those studies. According to this evidence, bioprosthetic valves were considered as “non‐valvular” in a joint consensus document from the heart rhythm associations of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America in 2017.
243
 The 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focuse update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline followed this standpoint.
244

In this guideline, the definition of “non‐valvular” is updated to include bioprosthetic valves. The postoperative state of mitral valve repair (mitral annulorrhaphy or annuloplasty) and non‐rheumatic mitral regurgitation are included as “non‐valvular”, similar to the latest guidelines.
2
 (Because the effect‐efficacy of DOACs was described as “the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF” in a statement of the virtues of medicine, the echocardiographic findings of valve stenosis and regurgitation have often misled physicians in an insured medical treatment.) Because DOACs have been approved for the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF, the definition of “non‐valvular” is important at the selection of DOAC or warfarin. Generally, there is no inconvenience to including all valvular diseases as “non‐valvular”, except mitral stenosis and mechanical prosthetic valves.

In patients with non‐valvular AF (NVAF), because the accumulation of risk factors for thromboembolism increases the incidence of cardiogenic ischemic stroke,
245
, 
246
 it is recommended to determine appropriate anticoagulation therapy based on the risk assessment for thromboembolism. Assessments using risk scores have the advantage of standardization of risks evaluated by each physician.

In the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013),
2
 the CHADS2 score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 30)
245
 This score assigns 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (maximum 6 points). The risks for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score are stratified as low, intermediate, and high for scores of 0, 1, and ≥2, respectively.

CHADS2 Score

Maximum score: 6.

Abbreviation: TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Gage BF, et al. 2001.245)

In the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
247
 the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 31).
248
 This score comprises age ≥75 years and a history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism for 2 points and the other components of the CHADS2 score, vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), age 65–74 years, and sex category (female sex) for 1 point (maximum 9 points). In the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study
249
 cited in the ESC guidelines,
244
 factors in addition to the CHADS2 score showed a significant risk for thromboembolism. Consequently, the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted again in the 2016 ESC guidelines developed in collaboration with EACTS.
21
 This score was also adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline
250
 in the USA and by the Asian Pacific Heart Rhythm Society.

CHA2DS2‐VASc Score

Maximum score: 9.

Abbreviation: TE, thromboembolism; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Lip GY, et al. 2010.

)

In contrast, the CHADS2 score
245
 was again adopted in this Japanese guideline as well as in the previous version of the guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 although opinions on which risk score is suitable for Japanese patients with NVAF differed among specialists. One principal reason is that the simple CHADS2 score should be propagated first, because the use of a risk score was not sufficiently widespread in the clinical setting when the latest guidelines were published (JCS 2013).
2
 Although the CHADS2 score has several problems and is imperfect, the risk score needs to be simple to encourage non‐specialists to continue active risk assessment.
251
 In addition, the factors added to the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) were not a significant risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database).
252
 Because a superior novel risk score of simplicity and predicability has not yet been established since the publication of the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 risk assessment for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score is the most suitable for Japanese patients for the moment. Other influential factors not included in the CHADS2 score can be thought of as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy as in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2

Components of the CHADS2 score
245
 were derived from patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy among the pooled data of 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) (n=3,432)
253
, 
254
, 
255
 and the first 2 trials in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) (n=2,012).
256
, 
257
, 
258
 Age, hypertension, prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA), and diabetes mellitus were detected from the AFI, whereas hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >160 mmHg), prior cerebral ischemia, recent heart failure, and women aged ≥75 years were detected as risk factors for ischemic stroke from SPAF III. These factors were amalgamated and used to determine the 5 factors in the current CHADS2 score.
245
 This clinical classification scheme was validated using data from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) consisting of 1,733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–95 years with NVAF who were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.
245
 The incidence rate of ischemic stroke per 100 patient‐years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 for each 1‐point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 for a score of 0, 2.8 for 1, 4.0 for 2, 5.9 for 3, 8.5 for 4, 12.5 for 5, and 18.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11A).
245
 Although these rates are often used as the gold standard for informed consent, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy in a pooled analysis of the 3 major AF registries
252
 were obviously lower than those in the original report by Gage et al
245
 and in other reports
259
 from foreign countries: 0.5 for a score of 0, 0.9 for 1, 1.5 for 2, 2.7 for 3, 6.1 for 4, 3.9 for 5, and 7.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11B).
252
 Therefore, the original incidence rates
245
 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current Japanese patients. The original rates should be interpreted cautiously because all subjects in the NRAF used for validation of the CHADS2 score were older (range, 65–95; mean, 81 years) and standard therapeutic drugs for hypertension and heart failure were different from those used today.

Although the CHADS2 score consists of 5 factors, only 3 (hypertension, age ≥75 years, and a history of stroke or TIA) were identified as significant risks for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database),
252
 and congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus were not (Table 32).

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

)

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF. The risk for thromboembolism is comparable between patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved EF (HFpEF).
231
 In phase III trials using DOACs,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 HF was defined as either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or more, or HF symptoms within previous 3–6 months.

Possible reasons why HF was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism include the difference in current standard therapeutic drugs for HF compared with the 1990s, HF being a stronger risk factor for all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths rather than for thromboembolism,
264
 and the severity or duration of HF not taken into consideration.
265
, 
266
 In a subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial,
265
 severe HF with NYHA class III or IV was a significant risk factor for thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.88). In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267
 Therefore, the definition of hypertension in the CHADS2 score includes a history of hypertension in addition to the criteria of hypertension in those days of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg. Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,
269
 and the ARISTOTLE trial.
270
 In contrast, in a subanalysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
271
 neither hypertension (including its history and/or under treatment) nor BP value at the time of enrollment was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, but the incidence of thromboembolism in the highest quartile of systolic BP (≥136 mmHg) at the time closest to the event was significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile (<114 mmHg) (odds ratio 2.88, 95% CI 1.75–4.74). A subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry
272
 also showed that event rates in patients with hypertension were comparable to those without hypertension, but the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with a baseline systolic BP ≥150 mmHg was significantly higher than in those with adequate BP control.

Given that patients with inadequate BP control have consistently indicated high event rates in all studies,
269
, 
270
, 
271
, 
272
, 
273
 including trials in which hypertension was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism,
271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271
, 
275
 The reason can be speculated as the control status of blood glucose levels or the recent progression of oral hypoglycemic agents not being reflected in these results, but the precise causes remain unknown. However, HRs were >1.0 in most studies.
249
, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

In the latest vision of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 cardiomyopathy, advanced age (65–74 years), and vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease) were listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy.

Advanced age (65–74 years) was a significant risk factor for stroke in the AFI
253
 and the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study.
249
 In the 2016 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
280
 patients aged ≥65 years are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy, regardless of other risk factors. It named the score as “CHADS65” due to attaching importance to age ≥65 years. However, it has not been identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in Japan, even though the HR was slightly high at 1.0–1.3.
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “vascular disease” including prior myocardial infarction,
253
 aortic plaque,
281
 and peripheral arterial disease
282
 was identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism and listed in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 these factors were not a significant risk for thromboembolism in Japanese patients.
252
, 
271
, 
275

In patients with “cardiomyopathy,” the coagulation system is often activated.
283
, 
284
 In some cohort studies of Japanese patients with NVAF, cardiomyopathy, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was reportedly an independent risk factor for stroke.
284
, 
285

Because being “female”
249
, 
253
 had proved not to be a solo risk factor in AF patients aged <65 years without other organic diseases,
247
, 
274
, 
286
 it was deleted in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2
 Subsequently, given that female sex was not detected as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in subanalyses of both the J‐RHYTHM Registry
287
 and the Fushimi AF Registry,
288
 it was determined not to describe this as a solo risk factor in this guideline. It seems reasonable that female sex is dealt with as a modifier of other risk factors independent of sex.
289
, 
290

“Thyrotoxicosis” is not considered as a risk factor for thromboembolism, as described in the previous version of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 because thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism has not been sufficiently validated as a solo risk factor for thromboembolism.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,
291
, 
292
 the risk for thromboembolism in patients with persistent or permanent AF is reportedly higher than that in those with paroxysmal AF in subanalyses of phase III trials using DOACs
293
, 
294
, 
295
, 
296
 and the Fushimi AF Registry.
297
 In addition, the risk of adverse events was transiently elevated during the progression period from paroxysmal to sustained AF.
298

Among the findings of echocardiography, LV systolic function (LV fractional shortening <25%),
255
, 
257
 left atrial (LA) dysfunction,
299
 and LA diameter (>45 mm) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),
275
 and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (so‐called smoke‐like or moyamoya echo) in the LA, LA appendage thrombus, and peak LA appendage flow velocity (<20 cm/s)
281
 on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been reported as risk factors for thromboembolism.

“Low body weight (BW) or low body mass index (BMI)” and “renal dysfunction” often lead to issues in patients with AF, especially in elderly patients. In the Fushimi AF Registry, BW ≤50 kg
300
 and creatinine clearance (CCr) <30 mL/min
301
 were significant risk factors for thromboembolism. In contrast, in the J‐RHYTHM Registry, BMI <18.5 kg/m2 302 and CCr <30 mL/min
303
 were stronger risk factors for all‐cause death than for thromboembolism. Factors not included in the CHADS2 score in subanalyses of both registries are shown in Table 33.

Risk Factors for Thromboembolism Not Included in the CHADS2 Score

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; BMI, body mass index; BW, body weight; CCr, creatinine clearance; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LAD, left atrial diameter; OR, odds ratio.

Accordingly to these AF registry studies in Japan, in the present guideline persistent or permanent AF, low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction, and LA diameter (>45 mm) are newly listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy (Figure 12), in addition to cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), and vascular disease.

Anticoagulation therapy in AF. *

Bioprosthetic values are included in non‐valvular AF. *2Regarding anticoagulation according to renal function, see “3.2.3 Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants” and Table 36. *3Regarding target INR 1.6–2.6 in non‐valvular AF, INR close to 2.0 is recommended as possible. INR 2.0–3.0 may be considered in high‐risk patients aged <70 years with a history of stroke or CHADS2 score ≥3. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The predictive ability of a risk score for events is generally evaluated using the c‐statistic (or c‐index).
304
 C‐statistics of the schemas in the AFI and SPAF, which were used for derivations of the CHADS2 score, were 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, that in the NRAF used for validation was 0.82, which was higher than each of the values of the AFI or SPAF.
245
 Novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed by adding other factors such as the CHA2DS2‐VASc score,
248
 the R2CHADS2 score
305
 by adding renal dysfunction, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history) stroke risk score
306
 by adding biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], high‐sensitivity troponin T), and so on. However, because the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7, it is difficult to determine whether predictive ability has improved compared with that of the CHADS2 score.
245
 A validation study of the J‐RHYTHM Registry
289
 also demonstrated that the c‐statistic of either the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (0.595) or the CHA2DS2‐VA score (0.624), when female sex was removed, was not higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.638).

Approximately half of patients with NVAF correspond to a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1,
274
, 
307
 for which the effectiveness of warfarin has not been proven. The prevalence of patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 was reportedly 15.6% in the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
307
 and 11.2% in the Fushimi AF Registry.
308
 In patients with cerebral infarction, those with a CHADS2 score of 0 before the onset of stroke comprised 7.3% and were not necessarily rare in the SAMURAI‐NVAF.
309
 The CHADS2 score is limited for distinguishing low‐risk patients, but the CHA2DS2‐VASc score is thought to be useful to detect an especially true low‐risk one who may not require anticoagulation therapy.
310
, 
311
 It can be proposed that anticoagulation therapy is not needed for patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 0, except for females, who showed no risk for thromboembolism in Japan.
287
, 
288
, 
289

In patients with NVAF, risk assessment for bleeding is important for the determination of anticoagulation therapy and to prevent bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy.

The HAS‐BLED score (Table 34)
312
 was adopted in the ESC guidelines in 2010 as a risk score for predicting bleeding.
282
 Comparing to the HEMORR2HAGES score published in 2006,
313
 this score is able to evaluate bleeding risks more simply and accurately in the clinical setting.
314
 The incidence rates of major bleeding per 100 patient‐years in each HAS‐BLED score were reportedly 1.13 for a score of 0, 1.02 for 1, 1.88 for 2, 3.74 for 3, 8.70 for 4, and 12.50 for 5,
312
 and a high risk was defined as a score ≥3. Because hypertension, prior stroke, and advanced age were mutual factors in the CHADS2 score,
245
 high‐risk patients for bleeding are also at high risk for thromboembolism.
315
 However, note that the definitions of risk factors in the HAS‐BLED score differ from those in the CHADS2 score. In the HAS‐BLED score, hypertension is defined as uncontrolled in patients with systolic BP >160 mmHg and advanced age is defined as >65 years. Labile international normalized ratio (INR) assumed that patients receive warfarin. Although novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed, such as the ATRIA hemorrhagic risk score,
316
 simplified by omitting INR, the ORBIT score,
317
 and the ABC bleeding risk score by adding biomarkers,
318
 the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7 and thus, the predictive ability has not markedly improved.

HAS‐BLED Score

Maximum score: 9.

*1Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg. *2Abnormal renal function is defined as chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or serum creatinine ≥200 μmol/L (2.26 mg/dL). Abnormal liver function is defined as chronic hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant hepatic derangement (e.g., bilirubin >2×upper limit of normal, in association with AST/ALT/ALP >3×upper limit normal). *3Bleeding refers to previous bleeding history and/or predisposition to bleeding (e.g., bleeding diathesis, anemia). *4Labile INR refers to unstable/high INR or poor time in therapeutic range (i.e., <60%). *5Drugs/alcohol use refers to concomitant use of drugs, such as antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or alcohol abuse.

Abbreviation: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio.

In actual clinical practice, especially during anticoagulation therapy, it is important to assess bleeding risks using the “major risk factors for bleeding” as listed below since the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 and to control those factors suitable for intervention among the “factors related to intracranial hemorrhage” also listed below.

According to the results from a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial,
319
 a post marketing surveillance of dabigatran,
320
 and some domestic AF registry studies,
321
, 
322
 older age (≥75 years), low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), and antiplatelet use are major risk factors for bleeding during anticoagulation therapy. In patients receiving dabigatran, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and concomitant use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors are also risk factors for major bleeding (HR ≥3).
320
 In the present guideline, “uncontrolled hypertension” has been newly added as a major risk factor, based on results from the ROCKET AF trial,
269
 ARISTOTLE trial,
270
 and subanalyses of the Japanese AF registry studies.
271
, 
272
 Physicians should watch for critical bleeding complications in these high‐risk patients regardless of the anticoagulant used.

In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, age, prior stroke or TIA, use of aspirin or warfarin, and not being Caucasian were identified as factors related to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
323
 To date, hypertension, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, East Asian ethnicity, hypocholesterolemia, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, advanced age, prior cerebral infarction, and cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been identified as risk factors related to the development of ICH. Hypertension, prior cerebral infarction, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, hyperglycemia, and antithrombotic therapy were reportedly predisposing factors for enlargement of the ICH.
324
, 
325
, 
326
 To prevent the incidence of ICH, the use of DOACs with a low risk for ICH, adequate control of BP and blood glucose levels, abstention from smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and avoiding antiplatelet use could be recommended.
238
, 
327

In actual clinical practice, it is crucial to assess the risks for both thromboembolism and bleeding in individual patients and to select treatments that lead to a net clinical benefit
329
 based on a consideration of the risks and benefits.

A direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran,
260
 and factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban,
261
 apixaban,
262
 and edoxaban
263
 have been approved in Japan as oral anticoagulants with indications for prevention of ischemic stroke in AF, and are now available in daily clinical practice. These were first named as “new oral anticoagulants”, but have been called with several different names in contrast with VKA.
22
 Here, we call them DOACs.
330

DOACs have several advantages compared with warfarin, including fixed dosing, no need for regular blood sampling for dose adjustment, low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), less frequency of interactions with food and other drugs, rapid onset of action, and relatively short half‐life, all of which accordingly lead to no need or shortening of heparin replacement in the perioperative period. On the other hand, DOACs have several disadvantages, including a contraindication in severe renal dysfunction, rapid offset of action if a dose is missed, due to their short half‐life, no adequate measures for severe bleeding under anticoagulation therapy, and increased cost burden by patients. Among these, measures for severe bleeding have been partially established due to the recent development of antidotes for DOACs
331

332

333
, 
334
, 
335
 (see Section 3.6).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Anticoagulation for AF

*It has been reported that the threshold TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC).
359
 However, the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CCr, creatinine clearance; COR, class of recommendation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; NVAF, non‐valvular atrial fibrillation; PT‐INR, prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio; TTR, time in therapeutic range.

Selection of DOACs for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation According to Renal Function

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; HD, hemodialysis.

When oral anticoagulation is started in a patient with AF who is indicated for a DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) among patients with normal renal function to mild renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [CCr] ≥30 mL/min), a DOAC is recommended as the first choice in preference to a VKA,
21
 because of the convenience of drug prescription, stability of drug effects, low frequency of interactions with foods and other drugs, and the low incidence of ICH. The efficaciousness and safety of DOACs have been reported to be equal or superior to warfarin in randomized clinical trials with both Asian (including Japanese) and non‐Asian subjects or in observational studies with Japanese.
346
, 
348
, 
349
, 
360
, 
361
, 
362

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 Meanwhile, small‐sized studies of DOAC usage in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have accumulated.
240
, 
241
, 
242
 However, during the 3 months after valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended, even in patients with sinus rhythm,
363
 and studies of AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have excluded this time period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

DOACs are contraindicated for patients with severe renal dysfunction (CCr <30 mL/min for dabigatran, and CCr <15 mL/min for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban)
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 (Table 37). Therefore, in AF patients with CCr <15 mL/min, warfarin is the only anticoagulant that can be selected for prevention of ischemic stroke. However, warfarin has a relative contraindication for patients with severe renal impairment on the package insert.
364
 The bleeding risk with warfarin usage in AF patients with severe renal impairment is extremely high, which may offset the merit of preventing ischemic stroke.
365

Dosage and Administration of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation

•CCr <50 mL/min•P‐glycoprotein inhibitors

•Age ≥70 years•History of gastrointestinal bleeding (for dabigatran, dose reduction is considered, but not required)

2 of the following:

•Serum Cr ≥1.5 mg/dL

•Age ≥80 years•Body weight ≤60 kg

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance.

When anticoagulation is considered for patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), the indication should be carefully considered. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy recommends that administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication because it increases not only bleeding events but also thromboembolic events.
366
 The present guidelines also recommend that the administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication. However, in daily clinical practice, warfarin is widely used in the perioperative period of catheter ablation, in patients with mechanical valves, or in patients who need secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the present guidelines recommend that the administration of warfarin be considered for such cases, even for patients on maintenance HD.

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin but not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 In the present guidelines, AF with a history of valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is included as NVAF, which is indicated for DOAC usage. However, during the 3 months after a valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended even in patients with sinus rhythm
363
 and, meanwhile, studies evaluating the efficaciousness and safety of DOACs in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves
240
, 
241
, 
242
 excluded this period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

The differences in the pharmacological profiles of the DOACs are shown in Table 37.
367
 Several reviews have proposed flow charts for selection of DOACs based on their pharmacokinetic profiles, including metabolic pathways (renal excretion, hepatic excretion, and intestinal excretion) and number of doses, and the results of the subanalyses of phase III studies divided by the various patient backgrounds.
367
, 
368
, 
369
, 
370
 Of note, a review
367
 described Asian subanalyses including Japanese or a clinical trial with Japanese patients.
346
, 
348
, 
349
 However, although such flow charts may be useful for daily clinical practice, they cannot be regarded as absolute methods of choice because there have been no clinical trials that have directly compared among the DOACs.

It is essential to use DOACs with the dose and administration indicated in the package inserts (Tables 7 and 37), which have been determined through multiple clinical trials considering the characteristic pharmacokinetics for each DOAC. Moreover, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for stroke prevention by DOACs with on‐label dosing that are equal or superior to those of warfarin.
337

In daily clinical practice in Japan, there are more AF patients who are applicable for the dose reduction criteria of DOACs compared with Western countries due to high age and low body weight. Therefore, it is an issue in Japan whether the appropriateness of on‐label dosing may not be sufficiently validated in AF patients who are either older age or have mild to severe renal dysfunction; in such patients, evidence that verifies the appropriateness of on‐label dosing needs to accumulate. In the J‐ELD AF registry,
371
 which registered ∼3,000 Japanese elderly AF patients (≥75 years) under treatment with on‐label dosing of apixaban demonstrated similar efficiency and safety between the standard dose (n=1,284) and the reduced dose (n=1,747).

During warfarin administration, the intensity of anticoagulation effect is measured by the prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio (PT‐INR) and according to the PT‐INR, the dose of warfarin should be adjusted. In the JCS guidelines updated in 2013,
2
 the target range of PT‐INR was recommended as 1.6–2.6 for elderly patients (age ≥70 years)
353
 and 2.0–3.0 for younger patients (age <70 years). However, several reports from multicenter cohorts in Japan have demonstrated that clinicians targeted the PT‐INR range of 1.6–2.6, even in younger patients, presumably due to a fear of bleeding events.
307
, 
372

In the nationwide multicenter cohort of the J‐RHYTHM Registry, optimal PT‐INR under warfarin therapy was investigated using ∼8,000 AF patients. In that analysis, PT‐INR 1.6–2.6 was determined as the range in which both the risk of thromboembolism and major bleeding became minimal, regardless of elderly or younger patients.
350
, 
351
, 
352

Meanwhile, in studies of Japanese AF patients with acute ischemic stroke, the severity and prognosis after ischemic stroke according to PT‐INR at the time of the occurrence of ischemic stroke were evaluated.
354
, 
355
 In those studies, various measurements differed according to the PT‐INR, including the size of the infarction and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at the time of occurrence, and the severity of neural dysfunction or the prognosis of systemic function after ischemic stroke. In patients with PT‐INR 1.6–2.0, the measurements were similar to those with PT‐INR <1.6. Meanwhile, in patients with PT‐INR ≥2.0, the infarct size was small and the functional prognosis was relatively good.

Based on this evidence, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients without a history of ischemic stroke and having low thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≤2 points), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients. For this target range, the attending physician should aim to attain the middle (PT‐INR 2.0), but not the lower (1.6 or 1.7) value.

Meanwhile, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients with a history of ischemic stroke or having high thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≥3 points, or cancer patients), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years). Even in elderly patients, INR should be kept ≥2.0 as much as possible unless it threatens the safety for bleeding events.

As such, the present guidelines separate the optimal target range of warfarin therapy into primary prevention and secondary prevention: (i) in the former, the target range is 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients, and (ii) in the latter, the target range is 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years), which follows the target range in the previous guidelines.

The time in therapeutic range (TTR) is the measurement that calculates the percentage of time in which the PT‐INR under warfarin treatment is controlled within the target range.
374
 The TTR should be kept as high as possible. Although it has been reported that the threshold of TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC),
359
 the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and the thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

In the SAMURAI‐AF registry, which registered AF patients with a history of ischemic stroke, patients with optimal PT‐INR at the time of occurrence of ischemic stroke had a double risk of recurrence.
376
 In such cases, the patients may have a potential thrombophilia such as malignancy or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

DOACs have emerged as oral anticoagulants that do not need regular monitoring. Actually, in phase III trials, DOACs without regular monitoring showed similar efficacy and safety compared with warfarin with regular monitoring.

 However, it is recommended to measure the anticoagulation intensity of DOACs in high‐risk patients such as elderly patients, patients with renal dysfunction, and in patients who have experienced thromboembolism or bleeding events. However, it has not been well established how to interpret or how to respond to the results of the anticoagulation tests measured in daily clinical practice. Therefore, difficult cases should be referred to experts who have extensive experience with the prescription of DOACs (Table 38,

Average Plasma Concentration and Response of Coagulation Tests for DOACs

Each DOAC has its own criteria of contraindication determined by renal function (Tables 36 and 37). Moreover, to determine the dose of DOACs, measurement of renal function is mandatory. In consideration of the pathogenesis or patient characteristics that may potentially decrease the coagulation activity (e.g., hemophilia,
356
 blood type O,
357
 etc.), a coagulation test before starting DOACs is encouraged. In hemophilia, the judgement for starting DOACs is based on the level of coagulation activity.
356

The bleeding complications after starting DOACs are concentrated in the first 3 months, but especially in the first month. Therefore, for early detection of bleeding, it is useful to check the temporal change in hemoglobin in elderly patients or patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also recommended to check changes in renal or liver function.

The 90% intervals of the distribution of the plasma concentration of DOACs at peak and trough in AF patients are shown in Table 38.
330
, 
377
, 
378
, 
379
, 
380
 The 90% intervals are known as the “on therapy range”,
381
, 
382
 which can indicate the optimal range of the plasma concentration of DOACs used in daily clinical practice. When the plasma concentration of the DOAC exceeds the 90% intervals, the bleeding risk may significantly increase.
383
, 
384
 Therefore, a coagulation test to measure the intensity of anticoagulation in the early phase after starting a DOAC is recommended. For this purpose, the hemoclot thrombin inhibitory assay (HTI) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are used for direct thrombin inhibitors, whereas the anti‐Xa assay (AXA) and prothrombin time (PT) are used for factor Xa inhibitors. However, measurement of PT for factor Xa inhibitors cannot be fully encouraged due to the wide variation in response according to the reagents used and the targeted factor Xa inhibitor.

When the prescription of DOACs continues for more than a few years, renal function gradually decreases over time.
385
 Therefore, measurement of renal function at least once per year is recommended.
330
, 
358
 Moreover, as most DOACs have hepatic metabolism, liver function should also be measured. For early detection of subclinical gastrointestinal bleeding, measurement of hemoglobin is also recommended. In elderly patients (≥75 years), blood testing at least once per 6 months is recommended. Moreover, in patients with CCr <60 mL/min, blood test once per X months (X=CCr/10) is recommended.

Two case–control studies reported that the risk of thromboembolic complication for cardioversion of AF without oral anticoagulation was 1–5%.
386
, 
387
 The risk is reduced by warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion.
388
, 
389
, 
390
 This anticoagulant regimen is applied for patients with AF ≥48 h duration or when the duration of AF is unknown. The duration of warfarin therapy is within the target range of PT‐INR; that is, we need more than 3 weeks before cardioversion if we start warfarin in naïve patients. The evidence of the safety of cardioversion of AF without anticoagulation in patients with AF duration <48 h is limited. Left atrial thrombus and thromboembolism can be induced by short‐term AF, but the necessity of anticoagulation is not determined.

In addition, post‐hoc analyses of a subset of patients undergoing cardioversion in phase 3 trials of approved DOACs,
391
, 
392
, 
393
 4 prospective RCTs,
395

 a cohort study
394
 and meta‐analyses
399
, 
400
, 
401
 have evaluated the safety and efficacy of DOACs for cardioversion as an alternative to warfarin. The results were consistent and supported the idea that DOACs are an alternative to warfarin for patients undergoing cardioversion. For naïve patients, DOACs may be better for reducing the time before cardioversion, because the DOACs are effective from the day of starting, whereas warfarin takes at least several days to reach its therapeutic range. For patients with AF that requires immediate cardioversion because of hemodynamic instability in such clinical settings as angina, acute coronary syndrome, shock, or pulmonary edema, we should do it (if the duration of AF >48 h, with heparin i.v.) and should start and continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks.

After cardioversion and the restoration of sinus rhythm, functional recovery of the left atrium and left atrial appendage delay (i.e., atrial stunning) may take more than a few weeks.
402
 Meta‐analysis of 32 studies concerning cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter demonstrated that 98% of thromboembolic events occurred in the 10 days after cardioversion.
403
 The decision about long‐term anticoagulation therapy (beyond 4 weeks) is based on relapse of AF, which includes paroxysmal and asymptomatic forms, thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk (Figure 13).

Anticoagulant therapy for cardioversion. *2,000–5,000 U unfractionated heparin i.v. (evidence for the dose is poor).

An alternative to waiting 3 weeks before cardioversion is to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to exclude thrombus. In patients with AF ≥48 h duration, a RCT comparing cardioversion with and without TEE was performed (ACUTE trial).
404
 The traditional arm (n=603) was without TEE and administered warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion. In the TEE arm (n=619), immediate cardioversion was performed after heparin i.v. if no thrombus was detected in the left atrium. If a thrombus was detected, warfarin therapy was performed for 3 weeks. Cardioversion was performed if no thrombus was detected after reevaluation of TEE. Warfarin was continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. The number of days before cardioversion was significantly short in the TEE arm (mean 3.0 days vs 30.6 days), whereas the success rate of cardioversion and the rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding were not significantly different at 8 weeks after cardioversion. These results showed that TEE is an acceptable screening procedure for cardioversion of AF.
404

Prospective randomized trials with DOACs and warfarin for cardioversion of AF (X‐VerT, ENSURE‐AF, XANTUS, and EMANATE) included a TEE arm and confirmed the efficacy and safety.
395

398
 If the risk of cerebral infarction is extremely high in patients with AF lasting <48 h, TEE is considered before cardioversion.

Cardioversion of atrial flutter also has the complication of cerebral infarction or systemic embolism, so anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or DOAC) should be applied as for AF before and after cardioversion.

Patients on anticoagulation therapy often undergo invasive procedures (e.g., examinations and treatments). Specific clinical departments that provide such invasive procedures face difficult decisions as to whether their patients need to be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulants during the perioperative period. Such decisions should be made on a patient‐by‐patient basis, taking several factors into account, such as the risk of thromboembolism, type of anticoagulant used, and the risk of bleeding associated with the particular invasive procedure to be performed. Physicians who are to perform such invasive procedures should consult with the clinic or hospital prescribing the anticoagulant to the patient to help decide whether the patient can be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulation therapy. Furthermore, they should also consult with the patient to explain the risks associated with interruption, specifically the risk of thromboembolism, and receive consent.

The categories of bleeding risks associated with invasive procedures performed across different specialties are shown in Table 39. In general, to prevent thromboembolism, interruption of anticoagulation therapy is not recommended for patients undergoing invasive procedures in which hemostasis is possible. For invasive procedures that require interruption of anticoagulation therapy, the period of interruption should be kept to a minimum and the treatment should be re‐initiated as soon as hemostasis is confirmed. The categories shown in Table 39 are based on standard invasive procedures; it should be noted that interruption may still be needed in high bleeding risk cases for procedures that are categorized as low risk of bleeding. It should also be noted that the guidelines are specific for elective invasive procedures and do not apply to emergency procedures. Recommendations and levels of evidence for continuation of anticoagulant therapy during invasive procedures are shown in Table 40.

Classification of Elective Surgical Interventions According to Bleeding Risk

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Continuation of Anticoagulant Therapy During Invasive Procedures

Safety of continuing oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin for patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures was shown in several RCTs,
407
, 
408
, 
409
, 
410
 and a meta‐analysis.
411
 In the meta‐analysis, perioperative continuation of warfarin was not associated with an increased risk for clinically significant bleeding or minor bleeding, compared with interrupting warfarin therapy. A review showed that approximately 1% of patients with warfarin therapy discontinued specifically for dental procedures had serious embolic complications (including deaths).
412
 Therefore, continuation of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin in patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures is recommended.

Evidence regarding oral anticoagulant therapy using DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is lacking. In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, there was no significant difference in the rates of periprocedural ischemic stroke or systemic embolism between patients receiving dabigatran and those receiving warfarin (0.5% for both), who required surgery, including dental procedures.
413
 A study from Japan regarding the risk of bleeding in patients receiving a DOAC or warfarin without cessation reported that postoperative bleeding occurred in 4 extractions (3.1%) among 128 patients receiving DOACs (all extractions in DOAC patients were performed 6–7 h after taking the DOAC), and in 23 (8.8%) among 262 patients receiving warfarin, and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups.
414
 Thus, continuation of DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is recommended, as with the recommendation for warfarin.

It is reported that the incidence rate of stroke was approximately 1% in AF patients with adjusted anticoagulation (including withholding, reversal, or changing dose) who underwent endoscopy.
415
 In prospective observational studies, there was no significant difference for post‐procedural bleeding following endoscopy between patients with discontinued and continued anticoagulant therapy.
416
, 
417
 Diagnostic endoscopic procedures without biopsy can potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy, and expert opinion suggests that diagnostic endoscopy with biopsy can also potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy with controlled therapeutic INR,
418
, 
419
 but definite evidence is lacking. heparin bridging therapy for endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk significantly increased the risk of post‐procedural bleeding.
420
, 
421

The Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society published “Guidelines for gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing antithrombotic treatment” in 2012,
422
, 
423
 and an Appendix including DOACs in 2017.
424
, 
425
 The guideline classified gastroenterological endoscopic examination and treatment procedures according to bleeding risk into 4 categories: (i) diagnostic gastroenterological endoscopic procedures without biopsy, (ii) endoscopic mucosal biopsy (excluding endoscopic ultrasonography‐guided fine‐needle aspiration), (iii) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with low bleeding risk, and (iv) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk. For category (i), withdrawal of warfarin or DOAC is not required. For categories (ii–iv), warfarin withdrawal is not required but it should be confirmed that the PT‐INR is within the therapeutic range. For patients receiving DOACs in category (ii) or (iii), DOAC withdrawal is not required, but performing the procedure outside the peak DOAC blood concentration estimated from the time of administration is recommended. Patients receiving DOACs in category (iv) should discontinue the DOAC on the morning of the procedure. Oral administration of DOAC may be resumed on the morning after the procedure.

Although there was no established evidence or standard management approach during surgery with high bleeding risk, discontinuation of warfarin therapy and heparin bridging has been performed empirically during the perioperative period.
426
, 
427
 However, the BRIDGE trial showed that the incidence of arterial thromboembolism was comparable between the no‐bridging group (0.4%) and the bridging group (0.3%), and the incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower in the no‐bridging group (1.3%) compared with the bridging group.
428
 Some observational studies reported the similar results to the BRIDGE trial.
429
, 
430
 Generally, routine heparin bridging is not needed for patients with AF who require an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective invasive procedure with high bleeding risk.

On the other hand, heparin bridging is recommended to be considered for valvular AF patients (mechanical valve or rheumatic mitral stenosis), or non‐valvular AF patients at very high thromboembolic risk, such as history of ischemic stroke within 3 months or extremely high CHADS2 score. Analyses developed from the BRIDGE trial showed bridging to only be beneficial for patients with HAS‐BLED scores ≤2 and with CHA2DS2‐VASc scores of ≥6 (presumed CHADS2 score of ≥4).
431

A subanalysis of the international multicenter phase III trials of each DOAC regarding perioperative events has been published.
413
, 
432
, 
433
, 
434
 Meta‐analysis of these studies showed no significant difference in the risks of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, and overall mortality at 30 days following surgery or procedure between perioperative interruption of DOAC and interruption of warfarin.
435

In the case of invasive procedures that carry a high risk for major bleeding, it is recommended to take the last DOAC dose ≥48 h before surgery.
330
 For patients on dabigatran with CCR ≥80 mL/min, the last administration should be taken ≥48 h, for those with CCR 50–79 mL/min it should be taken ≥72 h, and for those with CCR 30–49 mL/min it should be taken ≥96 h before surgery.

Perioperative heparin bridging is not recommended in patients who discontinued DOACs before surgery.
330
 In a substudy of the RE‐LY trial, with dabigatran interruption, bridging was associated with significantly higher incidence of major bleeding than no‐bridging, but for any thromboembolic events there was no difference between bridging and no‐bridging.
436
 In general, heparin bridging in not needed during the interruption of DOAC therapy, but it can be considered in patients at very high thromboembolic risk as described above.

Two RCTs are available regarding bridging anticoagulation using warfarin in patients who required cardiac implantable electronic device surgery.
437
, 
438
 They concluded that a strategy of bridging therapy at the time of device implantation markedly increased the incidence of clinically significant device‐pocket hematoma as compared with continued warfarin treatment, and thromboembolic complications were rare and did not differ significantly between bridging therapy and continued warfarin treatment. Additionally, device‐pocket hematoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of infection requiring hospitalization.
439

There are several observational studies that show continued DOAC treatment during device implantation surgery was not significantly associated with increased incidence of clinically relevant bleeding events.
440
, 
441
, 
442

Patients undergoing AF ablation have a high risk of bleeding and thromboembolism, requiring appropriate anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period. Large‐scale observational studies of AF ablation demonstrated that cardiac tamponade and perforation are common hemorrhagic complications, with the incidence ranging from 1.2% to 2.5% and from 0.9% to 1,5%, respectively.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 The Japanese Catheter Ablation Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (J‐CARAF), which included 8,319 cases, also reported similar incidence rates.
447
 Thus, although technical advancements are expected, it remains essential to consider the risk of hemorrhagic complications. The risk of thromboembolism is further increased in left atrial ablation, with 0.1–0.3% of patients developing cerebral infarction during the perioperative period.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 Collectively, appropriate management of anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period is essential.

A recent international expert consensus recommended that warfarin be administered uninterrupted.
448
 This recommendation is based on evidence from an RCT (COMPARE trial) demonstrating that the use of warfarin reduced the risk of hemorrhagic complications in addition to that of embolism.
449

Similarly, recent RCTs have generated additional evidence on the use of DOACs. By comparing dabigatran (RE‐CIRCUIT trial),
450
 rivaroxaban (VENTURE‐AF trial),
451
 apixaban (AXAFA‐AFNET 5 trial),
452
 and edoxaban (ELIMINATE‐AF trial)
453
 with uninterrupted warfarin, they found that the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted administration of DOACs during the perioperative period are equivalent or superior to those of warfarin in terms of the risk of embolism and hemorrhagic complications. However, these studies included relatively small numbers of patients. In addition, variations in trial design should be noted; these variations included the half‐life of each DOAC and when the last dose was administered prior to the procedure.

There are limited data on minimally interrupted DOAC therapy, in which administration is interrupted 1–2 times prior to the procedure. An RCT conducted in Japan (ABRIDGE‐J trial) compared minimally interrupted dabigatran and uninterrupted warfarin, and demonstrated that the risk of hemorrhage was higher in the warfarin group, but the risk of embolism was equivalent between groups.
454
 Another Japanese single‐center RCT compared uninterrupted and minimally interrupted DOAC, and reported no significant difference in the incidence of embolism or hemorrhagic complications among the 4 DOACs, suggesting that minimal interruption is acceptable.
455
 A recent multicenter study conducted across hospitals in the Kyushu region (KYU‐RABLE study) also demonstrated that uninterrupted administration of edoxaban during the perioperative period (immediately after the procedure on the day of the surgery) is effective and safe.
456

Many factors should be considered in order to select the appropriate DOAC, as well as to determine whether interruption is needed (and if so, for how long) during the perioperative period for patients undergoing AF ablation. These factors include the patient‐specific risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and differences in drug metabolism and route of excretion among DOACs, in addition to the availability of neutralizing agents such as idarucizumab for dabigatran
332
 and Andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors (unapproved, as of March 2020).
457
 The “2018 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias”
4
 should also be referred to.

The prevalence of the coexistence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported to be 8–15% in Japan,
307
, 
308
, 
362
, 
458
, 
459
 and these patients are encountered commonly in clinical practice. The JCS 2018 “Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome”
460
 and on “Revascularization of Stable Coronary Artery Disease”
461
 recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (P2Y12 inhibitor) after stent implantation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as class I/evidence level A. Therefore, in patients with AF concomitant with undergoing PCI, triple therapy defined as a DAPT plus an OAC for stroke prevention is needed. In 2019, the Academic Research Consortium proposed a consensus definition of patients at a high bleeding risk (HBR) among those undergoing PCI, which was based on a review of the available evidence. The use of OACs is fulfilled by the major criteria for HBR patients who are defined as having an annual incidence of bleeding events estimated to be >4%.
462
 Because the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy in these HBR patients would dramatically increase bleeding events, antithrombotic management focusing on the prevention of bleeding events is becoming the main trend worldwide.

The WOEST trial
463
 (n=573) was the first to test the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a VKA plus clopidogrel as a counterpart to the triple therapy of a VKA plus DAPT. Among the patients taking OACs and undergoing a PCI, dual therapy reduced the annual incidence of major bleeding more than the triple therapy, and surprisingly, the annual incidence of the composite cardiovascular events also lowered with the dual therapy. Regarding the benefit of VKA monotherapy as compared with dual therapy in AF patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), a nationwide Danish cohort registry provided insightful results that VKA monotherapy had a similar risk of a myocardial infarction/coronary death but decreased risk of serious bleeding events, as compared with dual therapy of a VKA plus aspirin or VKA plus clopidogrel.
464
 An open‐label randomized trial comparing an OAC alone (including four‐thirds of the patients taking warfarin and the remaining patients taking DOACs) and dual therapy with an OAC plus single antiplatelet in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI (OAC‐ALONE: Optimizing Antithrombotic Care in patients with AtriaL fibrillatiON and coronary stEnt study) was conducted in Japan.
465
 In that trial, there were no differences in the incidences of the primary endpoint (composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism) and major bleeding between the OAC alone therapy and dual therapy, which supported the results obtained from the nationwide Danish cohort study.
464

As DOACs are being increasingly used as an alternative to warfarin in clinical practice,
362
 the clinical evidence for DOACs in antithrombotic therapy management among AF patients undergoing PCI is becoming established. The PIONEER PCI trial
466
 compared the primary safety outcome and the occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke) between dual therapy with rivaroxaban 15 mg plus P2Y12 inhibitor (n=709) for 12 months and triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT adjusted for 1, 6, or 12 months (n=706). Similar to the WOEST trial, the dual therapy had a lower risk of clinically significant bleeding, but the rate of a major adverse cardiovascular event was similar between the dual and triple therapies. The RE‐DUAL PCI trial
467
 (n=2,725), which compared dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) over 12 months and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) with warfarin‐based triple therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (for 1–3 months), showed a similar result that the dual therapy had a lower risk of bleeding and was noninferior to the triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events. In the AUGUSTUS trial,
468
 4,614 AF patients who underwent PCI with a P2Y12 inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive apixaban or VKA and aspirin or a matching placebo for 6 months. The P2Y12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than the regimens that included VKA, aspirin, or both. The ENTRUST trial
469
 included 1,506 AF patients who had undergone PCI and were randomly assigned to either edoxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or VKA plus DAPT (for 1–12 months). The trial also showed consistent results of a bleeding risk reduction and an equivalent ischemic risk of the dual therapy as for the triple therapy. Although these 4 trials established the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor as compared with a warfarin‐based triple therapy in AF patients with CAD, the endpoints in the trials were only evaluated during a limited duration of 1 year after PCI.

Regarding the prognostic effect of DOACs in patients with stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI, the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic events with rivaroxaban in patiEnts with stable coronary artery disease Study) trial was published in 2019.
470
 This multicenter, open‐label trial conducted in Japan randomly assigned 2,236 patients with AF who had undergone PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban or a combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination‐therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, and surprisingly, the risk of the primary efficacy endpoint (composite of a stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause) was reduced by 28%, and was statistically noninferior to the combination therapy. Similar data, even for DOACs, supporting the results from the nationwide Danish registry
464
 and OAC‐ALONE trial
465
 were shown by this trial in Japan.

On the other hand, to explore the optimal duration of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy, the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial,
471
 a randomized open‐label study, was conducted. The result was that 6 weeks of triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after PCI in patients receiving an OAC was noninferior to 6 months of a triple therapy with respect to ischemic events and major bleeding events. Furthermore, in the WOEST trial
463
 and the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 as described above, the patients assigned to the dual therapy group were de‐escalated from a triple therapy to a dual therapy with a DOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor by cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase (maximum 2 weeks in the AUGUSTUS trial) after the PCI, which strongly supported the clinical acceptability of an early termination of aspirin after PCI. Meta‐analyses have also suggested that aspirin should be terminated early after PCI.
472
, 
473
 On the basis of these data in this field described above, this guideline recommends that the timing of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and clopidogrel should be within 2 weeks after PCI (Figure 14). The present European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines
21
, 
330
,

 also consider dual therapy with clopidogrel and an OAC immediately after PCI as an alternative to triple therapy in those for whom the bleeding risk overweighs the ischemic risk, and dual therapy (aspirin is only used in the periprocedural phase after PCI) is recommended as a default strategy in the North American guidelines.

Recommended choice and duration of antithrombic therapy in atrial fibrillation concomitant with ischemic heart disease. *1Short duration of 6 months of dual therapy can be considered in patients with a very high bleeding risk. *2Continuation of dual therapy with an OAC and aspirin (or P2Y12 inhibitor) for longer than 12 months can be considered in patients with a very high thromboembolic risk. PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, OAC, oral anticoagulant.

Based on the increased evidence in this field as described above, this guideline provides a flow chart (Figure 14) and Table 41 for antithrombic management in AF patients with concomitant IHD.

 The P2Y12 inhibitors, ticagrelor and prasugrel (loading dose, 60 mg; maintenance dose, 10 mg in other countries) have been suggested to have a high bleeding risk.
482
, 
483
, 
484
 However, the approved dose of prasugrel was reduced (loading dose, 20 mg; maintenance dose, 3.75 mg) because East Asian individuals have a higher bleeding risk than Western individuals. Therefore, this guideline allows for the use of prasugrel when considering its use in clinical practice in Japan. While balancing between the thromboembolic‐vs.‐bleeding risk, a default strategy is de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor by ceasing aspirin within 2 weeks after PCI.

 More than half of the patients enrolled in the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials were compromised by acute coronary syndrome (ACS),

469
 and a subanalysis revealed a consistent benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and clopidogrel over a warfarin‐based triple therapy, regardless of ACS or stable CAD. Therefore, dual therapy is recommended as a default strategy even in patients with ACS. Nevertheless, the subanalysis of the AUGUSTUS trial demonstrated that a stent thrombosis at 1 month was numerically but not significantly lower in the triple therapy group with concomitant use of aspirin than in the dual therapy group after early cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase after PCI,
485
 implying the need for caution in patients with a very high risk of stent‐driven ischemic events. Therefore, triple therapy for longer than 1 month and up to 3 months by physicians’ discretion is acceptable in patients with a very high stent‐driven ischemic risk, as shown in Table 42.

 In contrast, triple therapy for longer than 1 month cannot be recommended in patients with a high bleeding risk (class III/evidence level B).

 In limited numbers of patients with a very high thromboembolic risk, dual therapy with an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor (or aspirin) for longer than 1 year can be considered,

The 4 phase III DOAC trials in AF patients included stable CAD in one‐third of the total patients and ACS in 15–20%,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 and reported the efficacy and safety of DOACs over warfarin even in those patients. The persistent benefit of DOACs over warfarin was observed in a database analysis, meta‐analysis, and registry in Japan.
479
, 
480
, 
481
 Furthermore, the AUGUSTUS trial
468
 indicated that apixaban had a similar efficacy and in particular, a bleeding risk, superior to warfarin. For these reasons, a DOAC should be used unless the patient has a contraindication (class I/evidence level A).
461
, 
474
, 
475
 Regarding the dose of each DOAC in the combined use as antiplatelet therapy, the lowest dose established for stroke prevention in the phase III DOAC AF trials should be used (class IIa/evidence level A).
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 When warfarin is used in combination with antiplatelet therapy, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be maintained in the lower part of the recommended target range and the time in the therapeutic range should be > 65% (class IIb/evidence level C). This is because significant increases in bleeding events were evident with VKA‐based triple therapy with a target INR of 2.0–3.0, as reported in the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 and the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial.
471

An observational study with 4,009 patients undergoing antithrombotic therapy in Japan showed that the incidence of major bleeding with single antiplatelet, multiple antiplatelet agents, warfarin, and warfarin plus antiplatelet agents was 1.2%/year, 2.0%/year, 2.1%/year, and 3.6%/year, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.3%/year, 0.6%/year, 0.6%/year, and 1.0%/year, respectively.
327
 We need to recognize that serious bleeding can occur at a certain frequency during antithrombotic therapy, and that the risk increases with the concomitant use of antithrombotic agents. We also need to know how to manage hemorrhagic complications (Figure 15, Table 43).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for the Management of Active Bleeding

Abbreviation: COR, class of recommendation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; FFP, fresh frozen plasma; GOR, grade of recommendation; INR, international normalized ratio; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; PCC, prothrombin complex concentrate; PT, prothrombin time.

In the case of mild bleeding, we should consider correct continuation of antithrombotic therapy rather than discontinuation without careful consideration. For moderate‐to‐severe bleeding, it is recommended to discontinue the antithrombotic agents, stop the bleeding, stabilize circulatory dynamics with appropriate drip infusion, and lower the blood pressure during intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (recommended class I).
487
, 
488
, 
489
 Administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K (recommended class I), fresh frozen plasma (FFP, recommended class I) and recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) are recommended for the purpose of suppressing bleeding tendency during warfarin therapy and acute severe bleeding, or for urgent surgery/procedures where serious bleeding is anticipated.
490
, 
491
, 
492
, 
493
, 
494
, 
495
, 
496

The administration of both PCC and vitamin K has the fastest and surest effect.
497
, 
498
, 
499
 Randomized controlled trials of PCC + vitamin K versus FFP + vitamin K performed in patients on warfarin treatment who had severe bleeding or suddenly needed invasive medical treatment showed a non‐inferiority of the hemostatic effect of PCC + vitamin K against FFP + vitamin K.
497
, 
498
 In addition, PCC had a shorter administration time, a shorter time to hemostasis, and a smaller volume than that of FFP. From the standpoint of pasteurization and nanofiltration, PCC is superior to FFP for safety.

The administration dose of the PCC is determined according to the INR value and body weight. PCC of 25 IU/kg (max. dose of 2,500 IU) for INR of ≥2.0 and <4.0, 35 IU/kg (max. dose of 3,500 IU) for INR of ≥4.0 and <6.0, or 50 IU/kg (max. dose of 5,000 IU) for INR ≥6.0 should be administered. Usage and dosage for patients with INR <2.0 have not been officially recognized.

However, a pharmacometric simulation model analysis showing the relationship of INR and coagulation factor activity using the PCC Phase III study data
497
, 
498
, 
499
 showed that PCC doses of 25 IU/kg, 20 IU/kg, and 15 IU/kg were needed at INRs 3.1, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively, to achieve both coagulant factor II and X activities of ≥50% in more than 80% of patients at 30 min after administration of PCC.
500
 Therefore, if urgent correction is required in a patient with INR <2.0, a dose of 20 IU/kg for INR >1.6 and 15 IU/kg for INR ≤ 1.6 might be considered.

In addition, studies in a small number of cases have been reported suggesting the usefulness of administering 15–25 IU/kg of PCC for INR <2.0.
501
, 
502
 For correction during heparin therapy, dilute protamine sulfate is slowly infused.
503

The incidence of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy is equivalent or less than that of warfarin. For bleeding, in addition to hemostasis treatment, we should consider discontinuation of DOACs according to the severity of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy and promotion of diuresis excretion by appropriate infusion. Administration of PCC (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) and that of recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) can be considered as measures against bleeding during DOAC therapy, but they have not been examined sufficiently. Dabigatran may be removed by hemodialysis because it has a low binding rate to proteins in the blood. For bleeding early after oral administration of each DOAC, gastric lavage or oral administration of activated charcoal may be considered to suppress the increase in blood concentration by suppressing absorption from the digestive tract.
504

Idarucizumab, a specific neutralizing antibody, is used during dabigatran therapy. To suppress the bleeding tendency during dabigatran therapy with acute severe bleeding or for urgent surgery/procedures in which significant bleeding is anticipated, idarucizumab is administered within 24 h after the last oral dose of dabigatran.
332
 Because a high blood concentration may be sustained in patients with renal dysfunction or oral administration of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors, we may consider administration of idarucizumab for up to 48 h in those patients. Regardless of the dose or time after oral administration, 5 g idarucizumab (two 2.5 g vials) is administered. The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is rapidly and completely neutralized within 1 min after the administration and the neutralizing effect is sustained for 24 h.

Dabigatran can be administered 24 h after the administration of idarucizumab, and other anticoagulants can be administered within 24 h. Neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran may induce a hypercoagulable state prior to the introduction of dabigatran, but idarucizumab itself has no effect on coagulation or fibrinolysis. Therefore, if cerebral infarction develops in a patient on dabigatran treatment, there is an option to administer intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt‐PA) after neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran by administration of idarucizumab.
505

If it is necessary to correct the effects of factor Xa inhibitors, administration of an antidote, Andexanet alfa (unapproved at January 2022) or ciraparantag (unapproved at January 2022) may be considered.
457
, 
506
 Andexanet alfa is a decoy protein of coagulation factor Xa, and the corrective effect can be sustained by intravenous infusion after a fixed amount of intravenous injection.
457
 The dose varies depending on the type of factor Xa inhibitor. In the USA, it was approved as an antidote for rivaroxaban and apixaban in May 2018. In Japan, it is under development as an antidote for all factor Xa inhibitors. Ciraparantag is a low molecular weight compound that has attracted attention because it is suggested to have a neutralizing effect on not only factor Xa inhibitors but also thrombin inhibitors and heparin, but its development has been delayed.
506

If resumption of anticoagulant therapy is indicated, considering the source of hemorrhage and the state of hemostasis after hemostatic treatment, surgery, or other invasive procedure, it should be resumed as soon as possible to prevent thromboembolism.

Treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF) include pharmacotherapy and catheter ablation. Pharmacotherapy is a priority, but may be considered positively in patients for whom catheter ablation is indicated. Anticoagulant therapy should be firstly considered as pharmacotherapy for AF. As the next step, rhythm control therapy and rate control therapy were previously recommended as similar, but in recent years, rate control therapy has become a higher priority than rhythm control therapy. Clinical trials such as AFFIRM
507
 and RACE
508
 conducted in Western countries, and J‐RHYTHM
509
 in Japan showed that rhythm control therapy and rate control therapy did not differ in hospitalization for all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and aggravation of heart failure (HF). Similar results were obtained in AF‐CHF
229
 with AF associated with HF.

Based on this evidence, in the European guideline,
21
 easy rate control therapy is ranked high, but rhythm control therapy is considered in patients with strong subjective symptoms or patients with impaired quality of life (QOL).

Drugs used to control heart rate include β‐blockers, digitalis, non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, and the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone. Among them, β‐blockers have added value, such as a protective effect on the myocardium and improvement of life prognosis, and can be expected to improve symptoms by relaxing sympathetic tone. Therefore, β‐blockers are widely used, compared with other drugs, in Europe, the USA, and Japan
509
,

 (Table 44, Figure 16).

Treatment flowchart of rate control therapy for tachycardiac AF. AF, atrial fibrillation; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.

Intravenous drugs are mainly used for urgently controlling the heart rate during the acute phase. β‐blockers, digitalis, and amiodarone are used.

Intravenous β‐blockers include landiolol, esmolol, and propranolol, but usage of the ultra‐short‐acting β
1‐blocker landiolol is high in Japan. JL‐KNIGHT,
511
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF/atrial flutter after thoracic surgery, showed that the heart rate inhibitory effect and recovery of sinus rhythm were superior to that of diltiazem. J‐Land,
512
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF and impaired cardiac function (complicated with HF), showed that heart rate‐suppressing effect of landiolol was superior to that of digoxin, and there was no difference in the occurrence of side effects. It was shown that the effectiveness of landiolol as a heart rate regulator can be expected for tachycardiac AF associated with HF, but it has been shown to be less effective in patients with extremely impaired cardiac function.
513
, 
514
 Moreover, the tachycardia suppression effect on atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia cannot be expected as much as for AF.
515

When landiolol is used in patients with low cardiac function, the dose is gradually increased from a small dosage (1 μg/kg/min; max. dosage 10 μg/kg/min). If the effect is insufficient, add digitalis. Intravenous non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists (diltiazem and verapamil) are contraindicated for tachycardiac AF associated with low cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%.

Amiodarone may be used when attempting to control the heart rate of tachycardiac AF while considering defibrillation (not covered by insurance).

The first‐line treatment is a β‐blocker. In a clinical study that verified the prognostic effect of β‐blockers and digitalis, β‐blockers improved the prognosis of patients regardless of the degree of cardiac function, but digitalis did not show such an effect.
516

Although there are many types of oral β‐blockers, those without intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA: bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, etc.) are used for rate control therapy. MAIN‐AF
517
 for bisoprolol and AF carvedilol
518
 for carvedilol demonstrated a heart rate‐reducing effect in patients with persistent or chronic AF. A bisoprolol patch was also recently approved by BISONO‐AF
519
 because of its heart rate‐reducing effect in patients with AF. In a comparison of bisoprolol and carvedilol, bisoprolol, which has a high cardiac (β
1) selectivity, has a stronger heart rate inhibitory effect. Therefore, when used in elderly patients with HF, it is necessary to pay attention to severe bradycardia as a side effect, as shown in CIBIS‐ELD.
520

In a meta‐analysis of an old clinical trial that verified the efficacy of β‐blockers in patients with HF,
521
 it was reported that the effect of β‐blockers on prognosis was not observed in patients with AF. However, recent clinical studies reported thereafter that β‐blockers have a prognostic effect on AF with HF.
522
, 
523
, 
524
 The current usage of β‐blockers seems to have a prognostic effect on AF associated with HF.

Verapamil and diltiazem, which are non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, are used in patients with tachycardiac AF because they have not only antihypertensive effects but also relatively strong bradycardiac effects due to atrioventricular conduction inhibition. However, because they also have a negative inotropic effect, their use is limited to cases where cardiac function is maintained. Negative inotropic effects are more likely to occur in patients with impaired cardiac function, and verapamil is stronger than diltiazem.

In the guidelines in Japan and Europe,
21
, 
250
 non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists are contraindicated in patients with HF and impaired cardiac function (LVEF <40%). Therefore, when selecting a non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, it is necessary to check cardiac function by echocardiography or blood test (BNP level).

Digoxin or methyldigoxin is used. Digitalis also has a cardiotonic action, and is often used in patients with tachycardiac AF with impaired cardiac function. However, as shown in the European guidelines,
21
 it is not used as a first‐line drug, but as a second‐line drug. Digitalis has a heart rate‐reducing effect at rest, but a weaker effect on exercise. The J‐RHYTHM Registry subanalysis showed that digitalis alone had no effect on the prognosis,
525
 but it has been shown in the USA and Europe that mortality increases with long‐term use in patients with AF.
516
, 
526
, 
527
 Therefore, long‐term use should be avoided as much as possible.

Because both digoxin and methyldigoxin are drugs excreted by the kidney, administration in patients with impaired renal function may result in digitalis toxicity. It is necessary to periodically measure the blood concentration and adjust the dosage for the optimum concentration.

The target heart rate is set in patients with persistent or permanent AF. Traditionally, the heart rate of AF was stated as <80 beats/min at rest and <110 (115) beast/min during exercise. In RACE II,
528
 it was verified in patients with permanent AF whether or not strict heart rate control should be performed. As a result, there is no difference in event rate between strict rate control therapy (resting heart rate <80 beats/min) and lenient rate control therapy (resting heart rate <110 beats/min). Therefore, it is important to individualize the control of heart rate to reduce subjective symptoms and signs of HF.

European guidelines
21
 state that the AF heart rate at rest should be <110 beats/min. This is not supported by clear evidence, and it is important to adjust the heart rate appropriately while considering subjective symptoms and QOL in each patient.

AF, cardiac output is decreased and thrombus formation is enhanced due to the loss of effective atrial contraction. Additionally, irregular beats and tachycardia cause various clinical symptoms such as palpitation, chest discomfort, etc. Therefore, recovery of sinus rhythm itself has great benefit. However, clinical procedures aimed at sinus rhythm recovery, including pharmacological and non‐pharmacological approaches, have not only their benefits but also various risks related to these therapies. The adequacy of treatment must be judged in the balance between risk and benefit.

The mega‐trials that compared rhythm control (sinus rhythm maintenance) and rate control (heart rate control) failed to exhibit any difference in mortality.
229
, 
507
 In the J‐RHYTHM trial, the superiority of rhythm control was demonstrated, at least for paroxysmal AF, by using specific endpoints including quality of life (QOL).
509
 In those trials, rhythm therapy was mainly pharmacological. However, a recent trial that compared rhythm control and rate control by using catheter ablation as the main therapy for rhythm control, demonstrated recovery of cardiac function in cases of left ventricular dysfunction.
222
 Therefore, the value and therapeutic procedures of rhythm control must be reevaluated.

Because the same antiarrhythmic agents are commonly selected for recovery of sinus rhythm (defibrillation) and prevention of AF (sinus rhythm maintenance), the 2008 guideline
530
 unified them, but the 2013 guideline
2
 listed them separately. In this guideline, by considering various therapeutic options, including catheter ablation, especially for preventive therapy, these 2 concepts are described separately. In the selection list of antiarrhythmic agents, the usage record in Japan was weighted. In the selection of antiarrhythmic agents, safety must be the most important issue because pharmacological rhythm control should be understood as therapy for QOL improvement instead of decrease in mortality.

At the time of AF interruption (defibrillation), great attention must be paid to the possibility of systemic embolism by the pumping out intra‐atrial thrombus. It is important to confirm the absence of intra‐atrial thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography or to perform appropriate anticoagulation therapy, especially in patients in whom the possibility of more than 48‐h continuation of AF cannot be denied. Excepting emergencies, greatest attention must be paid to prevention of systemic embolism.

In the case of emergency in which hemodynamic stability cannot be expected, QRS‐triggered direct‐current defibrillation with ≥100 J electrical shock will be rapid and effective under appropriate anesthesia and respiratory control (Figure 17, Table 45).

Anticoagulation Therapy” for details). *2Hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease. *3Even without hemodynamic instability, rate control therapy might be combined in cases of symptomatic tachycardia (see “Chapter V. 4.

In addition to emergency treatment, direct‐current defibrillation should be applied when patients prefer it, when AF is refractory to pharmacological defibrillation, and when use of antiarrhythmic agents is considered more dangerous than direct‐current defibrillation. Especially in cases of AF complicated with organic heart disease such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents will be suppressed and the risk of proarrhythmia will be increased. In cases of heart failure, amiodarone might be used for the purpose of defibrillation, but it will take longer to evaluate its efficacy, so its use should be limited to patients in a stable condition. In case of symptomatic tachycardia, appropriate rate control is necessary and direct‐current defibrillation is recommended preferentially, versus pharmacological therapy, because of its immediate effect (Figure 17). However, because AF may recur even after successful defibrillation, preventive use of antiarrhythmic agents might be needed in some cases. When combined defibrillation with antiarrhythmic agent and direct‐current shock fail to achieve sinus rhythm recovery, a re‐trial of defibrillation after appropriate therapy for organic heart disease or catheter ablation should be considered.

Safety is the most important issue in the application of pharmacological defibrillation. Therefore, antiarrhythmic agents with negative inotropic effect or QT prolongation can be applied only in cases without organic heart diseases such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease. When pharmacological defibrillation is to be attempted in such cases, highly professional and careful decision making is necessary. In this edition of the guideline, use or limitation of Na+ channel blockers is highlighted and described in relation to the clinical type of AF.

Paroxysmal AF is defined as self‐interrupting AF within 7 days regardless of therapeutic intervention. Artificial defibrillation is recommended within 48 h from the onset of AF for the purpose of removing serious symptoms and/or reduction of risk for systemic embolism. It is known that the efficacy of Na+ channel blockers is higher for AF with shorter duration in cases without organic heart disease; therefore, the use of Na+ channel blocker is recommended for AF within 7 days of onset. However, appropriate antithrombotic strategy should be attempted for defibrillation because the risk for systemic embolism will increase with time. When an immediate effect is required, intravenous administration of an antiarrhythmic agent is more effective. However, there is also an administration method called “pill‐in‐the‐pocket” in which the patients take the drug orally once, depending on their own decision at the time of the AF attack.
531
 Standard antiarrhythmic agents for this purpose are pilsicainide 100 mg,
532

 It is understood that digitalis
537
, 
538
, 
539
 and/or sotalol
540
, 
541
 are ineffective for this purpose.

Na+ channel blocker leads to AF interruption by decreasing the activation frequency during AF through conduction delay and/or conduction block in the atrial muscle.
542
 Additional mechanisms, such as prolongation of post‐repolarization refractoriness,
543
, 
544
 increase the radius of the reentrant wave front,
545
, 
546
 and conduction block between the pulmonary veins and left atrium,
547
 are also considered to relate to AF interruption. These effects are stronger with slow kinetic drugs than the others, resulting in higher efficacy for AF interruption. These drugs also have a negative inotropic effect, but they can be used as first‐line medicine in AF without clinically important organic heart diseases. This point coincides with the American–European guidelines

Various strong Na+ channel blockers are approved for use in Japan. Pilsicainide is a pure Na+ channel blocker developed in Japan. Single oral use of pilsicainide 150 mg interrupted 45% of cases of AF lasting <7 days in the PSTAF trial.
532
 Cibenzoline blocks several K+ channels as well as the Na+ channel,
557
, 
558
 and a single oral dose of cibenzoline 200 mg interrupted 75–85% of AF lasting <48 h.
535
, 
536
 The efficacy of propafenone and flecainide have been widely reported, even in Western countries, with defibrillation rates (intravenous 2 mg/kg/20 min) of 72% and 90%, respectively.
559

There are various class IA antiarrhythmic agents with a K+ channel blocking effect and prolonging effect of the refractory period, such as disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, aprindine and pirmenol, all available in Japan. However, they were not listed as first‐line durgs because clinical use is currently limited. The efficacy of disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine for AF interruption has been verified, but they are not used widely in clinical practice because they have a higher chance of introducing torsade de pointes.

Persistent AF is defined as AF lasting >7 days, regardless of therapeutic intervention, which does not interrupt spontaneously but can be defibrillated by therapeutic intervention. When limited to pharmacological treatment, defibrillation has clinical meaning if targeting QOL improvement or preventing systemic embolism.
509
 However, in cases of persistent AF, it is common to have a long clinical course and organic heart disease as the clinical background, so the risks for systemic embolism and proarrhythmic effect may be high. When considering pharmacological therapy, specific attentions should be paid to the standard antithrombotic strategy and monitoring of side effects.

Continuation of AF promotes progression of atrial remodeling and AF tends to continue longer in the remodeled atria. AF can cause physiological change within tens of minutes and changes in ion channel density within several hours, so that the therapeutic effect may differ in the acute and subacute phases of AF. The level of remodeling can be generally evaluated by left atrial diameter, the duration of AF, fibrillation cycle length, etc.
560
 In a clinical trial of oral pilsicainide 150 mg/day, the defibrillation rate was lower in cases of AF lasting ≥2 weeks and in cases of left atrial diameter ≥45 mm.
561
 Flecainide and sotalol both failed to defibrillate AF in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days.
562

In this guideline, drug selection is described by setting the boundary as 7 days, at which time the effect of Na+ channel blockers becomes weakened. Experimentally, it has been reported that multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and bepridil may show gradual improvement of electrical remodeling (i.e., reverse remodeling).
563
, 
564
, 
565
 Although these drugs are clinically consistent, with interruption of long‐lasting AF after a few weeks,
543
, 
563
 the specific mechanisms have not been clarified.

Defibrillation by oral amiodarone is regarded as the standard treatment in Europe, especially in patients with organic heart disease.
21
 Amiodarone interrupted 23% of AF lasting ≥1 week in the PIAF study,
549
 and 27.1% of AF lasting ≥72 h (vs. placebo 0.8%) in the SAFE‐T study.
550
 Amiodarone is a limited antiarrhythmic agent that can be applied especially in cases of AF and organic heart disease. In this revision of the guideline, it is positioned as an active option for patients without symptomatic tachycardia. However, we should note that insurance coverage for use of amiodarone is limited to cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure in Japan.

There are some Japanese reports on bepridil. Fujiki et al. have reported that 69% of AF lasting ≥3 months could be interrupted.
566
 The J‐BAF study
551
 conducted in Japan demonstrated a 37.5% defibrillation rate by 100 mg/day and 69.0% defibrillation rate by 200 mg/day in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days, but a case of sudden death has been also reported with 200 mg/day of bepridil. Bepridil should be started from 100 mg/day orally, then possibly increased to 200 mg/day. These adjustments should be decided by a specialist under careful monitoring of QT interval and T‐wave morphology.
567

Recommendation class and level of evidence for pharmacological prevention of AF recurrence are summarized in Table 47.

 AF prevention is not necessary in cases of first‐diagnosed AF without organic heart disease, because the recurrence rate is limited in such cases. AF prevention is indicated in cases of symptomatic recurrent AF that repeats at regular intervals, but AF prevention may also be indicated in patients at a risk of systemic embolism even if they are less symptomatic. In recent years, the efficacy of catheter ablation has dramatically improved,
556
 so it should be included as a considered therapeutic option, especially in cases of symptomatic AF requiring long‐term pharmacological therapy (see “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy for Arrhythmia” (edited 2018) for details of indications for catheter ablation

).

Recommendation and Levels of Evidence for Pharmacological Prevention of AF Recurrence

pilsicainide, cibenzoline, propafenone, flecainide. Use of these drugs should be avoided in cases of Brugada syndrome or organic heart disease that might be affected by negative‐inotropic effect, or with a history of atrial flutter.

AF, atrial fibrillation; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Even when an antiarrhythmic drug with a highly recommended order is selected, it is necessary to pay close attention to the appearance of negative inotropic effects and proarrhythmic effects during long‐term administration, and to the emergence of extracardiac side effects specific to amiodarone.

Because antiarrhythmic agents affect the ionic currents in the myocardium, they can cause various secondary pathologies such as negative inotropic effects and the development of proarrhythmic effects through QT prolongation due to delayed repolarization. This revision of the guideline follows the concept in the 2013 revised edition
2
 and describes the drugs indicated for cases with and without organic heart disease (hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease). In addition, the conditions that are related to AF such as hypertensproion, dyslipidemia are described as complications (Figure 18).

Flowchart for prevention of AF. *1Anticoagulation therapy might be continued depending on individual risks for embolism and efficacy of AF preventive therapy (see “Chapter V. 3 Anticoagulation Therapy” for details). *2Rate control therapy might be continued in cases of possible AF recurrence and considerable symptoms during AF (see “Chapter V. 4 Rate Control Therapy” for details). *3See the “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy”, 2018 edition 3 for details. *4Hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease. *5Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea syndrome, etc. (see “Chapter V. 2.5 Management of Risk Factors and Comorbidity” for details). *6Appropriate therapeutic intervention for basic and/or complicated diseases (see “Chapter V. 6 Upstream Therapy” for details). *7Insurance coverage for amiodarone is approved in Japan only for patients with AF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Insurance coverage for sotalol is not approved for patients with AF, although the efficacy of sotalol on AF complicated with ischemic heart disease. *8bepridil is reported to be effective for AF with ventricular dysfunction; however there are reports warning of exaggeration of proarrhythmia. AF, atrial fibrillation.

As the background of AF without organic heart disease, systemic pathological conditions such as aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, as well as activity of the autonomic nervous system are involved. AF can be divided into nighttime type (parasympathetic nerve activation type), daytime type (sympathetic nerve activation type), and all‐day type in relation to autonomic nervous system activity. There are studies that evaluated the effects of drugs with M2 receptor blocking action or β‐blocking action in each type of AF, but a universal effect can be expected with strong Na+ channel blockers (Figure 18). There is no evidence for any specific drug (e.g., angiotensin‐receptor blockers), which were once anticipated as upstream therapy, exhibiting an anti‐remodeling effect for AF, but strict control of hypertension or dyslipidemia has been effective in suppressing AF as a control measure for these complicating diseases.
234
, 
561
 Therefore, control of complicating diseases is important for controlling AF (Figure 18).

Regarding the long‐term preventive effect of pilsicainide for AF recurrence, it was reported as effective in 53.8% during 12‐month observation for daytime‐type AF.
553
 However, the effect of a Na+ channel blocker is expected to diminish over time, because the target of the blocker (i.e., expression of the Na+ channel itself) will be decreased during continuation of AF. Cibenzoline is more effective than pilsicainide for prevention of AF lasting ≥48 h because it has effects on several K+ channels.
571
 Propafenone, a Na+ channel blocker with a β‐blocking effect, is reported to be more effective than the others for daytime‐type AF.
572
 These findings will help with choosing specific drugs for individual patients.

The effects of flecainide and propafenone have been demonstrated in a Western report.
534
 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Japan also demonstrated that the 1‐month preventive efficacy of flecainide for paroxysmal AF was 39.4% (vs. placebo 3.1%).
573

Regarding the effect of bepridil for AF prevention, Nakazato et al. have reported 18‐month sinus rhythm maintenance in 81% of 86 cases in whom defibrillation succeeded.
548
 Even in comparison with amiodarone, bepridil exhibited a higher AF prevention rate (75%) in comparison with amiodarone (50%) during 14.7 months’ observation.
574
 In contrast, Shiga et al. observed that 23.5% of cases transitioned to permanent AF from paroxysmal AF even under continuation of bepridil therapy, and concluded that its long‐term effect might be limited.
575
 There are some recent reports of the efficacy of pilsicainide or bepridil for cases of AF recurrence after successful catheter ablation. Bepridil has been reported as more effective for cases of remodeled enlarged left atrium. In cases of AF without organic heart disease, bepridil is reported to be effective for Na+ channel blocker refractory AF.
568

It is controversial when pharmacological therapy should be stopped if it is effective for AF prevention. In a study comparing short‐tem (4 weeks) and long‐term (6 months) treatment,
576
 the recurrence rate was higher with short‐term treatment but the difference was only 20%. Considering the cost and risk of long‐term treatment, short‐term treatment may have its own benefit. An observational study that evaluated long‐term treatment (mean 3.4 years) documented cases of death related to pharmacological treatment,
577
 so careless long‐term administration should be avoided. The actual decision for continuation or cessation, as well as the dosing of antiarrhythmic agents, should be performed by considering the individual conditions of AF as well as liver–kidney function (Table 48).

Standard Doses of Representative Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Administration should start with the smaller dose, then can be increased to a higher dose under careful monitoring of side and/or proarrhythmic effects.

Organic heart disease, such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, may influence hemodynamics during AF, resulting in more serious symptoms. Therefore, AF prevention is more important in these cases, but the effects of antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation will be limited because of the progression in atrial remodeling. Negative inotropic action and/or QT prolongation may appear more strongly in these cases. Therefore, upstream therapy (i.e., not only monotherapy but also appropriate therapeutic strategy) for the basic disease becomes important (Figure 18).

The use of renin–angiotensin system blockers (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin‐receptor blocker) was related to a decrease of AF in a the subanalyses of several RCTs,
569
, 
570
, 
578
, 
579
 but the effect of a single intervention, so‐called “upstream therapy”, has been denied.
235
, 
552
, 
580
 These drugs should be used as basic appropriate therapy for heart failure with β‐blockers
581
 as “upstream therapy” in the broad sense.

Because of the presence of organic heart disease, the target of antiarrhythmic agents will change due to changes in the expression of ion channels. Generally, organic heart disease causes atrial fibrosis, which promotes the formation of random reentry within the atria.
555
 Under such conditions, it will be difficult to suppress the many reentries by simple conduction block caused by a Na+ channel blocker. On the other hand, prolongation of the action potential duration caused by a K+ channel blocker can make it difficult to form functional reentry in any part of the atria. Therefore, a K+ channel blocker will be more effective than a Na+ channel blocker in heart failure.
582
 In Japan, amiodarone, sotalol, bepridil and class IA antiarrhythmic agents can be used as K+ channel blockers, but a Na+ channel blocker cannot be used in heart failure, because of the negative inotropic effect.

Japanese insurance coverage for persistent AF is limited for amiodarone in heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or for bepridil. Because there are some reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes during bepridil therapy for AF with organic heart disease,
583
 bepridil is not described as first‐line therapy, but amiodarone and sotalol are listed with comments about limited insurance coverage (Figure 18). Regarding the use of amiodarone for AF with heart failure, the CHF‐STAT study demonstrated the effect for defibrillation and sinus rhythm maintenance.
584
 In that study, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 31% of 51 cases (vs. placebo 8%) and the patients with sinus rhythm exhibited better prognosis than those with AF. However, there may have been a selection bias because the patients in whom defibrillation was successful were assigned to the sinus rhythm group.

In the AF‐CHF study,
508
 an intention‐to‐treat comparison was performed between sinus rhythm and rate control groups. In this study, the sinus rhythm group, which was mainly treated with amiodarone, demonstrated 46–83% of sinus rhythm (vs. 30–41% rate control group) but no difference was observed in prognosis. The study denied the option of maintaining sinus rhythm recovery in drug‐refractory cases, but rhythm control with amiodarone might be an option initially, because the prognosis itself is better with sinus rhythm than with AF.

In the CASTLE‐AF study,
229
 rhythm control and rate control were compared using catheter ablation as the tool for rhythm control in cases of ventricular dysfunction. As a result, the rhythm control group exhibited lower mortality and higher recovery of ventricular dysfunction. Because ablation is more difficult in cases of AF with organic heart disease, the result should be reconfirmed in standardized interventional trials. However, the roles of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for AF prevention must be further investigated together.

Atrial remodeling (ATR) creates the arrhythmogenic substrate for AF and plays a critical role in the pathophysiology. ATR is characterized by changes in the electrical and structural properties of atrial tissues and cells. These changes are caused by AF‐promoting pathological mediators, including neurohumoral factors (catecholamines, angiotensin II, etc.), growth factors (transforming growth factor‐β, etc.), stretch, inflammation, and oxidative stress. “Upstream therapy” is the pharmacological intervention targeting these upstream pathological mediators that promote AF. Although upstream therapy has been demonstrated to prevent ATR and AF in experimental studies, its efficacy has not been validated in clinical studies. There is thus a gap between the results of experimental and clinical research. Evidence of upstream therapy against AF in comorbid diseases associated with AF is shown in Table 49.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Upstream Therapy for AF Prevention in Underlying Comorbid Diseases

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated by AF and AF‐associated comorbid diseases, which increases the production of angiotensin II (AT‐II), a pathological mediator for AF. Binding of AT‐II to the receptor in atrial cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts activates profibrotic signaling and promotes fibrotic remodeling. Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin‐receptor blockers (ARBs) suppresses ATR and AF in animal models of AF.

In subanalyses and meta‐analyses of clinical studies, treatment with ACEIs or ARBs has demonstrated efficacy for primary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure, hypertension, and left ventricular hypertrophy.

 However, that efficacy has not been validated by a large‐scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Regarding efficacy for secondary prevention of AF, treatment with ACEIs or ARBs neither prevented AF recurrence
235
, 
580
 nor improved mortality
596
 in paroxysmal and persistent AF patients who had sinus rhythm restored after pharmacological or electrical cardioversion. In the J‐RHYTHM II trial (the Japanese rhythm management trial II for AF), an open‐label randomized study, treatment with an ARB (candesartan) lowered blood pressure in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF, and also decreased the frequency and symptoms of AF. However, these effects were comparable to the effects of treatment with a Ca2+ channel blocker (CCB, amlodipine); the ARB did not show additional antiarrhythmic effect in AF patients.
234
 In a similar RCT in Asia, treatment with an ARB (telmisartan) did not improve efficacy for secondary prevention of AF in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF when compared with a CCB (nifedipine); however, the percentage of patients who developed AF with a transition from the paroxysmal to persistent form significantly decreased with telmisartan compared with nifedipine, suggesting that ARBs have potential to prevent AF maintenance associated with ATR.
597

In an experimental study, treatment with a mineralocorticoid‐receptor antagonist (MRA) suppressed atrial fibrosis in an animal model of heart failure.
598
 In a subanalysis of the EMPHASIS‐HF trial, patients treated with a MRA showed lower incidence of new‐onset AF than those treated with placebo.
599
 MRAs show potential to prevent AF,

, 
601
 but clinical efficacy has not been validated by a large‐scale RCT.

Statins exhibit actions beyond lipid lowering in the prevention of various cardiovascular diseases, including AF, known as “pleiotropic effects”. Statins are thought to prevent AF and stroke through modulation of the inflammatory response, improvement of endothelial function, and prevention of blood clot formation. Statin treatment has suppressed AF and ATR progression in experimental studies.

, 
603
 However, the preventive effect of statins has not been validated in patients with AF‐associated diseases such as heart failure and hypertension.

 In open‐heart surgery, periprocedural statin treatment has been demonstrated to prevent postoperative AF.

, 
607
, 
608
 However, in a recent RCT, statin treatment failed to show a protective effect against postoperative AF and increased the risk of acute renal injury compared with placebo.
609

Cardiac autonomic nerves are nested in the epicardial adipose tissues of the heart, forming an intrinsic network (i.e., ganglionated plexus, GP). Sympathetic and parasympathetic activities alter the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and thus the cellular electrophysiological properties, facilitating AF.
610
 In a histological analysis, autonomic nerve hyperplasia within the GP was observed in canine models of heart failure with AF substrate.
611
 Treatment with β‐blockers has prevented AF recurrence in patients who had sinus rhythm restored after pharmacological or electrical cardioversion.
581
, 
612
 In a meta‐analysis, β‐blocker treatment was effective for primary prevention of AF in heart failure patients with reduced cardiac function.
521
, 
588

Apart from AF, ACEI/ARB, MRA, and β‐blocker have become a practical standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. ACEI/ARB are also commonly used to treat hypertension. These drugs target upstream mediators of AF but their effect on AF prevention has not been validated in clinical practice. Although evidence for the clinical benefit of upstream therapy against AF is still limited, it can be anticipated when these drugs are used as a standard treatment for the comorbid diseases associated with AF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) progresses from paroxysmal to persistent, leading to dilatation of the left atrium (LA). Catheter ablation (CA) is less effective in the advanced stage, so should be considered before progression of AF.

CA for symptomatic drug‐refractory paroxysmal AF (≥1 class I or III drugs) is recommended in the 2018 JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (Class I; Level of Evidence A, Figure 19, 
4
, Table 50, 
4
). Early CA for drug‐refractory AF is recommended because it is high likely to progress to persistent AF, resulting in LA dilatation. There are 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF.
613
, 
614
, 
615
 Furthermore, a meta‐analysis including these RCTs has been reporrted.
616
 All of these studies showed a significant reduction of AF burden in the CA group, and a low incidence of procedure‐related complications. These results suggest that it is reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal AF.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Catheter Ablation of Symptomatic Drug‐Refractory Paroxysmal AF

Refractory to at least one of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs.

(Adapted from JCS and JHRS 2021.3)

Regarding CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, prospective studies showed higher rates of maintenance of sinus rhythm in the CA group compared with the amiodarone group.
617
, 
618
 It is therefore also reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, given that antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective.
4
 There is insufficient evidence to support CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic longstanding AF. Because longstanding persistent AF is accompanied by significant electrical and structural remodeling of the atria, it is difficult to restore and maintain sinus rhythm despite repeated ablation procedures. Factors such as the degree of LA dilatation, patient’s age, symptoms, and patient preference should be taken into account for the indication of CA.
4

Five RCTs comparing the efficacy of CA to medical therapy (rate control) in patients with low cardiac function have been reported to date,
619
, 
620
, 
621
, 
622
, 
623
 and a meta‐analysis including 4 of those studies has been conducted.
624
 According to the analysis, 224 patients, of whom 82.5% had persistent AF, were randomized to CA group or rate control group. AF ablation was associated with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, mean difference 8.5%) compared with rate control. CA was superior in improving quality of life (QOL) and increasing peak oxygen consumption compared with rate control. Major adverse event rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

The AATAC trial was a RCT comparing efficacy of CA for sinus rhythm maintenance to amiodarone over a 2‐year follow‐up. Sinus rhythm maintenance rate was significantly higher in CA group compared with the amiodarone group (70% vs. 34%). CA was superior in improving QOL and reducing unplanned hospitalizations and mortality compared with amiodarone.
625

The CASTLE‐AF trial was a RCT designed to investigate whether CA is associated with better prognosis than medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) in patients with heart failure (HF) and AF. After a 3‐year follow‐up, CA for AF in patients with HF was superior to medical therapy in sinus rhythm maintenance, improving cardiac function and prognosis.
222
 Based on these results, the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018) suggested that CA may improve the prognosis of AF patients with HF, and recommended the same indication (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) in patients with and without HF (reduced left ventricular function).
4

Pacemaker (PM) implantation has been recommended as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic patients with bradycardia–tachycardia syndrome (BTS). However, some patients who have sinus pause only after termination of AF could be treated by CA without PM.
626
, 
627
 The indication should be discussed in detail because of insufficient evidence and lack of RCTs (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).
4

Many AF patients are elderly, and the efficacy and safety of CA for older AF patients have been reported.
628
, 
629
 Therefore it is reasonable that elderly patients (generally ≥75 years old) with preserved ADL (activities of daily living) have the same therapeutic indication as younger patients. However, CA for elderly patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF has a lower recommendation than that for young patients because of insufficient evidence. So far, CA for persistent or longstanding persistent AF has limitations, and patients often require repeat procedure. Furthermore, it is often better to choose medical therapy (rate control) in asymptomatic patients with persistent AF. Therefore it is important to make the decision after informing patients about the risks and benefits of CA.

CA for AF has been limited to symptomatic cases. However, recently it was reported that CA can improve prognosis regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms,
630
 and the prognosis of asymptomatic AF patients was worse than that of symptomatic AF patients.
631
 CA is recommended because it can improve prognosis, even if patients are asymptomatic at the time of AF diagnosis, without deterioration of QOL. Based on this consideration, CA for asymptomatic AF patients was newly introduced in the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018).
74

To date, 4 studies regarding the efficacy and safety of CA for asymptomatic AF have been reported.
632
, 
633
, 
634
, 
635
 Forleo et al reported that the efficacy of CA in asymptomatic AF patients was the same as that in symptomatic patients.
632
 However, Wu et al demonstrated that symptoms got worse in many of the asymptomatic AF patients after CA because of the development of atrial tachycardia.
633
 Meanwhile, improvement in exercise tolerance, B‐type natriuretic peptide level, and QOL after CA have been reported, even when patients were asymptomatic.
634
, 
635
 Currently, the indication of CA for asymptomatic AF patients should be discussed in detail because of the lack of RCT evidence. CA for asymptomatic longstanding persistent AF is not recommended because it is too late in the clinical course (repeated recurrence of asymptomatic paroxysmal AF, asymptomatic persistent AF: Class IIb, Level of Evidence C).
4

AV node ablation is recommended for AF patients with medically uncontrollable heart rate, who have severe symptoms of tachycardia or severely reduced heart function or decline of QOL, in cases of unsuccessful or contraindication of CA.
4
 The indication should be discussed for each case, because a permanent pacemaker is needed.

PM implantation is recommended in AF patients with bradycardia‐related symptoms such as faintness and shortness of breath (Class I).
636

### Epidemiology, Pathophysiology and Electrophysiological Mechanism of Atrial Fibrillation

AF is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice and its prevalence increases with age. AF is also associated with the risk of developing some adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death. Therefore, the burden imposed on the medical system by AF is expected to increase with the increase in the population aged ≥65 years. Therefore, epidemiological information such as the prevalence of AF and related factors is important.

The prevalence of AF depends not only on age, but also on conditions such as sex, race, hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and socioeconomic factors.
141
, 
142
, 
143
, 
144
, 
145
 The prevalence of AF is increasing year by year. A community‐based Framingham Heart Study reported that the prevalence of age‐adjusted AF has quadrupled (i.e., in men from 20.4 to 96.2 per 1,000 person‐years and in women from 13.7 to 49.4 per 1,000 person‐years)
146
 However, because the increased prevalence of AF may be due to an increased rate of risk factors, including older age, as well as improved detection methods for asymptomatic AF, interpretation of data requires caution.
146
 In Japan, an epidemiological study was conducted by the Japanese Circulation Society,
147
 and the results of periodical health checkups in 2003 (630,138 people aged ≥40 years who underwent health checkups) showed that the prevalence of AF increased with age in both men and women. The percentage increased to 3.44% for men and 1.12% for women in their 70 s; 4.43% for men and 2.19% for women over 80 years old. When this result is applied to the Japanese population and calculated, it is estimated that 716,000 people in Japan had AF as of 2005.
147
 When calculated using future population projections, it is predicted that by 2050 there will be approximately 1.03 million AF patients, accounting for approximately 1.1% of the total population.

Addressing modifiable clinical risk factors may reduce the long‐term risk of developing AF or delay the onset of disease. Therefore, identification, prevention, and treatment of such conditions are important to prevent the development of AF. However, it should be noted that it is unclear how the treatment and removal of a single modifiable risk factor reduces the risk of AF (Table 17).

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Assessing Risk of AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Hypertension is the most widely accepted risk factor for AF.
141
, 
142
, 
143
, 
144
, 
145
 It is reported that 56.5% of AF cases had ≥1 risk factors, of which hypertension was the most important factor.
142
, 
148
 It has also been reported that differences in long‐term patterns, such as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure and a longer history of antihypertensive treatment, are associated with an increased risk of developing AF.
149
 An urban cohort study of cerebral and cardiovascular disease among Japanese reported that the hazard ratio of systolic blood pressure in AF was further increased by being overweight.
150

An increase in fasting glucose of 18 mg/dL increased the risk of developing AF by 33% in a test population with impaired glucose tolerance.
151
 However, no clear association between AF and diabetes has been suggested.
146
, 
151
, 
152
 In addition, intensive glycemic control has not been shown to improve the new incidence of AF.
153

Reports have been increasing in recent years suggesting a link between obesity and AF. The number of obese patients tend to increase,
146
 and an increase in body mass index (BMI) is associated with AF.
152
 Importantly, among the modifiable risk factors, obesity is the most prominent risk factor affecting the lifetime risk of AF.
146
, 
152
, 
154
 In addition, a study that examined the relationship between changes in BMI over 10 years and AF showed that decreased BMI decreased AF risk and increased BMI increased AF risk in both men and women.
155

An increasing number of reports suggest a relationship between sleep‐disordered breathing and AF risk. Meta‐analysis results suggest that sleep‐disordered breathing may increase the risk of AF, and the higher the severity, the higher the risk of AF.
156
, 
157

A limited number of studies have examined the relationship between uric acid and AF. In a cross‐sectional study of 325,771 patients undergoing regular physical examinations at a single health center in Japan, serum uric acid levels were independent of other cardiovascular risk factors for AF in both men and women. It was significantly associated with prevalence.
158
 Besides, the result of a retrospective study of 49,292 Japanese diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and hyperuricemia or gout by a regular medical examination in a single hospital from January 2004 to June 2010 but without receiving uric acid‐lowering drugs, showed that hyperuricemia was an independent risk factor for AF.
159

Smoking is a known risk factor for AF.
142
, 
152
, 
160
 It has also been reported that smokers with AF are at increased risk of hospitalization and death.
145
 A nearly 2‐year prospective study investigating the association between AF and smoking and total tobacco consumption in hospitalized patients in a single hospital in Japan found that current smokers and smokers with a Brinkman index ≥800, were independently associated with new onset of AF. However, in current smokers, the Brinkman index does not differ in hazard ratio, suggesting the importance of stopping smoking to prevent AF.
161

Meta‐analysis results indicate that AF risk increases with increasing alcohol consumption.
162
, 
163
 It has been reported that the risk of developing AF increases by 5% and the left atrium expands by 0.16 mm for every 10 g of daily alcohol intake (equivalent to a full glass).
164

It has been reported that the lifetime risk of AF is significantly increased even if only 1 clinical risk factor is present.
152
 The CHARGE‐AF score for AF risk assessment has been developed from research focusing on multiple cohorts, including age, race, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, current smoking, treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and diabetes features.
144
 This score has subsequently been shown to be useful in predicting AF risk in multiple cohorts.
165
 In Japan, a 10‐year risk score for AF has been created using traditional risk factors that can be easily obtained by ordinary outpatient clinics, but the results of external verification of risk scores using other cohorts are awaited.
148

The lifetime risk of AF varies significantly with an increased genetic predisposition in addition to clinical risk factors.
160
, 
166
, 
167
 A community‐based Framingham study has reported the long‐term potential for AF considering the CHARGE‐AF score consisting of clinical risk factors, and the genetic predisposition estimated by a genetic risk score generated from approximately 1,000 AF‐related single nucleotide polymorphisms.
160
 It was suggested that the lifetime risk of AF in individuals with a high genetic risk score was sufficiently high even with a low CHARGE‐AF score. Atrial fibrillation was also presumed to occur earlier in individuals with high CHARGE‐AF scores than in individuals with low CHARGE‐AF scores, regardless of genetic risk score.
160

The generation of both abnormal excitation (automaticity/auto‐excitation) as a trigger for premature beats and formation of a substrate constituting reentry circuit of AF in the atrium and the pulmonary vein, play a pivotal role for onset and maintenance of AF. Risk factors and AF itself form the substrate. Electrical remodeling alters the ion channels expression, causing conduction disturbance and shortened refractory periods, whereas structural remodeling induced by atrial fibrosis impairs the conduction disturbance. Besides, atrial remodeling (ATR) enhances coagulation to form thrombus. As shown in Figure 8, hypertension, obesity, diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea are identified as risk factors for atrial remodeling.
168

Risk factors contributing to both atrial remodeling and formation of thrombus. DAD, delayed afterdepolarization; EAD, early afterdepolarization; ERP, effective refractory period; RAS, renin–angiotensin system; SAS, sleep apnea syndrome.

Either external stress, induced by structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory disease, or AF itself cause structural remodeling of the atrium. Pathophysiological changes responsible for ATR are characterized by activation of fibroblasts, increased connective tissue, fibrosis etc.
169
, 
170
, 
171
 In addition, atrial fat infiltration, inflammatory cell infiltration, hypertrophy, and necrosis, as well as deposition of amyloid are also observed. The structural remodeling disturbs electrical coupling among cardiac muscle fibers and causes heterogeneity of local electrical conductions, which facilitates formation of a reentry circuit.
172

ATR reduces the contractility of atrial muscles in association with enlargement of the atrium, which facilitates blood congestion in the atrium, thus accelerating thrombus formation. Activation of both the renin–angiotensin system
173
, 
174
, 
175
, 
176
 and the autonomic nervous system
177
, 
178
, 
179
 contribute to vascular remodeling, which induces atrial muscle ischemia, leading to ATR. On the other hand, ATR activates the expression of thrombus formation factors on the atrial endothelium together with activation of platelets and inflammatory cells, which contribute to thrombus formation.
180
, 
181
 These intra‐atrial activations and circulating coagulation factors could explain the onset of stroke following a short episode of AF.

Both the electrical remodeling responsible for the arrhythmogenic substrate and the abnormal automaticity responsible for the trigger underly the electrophysiological mechanism of AF.

The trigger for reentry arrythmia is defined as early ectopic excitation derived from a source different from the sinus node. Approximately 90% of ectopic excitation originates from the myocardial sleeve localized in the pulmonary vein. Some ectopic excitation derives from ectopic triggers in the area of either the superior vena cava or atrium as well. Underlying mechanisms on trigger are as described.

Impaired regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration induces Ca2+ leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the diastolic phase of cardiac myocytes, which plays a pivotal role in the generation of the trigger responsible for AF. In AF, the Ca2+ handling proteins have been hyperphosphorylated, which elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and induces spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR. This increases the inward currents on the cell membrane via activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger causes the delayed afterdepolarization
182
, 
183
, 
184
, 
185
, 
186
 associated with triggered activity that facilitate ectopic excitation and leads to AF.
187
 Furthermore, activation of sympathetic nervous system augments the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, facilitating abnormal automaticity and triggered activity.
188

Hassaguerre et al
189
 demonstrated that automaticity excitation induced by triggered activity in the pulmonary vein becomes the trigger for AF, and the boundary between the pulmonary vein and atrial muscles forms the reentry circuit, which results in sustained AF.
190
, 
191
 This hierarchy of trigger and substrate in AF is observed in patients with paroxysmal AF,
192
, 
193
 although it remains unclear whether this hierarchy occurs in patients with sustained AF.
194

Moe and Abildskov
179
 demonstrated that AF could be sustained via multiple independent wavelets, which are conducted in a disorderly way through the muscular layer of the atrium. Many experimental and clinical observations support the multiple wavelet hypothesis.
195
 However, localized excitation (i.e., ectopic excitation, rotor and other stable reentry circuits) conducting to atrial fibrillation resembels to the spiral wave derived from multiple wavelet, so it is impossible to distinguish it from sustained AF caused by multiple wavelets.

The transition from paroxysmal AF to sustained AF is defined by the concept of “AF begets AF”.
196
 This concept encompasses the shortening of both the atrial refractory period and cycle length.
196
, 
197
 Although the number of electrical reentry circuits determines the sustainment of AF, the shorter the wave length of the reentry circuit becomes, the larger the number of reentry circuits, contributing to sustainability of AF (wave length hypothesis).
198
 The underlying mechanism is as follows. First, repeated excitation physiologically shortens the effective refectory period via the inducing of intracellular Ca2+ overloading, which is followed by progressive pathological shortening of the atrial refractory period through both downregulation of Ca2+ channel current and upregulation of inward‐rectifier K+ channel currents.
199
, 
200
 As well, the decreases in the expression of Na+ channel current and I
to currents results in both shortening of the refractory period and a reduction in conduction velocity. On the other hand, activation of parasympathetic nerve tone shortens the atrial action potential duration via activation of the acetylcholine‐sensitive K+ channel, which facilitates the formation of a reentry circuit in the atrium.
198

### Epidemiology of Atrial Fibrillation

AF is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice and its prevalence increases with age. AF is also associated with the risk of developing some adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death. Therefore, the burden imposed on the medical system by AF is expected to increase with the increase in the population aged ≥65 years. Therefore, epidemiological information such as the prevalence of AF and related factors is important.

The prevalence of AF depends not only on age, but also on conditions such as sex, race, hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and socioeconomic factors.
141
, 
142
, 
143
, 
144
, 
145
 The prevalence of AF is increasing year by year. A community‐based Framingham Heart Study reported that the prevalence of age‐adjusted AF has quadrupled (i.e., in men from 20.4 to 96.2 per 1,000 person‐years and in women from 13.7 to 49.4 per 1,000 person‐years)
146
 However, because the increased prevalence of AF may be due to an increased rate of risk factors, including older age, as well as improved detection methods for asymptomatic AF, interpretation of data requires caution.
146
 In Japan, an epidemiological study was conducted by the Japanese Circulation Society,
147
 and the results of periodical health checkups in 2003 (630,138 people aged ≥40 years who underwent health checkups) showed that the prevalence of AF increased with age in both men and women. The percentage increased to 3.44% for men and 1.12% for women in their 70 s; 4.43% for men and 2.19% for women over 80 years old. When this result is applied to the Japanese population and calculated, it is estimated that 716,000 people in Japan had AF as of 2005.
147
 When calculated using future population projections, it is predicted that by 2050 there will be approximately 1.03 million AF patients, accounting for approximately 1.1% of the total population.

Addressing modifiable clinical risk factors may reduce the long‐term risk of developing AF or delay the onset of disease. Therefore, identification, prevention, and treatment of such conditions are important to prevent the development of AF. However, it should be noted that it is unclear how the treatment and removal of a single modifiable risk factor reduces the risk of AF (Table 17).

### Structural Remodeling of Atrial Muscles

Either external stress, induced by structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory disease, or AF itself cause structural remodeling of the atrium. Pathophysiological changes responsible for ATR are characterized by activation of fibroblasts, increased connective tissue, fibrosis etc.

### Electrophysiological Mechanism of Atrial Fibrillation

Both the electrical remodeling responsible for the arrhythmogenic substrate and the abnormal automaticity responsible for the trigger underly the electrophysiological mechanism of AF.

The trigger for reentry arrythmia is defined as early ectopic excitation derived from a source different from the sinus node. Approximately 90% of ectopic excitation originates from the myocardial sleeve localized in the pulmonary vein. Some ectopic excitation derives from ectopic triggers in the area of either the superior vena cava or atrium as well. Underlying mechanisms on trigger are as described.

Impaired regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration induces Ca2+ leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the diastolic phase of cardiac myocytes, which plays a pivotal role in the generation of the trigger responsible for AF. In AF, the Ca2+ handling proteins have been hyperphosphorylated, which elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and induces spontaneous Ca2+ release from the SR. This increases the inward currents on the cell membrane via activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger causes the delayed afterdepolarization

 associated with triggered activity that facilitate ectopic excitation and leads to AF.
187
 Furthermore, activation of sympathetic nervous system augments the elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, facilitating abnormal automaticity and triggered activity.
188

Hassaguerre et al
189
 demonstrated that automaticity excitation induced by triggered activity in the pulmonary vein becomes the trigger for AF, and the boundary between the pulmonary vein and atrial muscles forms the reentry circuit, which results in sustained AF.

, 
191
 This hierarchy of trigger and substrate in AF is observed in patients with paroxysmal AF,
192
, 
193
 although it remains unclear whether this hierarchy occurs in patients with sustained AF.
194

Moe and Abildskov
179
 demonstrated that AF could be sustained via multiple independent wavelets, which are conducted in a disorderly way through the muscular layer of the atrium. Many experimental and clinical observations support the multiple wavelet hypothesis.
195
 However, localized excitation (i.e., ectopic excitation, rotor and other stable reentry circuits) conducting to atrial fibrillation resembels to the spiral wave derived from multiple wavelet, so it is impossible to distinguish it from sustained AF caused by multiple wavelets.

The transition from paroxysmal AF to sustained AF is defined by the concept of “AF begets AF”.
196
 This concept encompasses the shortening of both the atrial refractory period and cycle length.
196
, 
197
 Although the number of electrical reentry circuits determines the sustainment of AF, the shorter the wave length of the reentry circuit becomes, the larger the number of reentry circuits, contributing to sustainability of AF (wave length hypothesis).
198
 The underlying mechanism is as follows. First, repeated excitation physiologically shortens the effective refectory period via the inducing of intracellular Ca2+ overloading, which is followed by progressive pathological shortening of the atrial refractory period through both downregulation of Ca2+ channel current and upregulation of inward‐rectifier K+ channel currents.
199
, 
200
 As well, the decreases in the expression of Na+ channel current and I
to currents results in both shortening of the refractory period and a reduction in conduction velocity. On the other hand, activation of parasympathetic nerve tone shortens the atrial action potential duration via activation of the acetylcholine‐sensitive K+ channel, which facilitates the formation of a reentry circuit in the atrium.

### Basic Strategy for Diagnosis and Management

In general, AF starts as the paroxysmal form. The duration and frequency of the episodes increase with time, until AF becomes persistent and permanent. AF can be classified as 1 of 5 forms as described in Figure 9, 
202
, 
203
 and Table 18.

AF that has not been diagnosed before. According to the clinical course, first‐diagnosed AF is classified as paroxysmal, persistent, long‐standing persistent or permanent. If first‐diagnosed AF terminates spontaneously, AF will not recur for several years in ≈50% of patients. In CARAF,
204
 899 first‐diagnosed AF patients were observed during a mean period of 4.1 years. Within 1 year, AF recurred in ≈50% of the patients. During the follow‐up period, 6–7% of the patients developed cerebral infarction.
204

Paroxysmal AF is AF that is self‐terminating, in most cases, within 48 h. Some AF paroxysms may continue for up to 7 days. In a Japanese study, during a mean follow‐up period of 14.1 years, paroxysmal AF eventually transited to the permanent form under conventional antiarrhythmic therapy (5.5% of patients per year).
205

AF that lasts longer than 7 days. The actuarial cumulative percentages of patients who maintained sinus rhythm after serial cardioversion treatment was reported to be 42% and 27% after 1 and 4 years, respectively.
206

Continuous AF lasting for ≥1 year, when it is decided to adopt a rhythm control strategy by cardioversion and/or catheter ablation.

AF that is accepted by the patient (and physician).

The recommendation for the evaluation method of AF based on symptoms is given in Table 19. The modified European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) divides the original class 2 into mild (2a) or moderate (2b) effect
207
 (Table 20). Class 2b identifies patients with a health utility benefit of rhythm control; this modification may provide a threshold for potential treatment decisions. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation (CCS‐SAF) scale is also available.

In a Japanese single‐center study,
206
 first‐diagnosed AF patients without structural heart disease (n=289) were reviewed with regard to 2 symptom classifications (CCS‐SAF and EHRA). In both classifications, asymptomatic patients comprised ≈40% of the patients. The Fushimi AF registry
207
 investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF (n=1,837) or persistent/permanent (sustained AF; n=1,912) subgroups. Multivariable analysis indicated that age (≥75 years), history of stroke/systemic embolism, male sex, and chronic kidney disease were independent determinants of asymptomatic status in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas age was nonsignificant in the sustained AF group. During the follow‐up period, all‐cause death was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group compared with symptomatic patients in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas it was comparable in the sustained AF group.
210

The term “cryptogenic stroke” refers to a stroke for which there is no specific attributable cause after a comprehensive evaluation.
211
 There is persuasive evidence that most cryptogenic strokes are thromboembolic. The thrombus is thought to originate from any of several well‐established potential embolic sources, including minor‐risk or covert cardiac sources, veins via paradoxical embolism, and non‐occlusive atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch or the cervical, or cerebral arteries. Accordingly, the term “embolic strokes of undetermined source” (ESUS) was proposed for a therapeutically relevant entity, which is defined as a non‐lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic source.
212
 The diagnostic criteria for ESUS are described in Table 21. Undiagnosed AF is considered to be one of the causes of ESUS. NAVIGATE ESUS tested the hypothesis that anticoagulant treatment with rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may result in a lower risk of recurrent stroke than aspirin.
213
 A total of 7,213 participants were enrolled at 459 sites: 3,609 patients were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban and 3,604 to receive aspirin. Recurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism was not different between the 2 groups. However, major bleeding occurred in 62 patients in the rivaroxaban group (annualized rate, 1.8%) and in 23 in the aspirin group (annualized rate, 0.7%) (P<0.001). It was concluded that rivaroxaban was not superior to aspirin with regard to the prevention of recurrent stroke after an initial ESUS and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
213
 The reason why rivaroxaban could not show superiority to aspirin remains unclear. Recent improvement in diagnostic technology for undiagnosed AF might lead to enrollment of fewer patients in whom stroke was caused by AF. In RE‐SPECT ESUS, among patients with a recent history of ESUS, dabigatran was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke. The incidence of major bleeding was not greater in the dabigatran group than in the aspirin group, but there were more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in the dabigatran group.

The recommendations and levels of evidence for detecting AF are described in Table 22. Pulse check is the simplest method. The Japanese Stroke Association (JSA) and the JHRS have annually determined March 9th as “A day for pulse”, and March 9–15th as “A week of AF”. On their website (http://www.shinbousaidou‐week.org/), JSA and JHRS emphasize the importance of pulse check.

In patients experiencing a cerebral infarction, the presence of AF is occasionally observed on 12‐lead ECG or monitor ECG after admission. EMBRACE
215
 randomly assigned 572 patients aged 55 years or older, without known AF, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24‐h ECG), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30‐day event‐triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24‐h monitor (control group). Within 90 days of randomization, AF lasting ≥30 s was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (P<0.001). CRYSTAL AF
216
 was a randomized, controlled study of 441 patients to assess whether long‐term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) was more effective than conventional follow‐up (control) for detecting AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke. By 6 months, AF had been detected in 8.9% of patients in the ICM group (19 patients) versus 1.4% of patients in the control group (3 patients) (P<0.001). By 12 months, AF had been detected in 12.4% of patients in the ICM group (29 patients) versus 2.0% of patients in the control group (4 patients) (P<0.001). Sposato et al
217
 reported studies that provided the number of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who were newly diagnosed with AF. They stratified the cardiac monitoring methods into 4 sequential phases of screening: phase 1 (emergency room) consisted of admission ECG; phase 2 (in hospital) comprised serial ECG, continuous inpatient ECG monitoring, continuous inpatient cardiac telemetry, and in‐hospital Holter monitoring; phase 3 (first ambulatory period) consisted of ambulatory Holter ECG; and phase 4 (second ambulatory period) consisted of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, external loop recording, and implantable loop recording. The summary proportions of patients diagnosed with post‐stroke AF were 7.7% in phase 1, 5.1% in phase 2, 10.7% in phase 3, and 16.9% in phase 4. The overall AF detection yield after all phases of sequential cardiac monitoring was 23.7%.
217
 The AF detection rate increases in proportion to the ECG monitoring period. However, some researchers question whether AF detected 1–2 years after cerebral infarction was really involved in the development of cerebral infarction. From 2016, ICM to detect AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke has been covered by insurance in Japan.

In patients with an implanted pacemaker or ICD, atrial high rate episodes (AHRE) can be detected by analysis of intracardiac ECG recordings. Most cases of AHRE can be considered to be AF. ASSERT
219
 enrolled 2,580 patients, aged ≥65 years, with hypertension and no history of AF, in whom a pacemaker or defibrillator had recently been implanted. The patients were monitored for 3 months to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (episodes of atrial rate >190 beats/min for >6 min) and followed them for a mean of 2.5 years for the primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. By 3 months, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias detected by implanted devices had occurred in 261 patients (10.1%), and were associated with an increased risk of clinical AF (P<0.001) and of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.007). In ASSERT, subclinical AF episodes varied in duration. In a subanalysis of ASSERT,
220
 among 2,455 patients during a mean follow‐up of 2.5 years, the longest single episode of subclinical AF lasted >6 min to 6 h in 462 patients (18.8%), >6–24 h in 169 (6.9%), and >24 h in 262 (10.7%). Subclinical AF duration >24 h was associated with a significant increased risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in patients with subclinical AF between 6 min and 24 h was not significantly different from that of patients without subclinical AF.

The documentation of AF on 12‐lead ECG recording is required for the diagnosis of AF. The recommendations and levels of evidence for diagnosis and evaluation of patients with AF is described in Table 23.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Diagnosis of AF

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with AF are described in Table 24.
21
 Death due to stroke can largely be mitigated by anticoagulation, but other cardiovascular deaths (e.g., due to heart failure or sudden death) remain common even in AF patients treated according to the current evidence base. AF is also associated with increased morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke. Contemporary studies show that 20–30% of patients with an ischemic stroke have had AF diagnosed before, during, or after the initial event. White matter lesions in the brain, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life (QOL), and depressed mood are common in AF patients, and between 10% and 40% of AF patients are hospitalized each year. Although most published studies have demonstrated associations between AF and impaired cognition, no AF treatment has yet been associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive decline or dementia.

Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality Associated With AF

This guideline proposes a 5‐step plan for acute and chronic management of patients with AF (Table 25).
21
 Firstly, if the patient presents with hemodynamic instability or and/or severe symptoms, urgent management is required, including cardioversion. Secondly, precipitating factors, including unfavorable lifestyle and underlying cardiovascular diseases should be managed. Thirdly, following assessment of thromboembolic risk, oral anticoagulants should be administered to patients at risk of thromboembolism. Fourthly, in patients with persistent and permanent AF, rate control <110 beats/min should be considered. Fifthly, following assessment of symptoms, the indication of a rhythm control strategy should be considered. In this regard, there are 4 options: antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion, catheter ablation and surgery. Through steps 1–4, improved life expectancy can be obtained. Through steps 1–5, improved QOL, autonomy and social functioning can be expected. Regarding step 5, recent studies have reported that improved life expectancy can be obtained by catheter ablation. In CASTLE‐AF,
232
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy. In CABANA,
233
 among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower‐than‐expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.
223
 In CABANA,
224
 catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, led to clinically important and significant improvements in QOL at 12 months.

GARFIELD‐AF
225
 was an observational study of adults with first‐diagnosed non‐valvular AF. The 2‐year outcomes of 17,162 patients prospectively enrolled in GARFIELD‐AF were analyzed. The mean age was 69.8 years, 43.8% were women, and the mean CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 3.3; 60.8% of patients were prescribed anticoagulant therapy with/without antiplatelet therapy, 27.4% antiplatelet monotherapy, and 11.8% no antithrombotic therapy. At 2‐year follow‐up, all‐cause death, stroke/systemic embolism, and major bleeding had occurred at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 3.83 (3.62; 4.05), 1.25 (1.13; 1.38), and 0.70 (0.62; 0.81) per 100 person‐years, respectively. Rates for all 3 major events were highest during the first 4 months. Congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, sudden/unwitnessed death, malignancy, respiratory failure, and infection/sepsis accounted for 65% of all known causes of death, and strokes for <10%. Anticoagulant treatment was associated with a 35% lower risk of death. In Japan, in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry,
226
 during a median follow‐up of 1,105 days, there were 705 all‐cause deaths (5.5%/year); 180 cardiovascular (CV) (26% of total deaths), 381 non‐CV (54%), and 144 undetermined causes (20%). The most common causes of CV and non‐CV death were heart failure (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis (17.3%), while mortality due to stroke was only 6.5%. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest indicator of CV death was pre‐existing heart failure and that of non‐CV death was anemia. Taken together, it is suggested that a more comprehensive approach to the management of non‐valvular AF may be needed to improve outcomes.

The expert consensus statement of the EHRA, HRS, Asia Pacific HRS, and the Latin American HRS summarizes the consensus of the international writing group and is based on a thorough review of the medical literature regarding cognitive function in arrhythmias.
227
 Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with or without a history of clinical stroke. Some of the reported brain morphometric changes include: hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and frontal medial lobe atrophy.
227
 Because the precise mechanism(s) of cognitive disorders in patients with AF is not fully known, the optimal way of preventing cognitive dysfunction for a given patient remains to be established. The expert consensus statement
227
 described the recommendations “may do this” for measures to prevent cognitive dysfunction in AF patients, as follows. (1) Appropriate anticoagulation in patients with AF and stroke risk factors should be applied for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. (2) Consider DOACs instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) when using oral anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke in AF, which may have a beneficial effect on subsequent cognitive disorders. (3) In patients with AF managed with long‐term VKA, a high anticoagulation time in therapeutic range may be beneficial for optimal prevention of new‐onset dementia. (4) General health measures (prevention of smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes, sleep apnea, and appropriate control of all risk factors) may reduce the concomitant risks of AF (new onset or recurrence) and stroke, with a putative benefit on cognitive function. (5) Prevention of cognitive dysfunction in AF may include general measures proposed in vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. (6) Cognitive assessment should be performed in AF patients whenever there is suspicion of cognitive impairment.

Heart failure (HF) and AF coincide in many patients. In the Japanese Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure,
228
 the management of AF is described as the initial part of comorbidity. In AF‐CHF,
229
 a total of 1,376 congestive HF patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm‐control group and 694 in the rate‐control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to death from cardiovascular cause, death from any cause, stroke, or worsening HF. It was concluded that for patients with AF and congestive HF, a routine strategy of rhythm control did not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate‐control strategy.Recently, however, catheter ablation for AF, as a rhythm‐control strategy, has shown remarkable improvements in efficacy and safety. In CASTLE‐AF,
222
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with HF was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening HF than was medical therapy. In response to the results of CASTLE‐AF, in the 2018 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias
4
 catheter ablation in AF patients with HF (LV dysfunction) was recommended as class IIa. In patients with HF with preserved or mid‐range ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFmrEF), AF was associated with similarly increased risk of death, HF hospitalization, and stroke or TIA.
230
, 
231
 Recently, catheter ablation of AF had reportedly similar effectiveness in patients with HF, regardless of the presence of systolic dysfunction.
232
, 
233
 In the study by Black‐Maier et al,
233
 there were no significant differences in procedural characteristics, arrhythmia‐free recurrence, or functional improvements between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. A large‐scale study is necessary to prove the effectiveness of catheter ablation in AF patients with HFpEF.

Approximately 30% of patients with AF have some form of valvular heart disease. Valvular heart disease is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk, Recently, the number of patients with mitral stenosis has drastically decreased, but with mitral regurgitation is increasing. It is very important to distinguish functional mitral regurgitation from the primary form. When valve dysfunction is severe, AF can be regarded as a marker for progressive disease, thus favoring valve repair or replacement. The Maze procedure to restore sinus rhythm should be considered.

Hypertension is a risk of new‐onset of AF, and promotes its progression. It also increases the risk of stroke. Sufficient antihypertensive treatment is required. There has been an argument that lowering blood pressure by angiotensin II‐receptor blockers may have more beneficial effects than using conventional Ca2+ channel blockers. In this regard, the J‐RHYTHM II study demonstrated that in patients with paroxysmal AF and hypertension, treatment of hypertension by candesartan did not have an advantage over amlodipine in reducing the frequency of paroxysmal AF.
234
 Similarly, in GISSI‐AF, treatment with valsartan was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of recurrent AF.
235

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a component of the CHADS2 score. Long disease duration leads to an increase in the risk of thromboembolism. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study,
153
 a total of 10,082 patients with DM were studied in a randomized, double‐blind fashion. Intensive glycemic control did not affect the rate of new‐onset AF. Nonetheless, patients with DM and incident AF had an increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared with those without AF.

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of obesity in AF patients is described in Table 26. Obesity promotes LV diastolic dysfunction, sympathetic activation and systemic inflammation.
236
 Conversely, stable weight loss decreases the AF burden and risk of AF recurrence.
236

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Managing Obese Patients With AF

Recommendations and levels of evidence for management of AF patients with obstructive sleep disorder are described in Table 27. Obstructive sleep disorder promotes AF, probably via hypoxemia, hypercapnia, inflammation, and exaggerated alteration of thoracic pressure, and autonomic dysfunction. When AF patients are suspected to have obstructive sleep disorder, further evaluation using multiple sleep latency tests is required. Following definitive diagnosis, appropriate management using continuous positive airway pressure is required.

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of AF patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are described in Table 28. AF is frequently associated with CKD. The proper dosage of each DOACs is set by renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance). Caution is required, because the level of creatinine clearance in patients with AF decreases over time.

### Classification of Atrial Fibrillation

In general, AF starts as the paroxysmal form. The duration and frequency of the episodes increase with time, until AF becomes persistent and permanent. AF can be classified as 1 of 5 forms as described in Figure 9, 
202
, 
203
 and Table 18.

AF that has not been diagnosed before. According to the clinical course, first‐diagnosed AF is classified as paroxysmal, persistent, long‐standing persistent or permanent. If first‐diagnosed AF terminates spontaneously, AF will not recur for several years in ≈50% of patients. In CARAF,
204
 899 first‐diagnosed AF patients were observed during a mean period of 4.1 years. Within 1 year, AF recurred in ≈50% of the patients. During the follow‐up period, 6–7% of the patients developed cerebral infarction.
204

Paroxysmal AF is AF that is self‐terminating, in most cases, within 48 h. Some AF paroxysms may continue for up to 7 days. In a Japanese study, during a mean follow‐up period of 14.1 years, paroxysmal AF eventually transited to the permanent form under conventional antiarrhythmic therapy (5.5% of patients per year).
205

AF that lasts longer than 7 days. The actuarial cumulative percentages of patients who maintained sinus rhythm after serial cardioversion treatment was reported to be 42% and 27% after 1 and 4 years, respectively.
206

Continuous AF lasting for ≥1 year, when it is decided to adopt a rhythm control strategy by cardioversion and/or catheter ablation.

AF that is accepted by the patient (and physician).

### Symptom Burden in Atrial Fibrillation, Cryptogenic Stroke and Embolic Strokes of Undetermined Source

The recommendation for the evaluation method of AF based on symptoms is given in Table 19. The modified European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) divides the original class 2 into mild (2a) or moderate (2b) effect
207
 (Table 20). Class 2b identifies patients with a health utility benefit of rhythm control; this modification may provide a threshold for potential treatment decisions. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Severity in Atrial Fibrillation (CCS‐SAF) scale is also available.

In a Japanese single‐center study,
206
 first‐diagnosed AF patients without structural heart disease (n=289) were reviewed with regard to 2 symptom classifications (CCS‐SAF and EHRA). In both classifications, asymptomatic patients comprised ≈40% of the patients. The Fushimi AF registry
207
 investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF (n=1,837) or persistent/permanent (sustained AF; n=1,912) subgroups. Multivariable analysis indicated that age (≥75 years), history of stroke/systemic embolism, male sex, and chronic kidney disease were independent determinants of asymptomatic status in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas age was nonsignificant in the sustained AF group. During the follow‐up period, all‐cause death was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group compared with symptomatic patients in the paroxysmal AF group, whereas it was comparable in the sustained AF group.
210

The term “cryptogenic stroke” refers to a stroke for which there is no specific attributable cause after a comprehensive evaluation.
211
 There is persuasive evidence that most cryptogenic strokes are thromboembolic. The thrombus is thought to originate from any of several well‐established potential embolic sources, including minor‐risk or covert cardiac sources, veins via paradoxical embolism, and non‐occlusive atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic arch or the cervical, or cerebral arteries. Accordingly, the term “embolic strokes of undetermined source” (ESUS) was proposed for a therapeutically relevant entity, which is defined as a non‐lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic source.
212
 The diagnostic criteria for ESUS are described in Table 21. Undiagnosed AF is considered to be one of the causes of ESUS. NAVIGATE ESUS tested the hypothesis that anticoagulant treatment with rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may result in a lower risk of recurrent stroke than aspirin.
213
 A total of 7,213 participants were enrolled at 459 sites: 3,609 patients were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban and 3,604 to receive aspirin. Recurrence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism was not different between the 2 groups. However, major bleeding occurred in 62 patients in the rivaroxaban group (annualized rate, 1.8%) and in 23 in the aspirin group (annualized rate, 0.7%) (P<0.001). It was concluded that rivaroxaban was not superior to aspirin with regard to the prevention of recurrent stroke after an initial ESUS and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
213
 The reason why rivaroxaban could not show superiority to aspirin remains unclear. Recent improvement in diagnostic technology for undiagnosed AF might lead to enrollment of fewer patients in whom stroke was caused by AF. In RE‐SPECT ESUS, among patients with a recent history of ESUS, dabigatran was not superior to aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke. The incidence of major bleeding was not greater in the dabigatran group than in the aspirin group, but there were more clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in the dabigatran group.

### Detection of Atrial Fibrillation

The recommendations and levels of evidence for detecting AF are described in Table 22. Pulse check is the simplest method. The Japanese Stroke Association (JSA) and the JHRS have annually determined March 9th as “A day for pulse”, and March 9–15th as “A week of AF”. On their website (http://www.shinbousaidou‐week.org/), JSA and JHRS emphasize the importance of pulse check.

In patients experiencing a cerebral infarction, the presence of AF is occasionally observed on 12‐lead ECG or monitor ECG after admission. EMBRACE
215
 randomly assigned 572 patients aged 55 years or older, without known AF, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24‐h ECG), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30‐day event‐triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24‐h monitor (control group). Within 90 days of randomization, AF lasting ≥30 s was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (P<0.001). CRYSTAL AF
216
 was a randomized, controlled study of 441 patients to assess whether long‐term monitoring with an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) was more effective than conventional follow‐up (control) for detecting AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke. By 6 months, AF had been detected in 8.9% of patients in the ICM group (19 patients) versus 1.4% of patients in the control group (3 patients) (P<0.001). By 12 months, AF had been detected in 12.4% of patients in the ICM group (29 patients) versus 2.0% of patients in the control group (4 patients) (P<0.001). Sposato et al
217
 reported studies that provided the number of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who were newly diagnosed with AF. They stratified the cardiac monitoring methods into 4 sequential phases of screening: phase 1 (emergency room) consisted of admission ECG; phase 2 (in hospital) comprised serial ECG, continuous inpatient ECG monitoring, continuous inpatient cardiac telemetry, and in‐hospital Holter monitoring; phase 3 (first ambulatory period) consisted of ambulatory Holter ECG; and phase 4 (second ambulatory period) consisted of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, external loop recording, and implantable loop recording. The summary proportions of patients diagnosed with post‐stroke AF were 7.7% in phase 1, 5.1% in phase 2, 10.7% in phase 3, and 16.9% in phase 4. The overall AF detection yield after all phases of sequential cardiac monitoring was 23.7%.
217
 The AF detection rate increases in proportion to the ECG monitoring period. However, some researchers question whether AF detected 1–2 years after cerebral infarction was really involved in the development of cerebral infarction. From 2016, ICM to detect AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke has been covered by insurance in Japan.

In patients with an implanted pacemaker or ICD, atrial high rate episodes (AHRE) can be detected by analysis of intracardiac ECG recordings. Most cases of AHRE can be considered to be AF. ASSERT
219
 enrolled 2,580 patients, aged ≥65 years, with hypertension and no history of AF, in whom a pacemaker or defibrillator had recently been implanted. The patients were monitored for 3 months to detect subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (episodes of atrial rate >190 beats/min for >6 min) and followed them for a mean of 2.5 years for the primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism. By 3 months, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias detected by implanted devices had occurred in 261 patients (10.1%), and were associated with an increased risk of clinical AF (P<0.001) and of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.007). In ASSERT, subclinical AF episodes varied in duration. In a subanalysis of ASSERT,
220
 among 2,455 patients during a mean follow‐up of 2.5 years, the longest single episode of subclinical AF lasted >6 min to 6 h in 462 patients (18.8%), >6–24 h in 169 (6.9%), and >24 h in 262 (10.7%). Subclinical AF duration >24 h was associated with a significant increased risk of subsequent stroke or systemic embolism (P=0.003). The risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in patients with subclinical AF between 6 min and 24 h was not significantly different from that of patients without subclinical AF.

### Integrated Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

The documentation of AF on 12‐lead ECG recording is required for the diagnosis of AF. The recommendations and levels of evidence for diagnosis and evaluation of patients with AF is described in Table 23.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Diagnosis of AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; ECG, electrocardiogram.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with AF are described in Table 24.
21
 Death due to stroke can largely be mitigated by anticoagulation, but other cardiovascular deaths (e.g., due to heart failure or sudden death) remain common even in AF patients treated according to the current evidence base. AF is also associated with increased morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke. Contemporary studies show that 20–30% of patients with an ischemic stroke have had AF diagnosed before, during, or after the initial event. White matter lesions in the brain, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life (QOL), and depressed mood are common in AF patients, and between 10% and 40% of AF patients are hospitalized each year. Although most published studies have demonstrated associations between AF and impaired cognition, no AF treatment has yet been associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive decline or dementia.
221

Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality Associated With AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; LV, left ventricular. (Modified from Kirchhof P, et al. 2016.
21
)

This guideline proposes a 5‐step plan for acute and chronic management of patients with AF (Table 25).
21
 Firstly, if the patient presents with hemodynamic instability or and/or severe symptoms, urgent management is required, including cardioversion. Secondly, precipitating factors, including unfavorable lifestyle and underlying cardiovascular diseases should be managed. Thirdly, following assessment of thromboembolic risk, oral anticoagulants should be administered to patients at risk of thromboembolism. Fourthly, in patients with persistent and permanent AF, rate control <110 beats/min should be considered. Fifthly, following assessment of symptoms, the indication of a rhythm control strategy should be considered. In this regard, there are 4 options: antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion, catheter ablation and surgery. Through steps 1–4, improved life expectancy can be obtained. Through steps 1–5, improved QOL, autonomy and social functioning can be expected. Regarding step 5, recent studies have reported that improved life expectancy can be obtained by catheter ablation. In CASTLE‐AF,
232
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy. In CABANA,
233
 among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower‐than‐expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.
223
 In CABANA,
224
 catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, led to clinically important and significant improvements in QOL at 12 months.

GARFIELD‐AF
225
 was an observational study of adults with first‐diagnosed non‐valvular AF. The 2‐year outcomes of 17,162 patients prospectively enrolled in GARFIELD‐AF were analyzed. The mean age was 69.8 years, 43.8% were women, and the mean CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 3.3; 60.8% of patients were prescribed anticoagulant therapy with/without antiplatelet therapy, 27.4% antiplatelet monotherapy, and 11.8% no antithrombotic therapy. At 2‐year follow‐up, all‐cause death, stroke/systemic embolism, and major bleeding had occurred at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 3.83 (3.62; 4.05), 1.25 (1.13; 1.38), and 0.70 (0.62; 0.81) per 100 person‐years, respectively. Rates for all 3 major events were highest during the first 4 months. Congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, sudden/unwitnessed death, malignancy, respiratory failure, and infection/sepsis accounted for 65% of all known causes of death, and strokes for <10%. Anticoagulant treatment was associated with a 35% lower risk of death. In Japan, in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry,
226
 during a median follow‐up of 1,105 days, there were 705 all‐cause deaths (5.5%/year); 180 cardiovascular (CV) (26% of total deaths), 381 non‐CV (54%), and 144 undetermined causes (20%). The most common causes of CV and non‐CV death were heart failure (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis (17.3%), while mortality due to stroke was only 6.5%. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest indicator of CV death was pre‐existing heart failure and that of non‐CV death was anemia. Taken together, it is suggested that a more comprehensive approach to the management of non‐valvular AF may be needed to improve outcomes.

The expert consensus statement of the EHRA, HRS, Asia Pacific HRS, and the Latin American HRS summarizes the consensus of the international writing group and is based on a thorough review of the medical literature regarding cognitive function in arrhythmias.
227
 Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with or without a history of clinical stroke. Some of the reported brain morphometric changes include: hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and frontal medial lobe atrophy.
227
 Because the precise mechanism(s) of cognitive disorders in patients with AF is not fully known, the optimal way of preventing cognitive dysfunction for a given patient remains to be established. The expert consensus statement
227
 described the recommendations “may do this” for measures to prevent cognitive dysfunction in AF patients, as follows. (1) Appropriate anticoagulation in patients with AF and stroke risk factors should be applied for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. (2) Consider DOACs instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) when using oral anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke in AF, which may have a beneficial effect on subsequent cognitive disorders. (3) In patients with AF managed with long‐term VKA, a high anticoagulation time in therapeutic range may be beneficial for optimal prevention of new‐onset dementia. (4) General health measures (prevention of smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes, sleep apnea, and appropriate control of all risk factors) may reduce the concomitant risks of AF (new onset or recurrence) and stroke, with a putative benefit on cognitive function. (5) Prevention of cognitive dysfunction in AF may include general measures proposed in vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. (6) Cognitive assessment should be performed in AF patients whenever there is suspicion of cognitive impairment.

### Diagnosis and Evaluation of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

The documentation of AF on 12‐lead ECG recording is required for the diagnosis of AF. The recommendations and levels of evidence for diagnosis and evaluation of patients with AF is described in Table 23.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Diagnosis of AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; ECG, electrocardiogram.

### Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality Associated With Atrial Fibrillation

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with AF are described in Table 24.
21
 Death due to stroke can largely be mitigated by anticoagulation, but other cardiovascular deaths (e.g., due to heart failure or sudden death) remain common even in AF patients treated according to the current evidence base. AF is also associated with increased morbidity, such as heart failure and stroke. Contemporary studies show that 20–30% of patients with an ischemic stroke have had AF diagnosed before, during, or after the initial event. White matter lesions in the brain, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life (QOL), and depressed mood are common in AF patients, and between 10% and 40% of AF patients are hospitalized each year. Although most published studies have demonstrated associations between AF and impaired cognition, no AF treatment has yet been associated with a reduced incidence of cognitive decline or dementia.

### Five‐Step Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

This guideline proposes a 5‐step plan for acute and chronic management of patients with AF (Table 25).
21
 Firstly, if the patient presents with hemodynamic instability or and/or severe symptoms, urgent management is required, including cardioversion. Secondly, precipitating factors, including unfavorable lifestyle and underlying cardiovascular diseases should be managed. Thirdly, following assessment of thromboembolic risk, oral anticoagulants should be administered to patients at risk of thromboembolism. Fourthly, in patients with persistent and permanent AF, rate control <110 beats/min should be considered. Fifthly, following assessment of symptoms, the indication of a rhythm control strategy should be considered. In this regard, there are 4 options: antiarrhythmic drugs, cardioversion, catheter ablation and surgery. Through steps 1–4, improved life expectancy can be obtained. Through steps 1–5, improved QOL, autonomy and social functioning can be expected. Regarding step 5, recent studies have reported that improved life expectancy can be obtained by catheter ablation. In CASTLE‐AF,
232
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with heart failure was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure than was medical therapy. In CABANA,
233
 among patients with AF, the strategy of catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, did not significantly reduce the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. However, the estimated treatment effect of catheter ablation was affected by lower‐than‐expected event rates and treatment crossovers, which should be considered in interpreting the results of the trial.
223
 In CABANA,
224
 catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, led to clinically important and significant improvements in QOL at 12 months.

### Causes of Death in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

GARFIELD‐AF
225
 was an observational study of adults with first‐diagnosed non‐valvular AF. The 2‐year outcomes of 17,162 patients prospectively enrolled in GARFIELD‐AF were analyzed. The mean age was 69.8 years, 43.8% were women, and the mean CHA2DS2‐VASc score was 3.3; 60.8% of patients were prescribed anticoagulant therapy with/without antiplatelet therapy, 27.4% antiplatelet monotherapy, and 11.8% no antithrombotic therapy. At 2‐year follow‐up, all‐cause death, stroke/systemic embolism, and major bleeding had occurred at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 3.83 (3.62; 4.05), 1.25 (1.13; 1.38), and 0.70 (0.62; 0.81) per 100 person‐years, respectively. Rates for all 3 major events were highest during the first 4 months. Congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, sudden/unwitnessed death, malignancy, respiratory failure, and infection/sepsis accounted for 65% of all known causes of death, and strokes for <10%. Anticoagulant treatment was associated with a 35% lower risk of death. In Japan, in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry,
226
 during a median follow‐up of 1,105 days, there were 705 all‐cause deaths (5.5%/year); 180 cardiovascular (CV) (26% of total deaths), 381 non‐CV (54%), and 144 undetermined causes (20%). The most common causes of CV and non‐CV death were heart failure (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis (17.3%), while mortality due to stroke was only 6.5%. In the multivariate analysis, the strongest indicator of CV death was pre‐existing heart failure and that of non‐CV death was anemia. Taken together, it is suggested that a more comprehensive approach to the management of non‐valvular AF may be needed to improve outcomes.

### Atrial Fibrillation and Cognitive Function

The expert consensus statement of the EHRA, HRS, Asia Pacific HRS, and the Latin American HRS summarizes the consensus of the international writing group and is based on a thorough review of the medical literature regarding cognitive function in arrhythmias.
227
 Evidence suggests that AF is associated with a higher risk for cognitive impairment and dementia, with or without a history of clinical stroke. Some of the reported brain morphometric changes include: hippocampal atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, and frontal medial lobe atrophy.
227
 Because the precise mechanism(s) of cognitive disorders in patients with AF is not fully known, the optimal way of preventing cognitive dysfunction for a given patient remains to be established. The expert consensus statement
227
 described the recommendations “may do this” for measures to prevent cognitive dysfunction in AF patients, as follows. (1) Appropriate anticoagulation in patients with AF and stroke risk factors should be applied for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction. (2) Consider DOACs instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) when using oral anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke in AF, which may have a beneficial effect on subsequent cognitive disorders. (3) In patients with AF managed with long‐term VKA, a high anticoagulation time in therapeutic range may be beneficial for optimal prevention of new‐onset dementia. (4) General health measures (prevention of smoking, hypertension, obesity and diabetes, sleep apnea, and appropriate control of all risk factors) may reduce the concomitant risks of AF (new onset or recurrence) and stroke, with a putative benefit on cognitive function. (5) Prevention of cognitive dysfunction in AF may include general measures proposed in vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. (6) Cognitive assessment should be performed in AF patients whenever there is suspicion of cognitive impairment.

### Management of Risk Factors and Comorbidity

Heart failure (HF) and AF coincide in many patients. In the Japanese Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure,
228
 the management of AF is described as the initial part of comorbidity. In AF‐CHF,
229
 a total of 1,376 congestive HF patients were enrolled (682 in the rhythm‐control group and 694 in the rate‐control group) and were followed for a mean of 37 months. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to death from cardiovascular cause, death from any cause, stroke, or worsening HF. It was concluded that for patients with AF and congestive HF, a routine strategy of rhythm control did not reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, as compared with a rate‐control strategy.Recently, however, catheter ablation for AF, as a rhythm‐control strategy, has shown remarkable improvements in efficacy and safety. In CASTLE‐AF,
222
 catheter ablation for AF in patients with HF was associated with a significantly lower rate of a composite endpoint of all‐cause death or hospitalization for worsening HF than was medical therapy. In response to the results of CASTLE‐AF, in the 2018 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias
4
 catheter ablation in AF patients with HF (LV dysfunction) was recommended as class IIa. In patients with HF with preserved or mid‐range ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFmrEF), AF was associated with similarly increased risk of death, HF hospitalization, and stroke or TIA.
230
, 
231
 Recently, catheter ablation of AF had reportedly similar effectiveness in patients with HF, regardless of the presence of systolic dysfunction.
232
, 
233
 In the study by Black‐Maier et al,
233
 there were no significant differences in procedural characteristics, arrhythmia‐free recurrence, or functional improvements between patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF. A large‐scale study is necessary to prove the effectiveness of catheter ablation in AF patients with HFpEF.

Approximately 30% of patients with AF have some form of valvular heart disease. Valvular heart disease is associated with an increased thromboembolic risk, Recently, the number of patients with mitral stenosis has drastically decreased, but with mitral regurgitation is increasing. It is very important to distinguish functional mitral regurgitation from the primary form. When valve dysfunction is severe, AF can be regarded as a marker for progressive disease, thus favoring valve repair or replacement. The Maze procedure to restore sinus rhythm should be considered.

Hypertension is a risk of new‐onset of AF, and promotes its progression. It also increases the risk of stroke. Sufficient antihypertensive treatment is required. There has been an argument that lowering blood pressure by angiotensin II‐receptor blockers may have more beneficial effects than using conventional Ca2+ channel blockers. In this regard, the J‐RHYTHM II study demonstrated that in patients with paroxysmal AF and hypertension, treatment of hypertension by candesartan did not have an advantage over amlodipine in reducing the frequency of paroxysmal AF.
234
 Similarly, in GISSI‐AF, treatment with valsartan was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of recurrent AF.
235

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a component of the CHADS2 score. Long disease duration leads to an increase in the risk of thromboembolism. In the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study,
153
 a total of 10,082 patients with DM were studied in a randomized, double‐blind fashion. Intensive glycemic control did not affect the rate of new‐onset AF. Nonetheless, patients with DM and incident AF had an increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared with those without AF.
153

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of obesity in AF patients is described in Table 26. Obesity promotes LV diastolic dysfunction, sympathetic activation and systemic inflammation.
236
 Conversely, stable weight loss decreases the AF burden and risk of AF recurrence.
236

Recommendation and Level of Evidence for Managing Obese Patients With AF

Recommendations and levels of evidence for management of AF patients with obstructive sleep disorder are described in Table 27. Obstructive sleep disorder promotes AF, probably via hypoxemia, hypercapnia, inflammation, and exaggerated alteration of thoracic pressure, and autonomic dysfunction. When AF patients are suspected to have obstructive sleep disorder, further evaluation using multiple sleep latency tests is required. Following definitive diagnosis, appropriate management using continuous positive airway pressure is required.

The recommendation and level of evidence for management of AF patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are described in Table 28. AF is frequently associated with CKD. The proper dosage of each DOACs is set by renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance). Caution is required, because the level of creatinine clearance in patients with AF decreases over time.

### Anticoagulation Therapy

Risk assessment for thromboembolism is important for the management of patients with AF in the clinical setting, especially when considering anticoagulation therapy (Table 29).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Risk Assessment of AF

*1Cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease), persistent and permanent AF, renal dysfunction, low body weight (≤50 kg), left atrial diameter (>45 mm). *2Older age (≥75 years), low body weight (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), antiplatelet use, and uncontrolled hypertension.

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CCr, creatinine clearance; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Valvular AF should be distinguished from non‐valvular AF because warfarin is the only oral anticoagulant (OAC) approved for valvular AF. The effectiveness or safety of DOACs for valvular AF has never been proven.
238
, 
239
 “Valvular” means rheumatic mitral valve diseases (predominantly mitral stenosis) and the postoperative state with mechanical prosthetic valves. So far, among artificial valves, bioprosthetic valves have been categorized as “valvular” in the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013).
2
 However, recent reports on the use of DOACs for patients with AF after bioprosthetic valve replacement have suggested that the efficacy of DOACs to prevent thromboembolism was comparable with that of warfarin;
240
, 
241
, 
242
 although the safety of DOACs for bleeding might have been superior to that of warfarin,
240
 the numbers of subjects were relatively small in those studies. According to this evidence, bioprosthetic valves were considered as “non‐valvular” in a joint consensus document from the heart rhythm associations of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America in 2017.
243
 The 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focuse update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline followed this standpoint.
244

In this guideline, the definition of “non‐valvular” is updated to include bioprosthetic valves. The postoperative state of mitral valve repair (mitral annulorrhaphy or annuloplasty) and non‐rheumatic mitral regurgitation are included as “non‐valvular”, similar to the latest guidelines.
2
 (Because the effect‐efficacy of DOACs was described as “the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF” in a statement of the virtues of medicine, the echocardiographic findings of valve stenosis and regurgitation have often misled physicians in an insured medical treatment.) Because DOACs have been approved for the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF, the definition of “non‐valvular” is important at the selection of DOAC or warfarin. Generally, there is no inconvenience to including all valvular diseases as “non‐valvular”, except mitral stenosis and mechanical prosthetic valves.

In patients with non‐valvular AF (NVAF), because the accumulation of risk factors for thromboembolism increases the incidence of cardiogenic ischemic stroke,
245
, 
246
 it is recommended to determine appropriate anticoagulation therapy based on the risk assessment for thromboembolism. Assessments using risk scores have the advantage of standardization of risks evaluated by each physician.

In the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013),
2
 the CHADS2 score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 30)
245
 This score assigns 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (maximum 6 points). The risks for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score are stratified as low, intermediate, and high for scores of 0, 1, and ≥2, respectively.

CHADS2 Score

Maximum score: 6.

Abbreviation: TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Gage BF, et al. 2001.245)

In the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
247
 the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 31).
248
 This score comprises age ≥75 years and a history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism for 2 points and the other components of the CHADS2 score, vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), age 65–74 years, and sex category (female sex) for 1 point (maximum 9 points). In the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study
249
 cited in the ESC guidelines,
244
 factors in addition to the CHADS2 score showed a significant risk for thromboembolism. Consequently, the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted again in the 2016 ESC guidelines developed in collaboration with EACTS.
21
 This score was also adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline
250
 in the USA and by the Asian Pacific Heart Rhythm Society.

CHA2DS2‐VASc Score

Maximum score: 9.

Abbreviation: TE, thromboembolism; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Lip GY, et al. 2010.
248
)

In contrast, the CHADS2 score
245
 was again adopted in this Japanese guideline as well as in the previous version of the guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 although opinions on which risk score is suitable for Japanese patients with NVAF differed among specialists. One principal reason is that the simple CHADS2 score should be propagated first, because the use of a risk score was not sufficiently widespread in the clinical setting when the latest guidelines were published (JCS 2013).
2
 Although the CHADS2 score has several problems and is imperfect, the risk score needs to be simple to encourage non‐specialists to continue active risk assessment.
251
 In addition, the factors added to the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) were not a significant risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database).
252
 Because a superior novel risk score of simplicity and predicability has not yet been established since the publication of the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 risk assessment for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score is the most suitable for Japanese patients for the moment. Other influential factors not included in the CHADS2 score can be thought of as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy as in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2

Components of the CHADS2 score
245
 were derived from patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy among the pooled data of 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) (n=3,432)
253
, 
254
, 
255
 and the first 2 trials in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) (n=2,012).
256
, 
257
, 
258
 Age, hypertension, prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA), and diabetes mellitus were detected from the AFI, whereas hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >160 mmHg), prior cerebral ischemia, recent heart failure, and women aged ≥75 years were detected as risk factors for ischemic stroke from SPAF III. These factors were amalgamated and used to determine the 5 factors in the current CHADS2 score.
245
 This clinical classification scheme was validated using data from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) consisting of 1,733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–95 years with NVAF who were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.
245
 The incidence rate of ischemic stroke per 100 patient‐years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 for each 1‐point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 for a score of 0, 2.8 for 1, 4.0 for 2, 5.9 for 3, 8.5 for 4, 12.5 for 5, and 18.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11A).
245
 Although these rates are often used as the gold standard for informed consent, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy in a pooled analysis of the 3 major AF registries
252
 were obviously lower than those in the original report by Gage et al
245
 and in other reports
259
 from foreign countries: 0.5 for a score of 0, 0.9 for 1, 1.5 for 2, 2.7 for 3, 6.1 for 4, 3.9 for 5, and 7.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11B).
252
 Therefore, the original incidence rates
245
 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current Japanese patients. The original rates should be interpreted cautiously because all subjects in the NRAF used for validation of the CHADS2 score were older (range, 65–95; mean, 81 years) and standard therapeutic drugs for hypertension and heart failure were different from those used today.

)

Although the CHADS2 score consists of 5 factors, only 3 (hypertension, age ≥75 years, and a history of stroke or TIA) were identified as significant risks for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database),
252
 and congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus were not (Table 32).

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF. The risk for thromboembolism is comparable between patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved EF (HFpEF).
231
 In phase III trials using DOACs,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 HF was defined as either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or more, or HF symptoms within previous 3–6 months.

Possible reasons why HF was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism include the difference in current standard therapeutic drugs for HF compared with the 1990s, HF being a stronger risk factor for all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths rather than for thromboembolism,
264
 and the severity or duration of HF not taken into consideration.
265
, 
266
 In a subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial,
265
 severe HF with NYHA class III or IV was a significant risk factor for thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.88). In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267
 Therefore, the definition of hypertension in the CHADS2 score includes a history of hypertension in addition to the criteria of hypertension in those days of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg. Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,
269
 and the ARISTOTLE trial.
270
 In contrast, in a subanalysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
271
 neither hypertension (including its history and/or under treatment) nor BP value at the time of enrollment was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, but the incidence of thromboembolism in the highest quartile of systolic BP (≥136 mmHg) at the time closest to the event was significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile (<114 mmHg) (odds ratio 2.88, 95% CI 1.75–4.74). A subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry
272
 also showed that event rates in patients with hypertension were comparable to those without hypertension, but the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with a baseline systolic BP ≥150 mmHg was significantly higher than in those with adequate BP control.

Given that patients with inadequate BP control have consistently indicated high event rates in all studies,
269

 including trials in which hypertension was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism,
271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271
, 
275
 The reason can be speculated as the control status of blood glucose levels or the recent progression of oral hypoglycemic agents not being reflected in these results, but the precise causes remain unknown. However, HRs were >1.0 in most studies.
249
, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

In the latest vision of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 cardiomyopathy, advanced age (65–74 years), and vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease) were listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy.

Advanced age (65–74 years) was a significant risk factor for stroke in the AFI
253
 and the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study.
249
 In the 2016 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
280
 patients aged ≥65 years are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy, regardless of other risk factors. It named the score as “CHADS65” due to attaching importance to age ≥65 years. However, it has not been identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in Japan, even though the HR was slightly high at 1.0–1.3.
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “vascular disease” including prior myocardial infarction,
253
 aortic plaque,
281
 and peripheral arterial disease
282
 was identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism and listed in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 these factors were not a significant risk for thromboembolism in Japanese patients.
252
, 
271
, 
275

In patients with “cardiomyopathy,” the coagulation system is often activated.
283
, 
284
 In some cohort studies of Japanese patients with NVAF, cardiomyopathy, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was reportedly an independent risk factor for stroke.
284
, 
285

Because being “female”
249
, 
253
 had proved not to be a solo risk factor in AF patients aged <65 years without other organic diseases,
247
, 
274
, 
286
 it was deleted in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2
 Subsequently, given that female sex was not detected as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in subanalyses of both the J‐RHYTHM Registry
287
 and the Fushimi AF Registry,
288
 it was determined not to describe this as a solo risk factor in this guideline. It seems reasonable that female sex is dealt with as a modifier of other risk factors independent of sex.
289
, 
290

“Thyrotoxicosis” is not considered as a risk factor for thromboembolism, as described in the previous version of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 because thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism has not been sufficiently validated as a solo risk factor for thromboembolism.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,
291
, 
292
 the risk for thromboembolism in patients with persistent or permanent AF is reportedly higher than that in those with paroxysmal AF in subanalyses of phase III trials using DOACs
293
, 
294
, 
295
, 
296
 and the Fushimi AF Registry.
297
 In addition, the risk of adverse events was transiently elevated during the progression period from paroxysmal to sustained AF.
298

Among the findings of echocardiography, LV systolic function (LV fractional shortening <25%),
255
, 
257
 left atrial (LA) dysfunction,
299
 and LA diameter (>45 mm) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),
275
 and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (so‐called smoke‐like or moyamoya echo) in the LA, LA appendage thrombus, and peak LA appendage flow velocity (<20 cm/s)
281
 on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been reported as risk factors for thromboembolism.

“Low body weight (BW) or low body mass index (BMI)” and “renal dysfunction” often lead to issues in patients with AF, especially in elderly patients. In the Fushimi AF Registry, BW ≤50 kg
300
 and creatinine clearance (CCr) <30 mL/min
301
 were significant risk factors for thromboembolism. In contrast, in the J‐RHYTHM Registry, BMI <18.5 kg/m2 302 and CCr <30 mL/min
303
 were stronger risk factors for all‐cause death than for thromboembolism. Factors not included in the CHADS2 score in subanalyses of both registries are shown in Table 33.

Risk Factors for Thromboembolism Not Included in the CHADS2 Score

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; BMI, body mass index; BW, body weight; CCr, creatinine clearance; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LAD, left atrial diameter; OR, odds ratio.

Accordingly to these AF registry studies in Japan, in the present guideline persistent or permanent AF, low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction, and LA diameter (>45 mm) are newly listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy (Figure 12), in addition to cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), and vascular disease.

Anticoagulation therapy in AF. *

Bioprosthetic values are included in non‐valvular AF. *2Regarding anticoagulation according to renal function, see “3.2.3 Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants” and Table 36. *3Regarding target INR 1.6–2.6 in non‐valvular AF, INR close to 2.0 is recommended as possible. INR 2.0–3.0 may be considered in high‐risk patients aged <70 years with a history of stroke or CHADS2 score ≥3. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The predictive ability of a risk score for events is generally evaluated using the c‐statistic (or c‐index).
304
 C‐statistics of the schemas in the AFI and SPAF, which were used for derivations of the CHADS2 score, were 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, that in the NRAF used for validation was 0.82, which was higher than each of the values of the AFI or SPAF.
245
 Novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed by adding other factors such as the CHA2DS2‐VASc score,
248
 the R2CHADS2 score
305
 by adding renal dysfunction, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history) stroke risk score
306
 by adding biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], high‐sensitivity troponin T), and so on. However, because the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7, it is difficult to determine whether predictive ability has improved compared with that of the CHADS2 score.
245
 A validation study of the J‐RHYTHM Registry
289
 also demonstrated that the c‐statistic of either the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (0.595) or the CHA2DS2‐VA score (0.624), when female sex was removed, was not higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.638).

Approximately half of patients with NVAF correspond to a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1,
274
, 
307
 for which the effectiveness of warfarin has not been proven. The prevalence of patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 was reportedly 15.6% in the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
307
 and 11.2% in the Fushimi AF Registry.
308
 In patients with cerebral infarction, those with a CHADS2 score of 0 before the onset of stroke comprised 7.3% and were not necessarily rare in the SAMURAI‐NVAF.
309
 The CHADS2 score is limited for distinguishing low‐risk patients, but the CHA2DS2‐VASc score is thought to be useful to detect an especially true low‐risk one who may not require anticoagulation therapy.
310
, 
311
 It can be proposed that anticoagulation therapy is not needed for patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 0, except for females, who showed no risk for thromboembolism in Japan.
287
, 
288
, 
289

In patients with NVAF, risk assessment for bleeding is important for the determination of anticoagulation therapy and to prevent bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy.

The HAS‐BLED score (Table 34)
312
 was adopted in the ESC guidelines in 2010 as a risk score for predicting bleeding.
282
 Comparing to the HEMORR2HAGES score published in 2006,
313
 this score is able to evaluate bleeding risks more simply and accurately in the clinical setting.
314
 The incidence rates of major bleeding per 100 patient‐years in each HAS‐BLED score were reportedly 1.13 for a score of 0, 1.02 for 1, 1.88 for 2, 3.74 for 3, 8.70 for 4, and 12.50 for 5,
312
 and a high risk was defined as a score ≥3. Because hypertension, prior stroke, and advanced age were mutual factors in the CHADS2 score,
245
 high‐risk patients for bleeding are also at high risk for thromboembolism.
315
 However, note that the definitions of risk factors in the HAS‐BLED score differ from those in the CHADS2 score. In the HAS‐BLED score, hypertension is defined as uncontrolled in patients with systolic BP >160 mmHg and advanced age is defined as >65 years. Labile international normalized ratio (INR) assumed that patients receive warfarin. Although novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed, such as the ATRIA hemorrhagic risk score,
316
 simplified by omitting INR, the ORBIT score,
317
 and the ABC bleeding risk score by adding biomarkers,
318
 the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7 and thus, the predictive ability has not markedly improved.

HAS‐BLED Score

Maximum score: 9.

*1Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg. *2Abnormal renal function is defined as chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or serum creatinine ≥200 μmol/L (2.26 mg/dL). Abnormal liver function is defined as chronic hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant hepatic derangement (e.g., bilirubin >2×upper limit of normal, in association with AST/ALT/ALP >3×upper limit normal). *3Bleeding refers to previous bleeding history and/or predisposition to bleeding (e.g., bleeding diathesis, anemia). *4Labile INR refers to unstable/high INR or poor time in therapeutic range (i.e., <60%). *5Drugs/alcohol use refers to concomitant use of drugs, such as antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or alcohol abuse.

Abbreviation: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio.

In actual clinical practice, especially during anticoagulation therapy, it is important to assess bleeding risks using the “major risk factors for bleeding” as listed below since the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 and to control those factors suitable for intervention among the “factors related to intracranial hemorrhage” also listed below.

According to the results from a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial,
319
 a post marketing surveillance of dabigatran,
320
 and some domestic AF registry studies,
321
, 
322
 older age (≥75 years), low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), and antiplatelet use are major risk factors for bleeding during anticoagulation therapy. In patients receiving dabigatran, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and concomitant use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors are also risk factors for major bleeding (HR ≥3).
320
 In the present guideline, “uncontrolled hypertension” has been newly added as a major risk factor, based on results from the ROCKET AF trial,
269
 ARISTOTLE trial,
270
 and subanalyses of the Japanese AF registry studies.
271
, 
272
 Physicians should watch for critical bleeding complications in these high‐risk patients regardless of the anticoagulant used.

In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, age, prior stroke or TIA, use of aspirin or warfarin, and not being Caucasian were identified as factors related to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
323
 To date, hypertension, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, East Asian ethnicity, hypocholesterolemia, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, advanced age, prior cerebral infarction, and cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been identified as risk factors related to the development of ICH. Hypertension, prior cerebral infarction, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, hyperglycemia, and antithrombotic therapy were reportedly predisposing factors for enlargement of the ICH.
324
, 
325
, 
326
 To prevent the incidence of ICH, the use of DOACs with a low risk for ICH, adequate control of BP and blood glucose levels, abstention from smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and avoiding antiplatelet use could be recommended.
238
, 
327

In actual clinical practice, it is crucial to assess the risks for both thromboembolism and bleeding in individual patients and to select treatments that lead to a net clinical benefit
329
 based on a consideration of the risks and benefits.

A direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran,
260
 and factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban,
261
 apixaban,
262
 and edoxaban
263
 have been approved in Japan as oral anticoagulants with indications for prevention of ischemic stroke in AF, and are now available in daily clinical practice. These were first named as “new oral anticoagulants”, but have been called with several different names in contrast with VKA.
22
 Here, we call them DOACs.
330

DOACs have several advantages compared with warfarin, including fixed dosing, no need for regular blood sampling for dose adjustment, low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), less frequency of interactions with food and other drugs, rapid onset of action, and relatively short half‐life, all of which accordingly lead to no need or shortening of heparin replacement in the perioperative period. On the other hand, DOACs have several disadvantages, including a contraindication in severe renal dysfunction, rapid offset of action if a dose is missed, due to their short half‐life, no adequate measures for severe bleeding under anticoagulation therapy, and increased cost burden by patients. Among these, measures for severe bleeding have been partially established due to the recent development of antidotes for DOACs

335
 (see Section 3.6).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Anticoagulation for AF

*It has been reported that the threshold TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC).
359
 However, the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CCr, creatinine clearance; COR, class of recommendation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; NVAF, non‐valvular atrial fibrillation; PT‐INR, prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio; TTR, time in therapeutic range.

Selection of DOACs for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation According to Renal Function

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; HD, hemodialysis.

When oral anticoagulation is started in a patient with AF who is indicated for a DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) among patients with normal renal function to mild renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [CCr] ≥30 mL/min), a DOAC is recommended as the first choice in preference to a VKA,
21
 because of the convenience of drug prescription, stability of drug effects, low frequency of interactions with foods and other drugs, and the low incidence of ICH. The efficaciousness and safety of DOACs have been reported to be equal or superior to warfarin in randomized clinical trials with both Asian (including Japanese) and non‐Asian subjects or in observational studies with Japanese.
346
, 
348
, 
349
, 
360
, 
361
, 
362

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 Meanwhile, small‐sized studies of DOAC usage in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have accumulated.
240
, 
241
, 
242
 However, during the 3 months after valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended, even in patients with sinus rhythm,
363
 and studies of AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have excluded this time period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

DOACs are contraindicated for patients with severe renal dysfunction (CCr <30 mL/min for dabigatran, and CCr <15 mL/min for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban)
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 (Table 37). Therefore, in AF patients with CCr <15 mL/min, warfarin is the only anticoagulant that can be selected for prevention of ischemic stroke. However, warfarin has a relative contraindication for patients with severe renal impairment on the package insert.
364
 The bleeding risk with warfarin usage in AF patients with severe renal impairment is extremely high, which may offset the merit of preventing ischemic stroke.
365

Dosage and Administration of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation

•CCr <50 mL/min•P‐glycoprotein inhibitors

•Age ≥70 years•History of gastrointestinal bleeding (for dabigatran, dose reduction is considered, but not required)

2 of the following:

•Serum Cr ≥1.5 mg/dL

•Age ≥80 years•Body weight ≤60 kg

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance.

When anticoagulation is considered for patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), the indication should be carefully considered. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy recommends that administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication because it increases not only bleeding events but also thromboembolic events.
366
 The present guidelines also recommend that the administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication. However, in daily clinical practice, warfarin is widely used in the perioperative period of catheter ablation, in patients with mechanical valves, or in patients who need secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the present guidelines recommend that the administration of warfarin be considered for such cases, even for patients on maintenance HD.

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin but not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 In the present guidelines, AF with a history of valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is included as NVAF, which is indicated for DOAC usage. However, during the 3 months after a valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended even in patients with sinus rhythm
363
 and, meanwhile, studies evaluating the efficaciousness and safety of DOACs in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves
240
, 
241
, 
242
 excluded this period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

The differences in the pharmacological profiles of the DOACs are shown in Table 37.
367
 Several reviews have proposed flow charts for selection of DOACs based on their pharmacokinetic profiles, including metabolic pathways (renal excretion, hepatic excretion, and intestinal excretion) and number of doses, and the results of the subanalyses of phase III studies divided by the various patient backgrounds.
367
, 
368
, 
369
, 
370
 Of note, a review
367
 described Asian subanalyses including Japanese or a clinical trial with Japanese patients.
346
, 
348
, 
349
 However, although such flow charts may be useful for daily clinical practice, they cannot be regarded as absolute methods of choice because there have been no clinical trials that have directly compared among the DOACs.

It is essential to use DOACs with the dose and administration indicated in the package inserts (Tables 7 and 37), which have been determined through multiple clinical trials considering the characteristic pharmacokinetics for each DOAC. Moreover, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for stroke prevention by DOACs with on‐label dosing that are equal or superior to those of warfarin.
337

In daily clinical practice in Japan, there are more AF patients who are applicable for the dose reduction criteria of DOACs compared with Western countries due to high age and low body weight. Therefore, it is an issue in Japan whether the appropriateness of on‐label dosing may not be sufficiently validated in AF patients who are either older age or have mild to severe renal dysfunction; in such patients, evidence that verifies the appropriateness of on‐label dosing needs to accumulate. In the J‐ELD AF registry,
371
 which registered ∼3,000 Japanese elderly AF patients (≥75 years) under treatment with on‐label dosing of apixaban demonstrated similar efficiency and safety between the standard dose (n=1,284) and the reduced dose (n=1,747).

During warfarin administration, the intensity of anticoagulation effect is measured by the prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio (PT‐INR) and according to the PT‐INR, the dose of warfarin should be adjusted. In the JCS guidelines updated in 2013,
2
 the target range of PT‐INR was recommended as 1.6–2.6 for elderly patients (age ≥70 years)
353
 and 2.0–3.0 for younger patients (age <70 years). However, several reports from multicenter cohorts in Japan have demonstrated that clinicians targeted the PT‐INR range of 1.6–2.6, even in younger patients, presumably due to a fear of bleeding events.
307
, 
372

In the nationwide multicenter cohort of the J‐RHYTHM Registry, optimal PT‐INR under warfarin therapy was investigated using ∼8,000 AF patients. In that analysis, PT‐INR 1.6–2.6 was determined as the range in which both the risk of thromboembolism and major bleeding became minimal, regardless of elderly or younger patients.
350
, 
351
, 
352

Meanwhile, in studies of Japanese AF patients with acute ischemic stroke, the severity and prognosis after ischemic stroke according to PT‐INR at the time of the occurrence of ischemic stroke were evaluated.
354
, 
355
 In those studies, various measurements differed according to the PT‐INR, including the size of the infarction and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at the time of occurrence, and the severity of neural dysfunction or the prognosis of systemic function after ischemic stroke. In patients with PT‐INR 1.6–2.0, the measurements were similar to those with PT‐INR <1.6. Meanwhile, in patients with PT‐INR ≥2.0, the infarct size was small and the functional prognosis was relatively good.

Based on this evidence, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients without a history of ischemic stroke and having low thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≤2 points), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients. For this target range, the attending physician should aim to attain the middle (PT‐INR 2.0), but not the lower (1.6 or 1.7) value.

Meanwhile, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients with a history of ischemic stroke or having high thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≥3 points, or cancer patients), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years). Even in elderly patients, INR should be kept ≥2.0 as much as possible unless it threatens the safety for bleeding events.

As such, the present guidelines separate the optimal target range of warfarin therapy into primary prevention and secondary prevention: (i) in the former, the target range is 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients, and (ii) in the latter, the target range is 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years), which follows the target range in the previous guidelines.

The time in therapeutic range (TTR) is the measurement that calculates the percentage of time in which the PT‐INR under warfarin treatment is controlled within the target range.
374
 The TTR should be kept as high as possible. Although it has been reported that the threshold of TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC),
359
 the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and the thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

In the SAMURAI‐AF registry, which registered AF patients with a history of ischemic stroke, patients with optimal PT‐INR at the time of occurrence of ischemic stroke had a double risk of recurrence.
376
 In such cases, the patients may have a potential thrombophilia such as malignancy or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

DOACs have emerged as oral anticoagulants that do not need regular monitoring. Actually, in phase III trials, DOACs without regular monitoring showed similar efficacy and safety compared with warfarin with regular monitoring.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 However, it is recommended to measure the anticoagulation intensity of DOACs in high‐risk patients such as elderly patients, patients with renal dysfunction, and in patients who have experienced thromboembolism or bleeding events. However, it has not been well established how to interpret or how to respond to the results of the anticoagulation tests measured in daily clinical practice. Therefore, difficult cases should be referred to experts who have extensive experience with the prescription of DOACs (Table 38, 
330
, 
377

378
, 
379

Average Plasma Concentration and Response of Coagulation Tests for DOACs

Each DOAC has its own criteria of contraindication determined by renal function (Tables 36 and 37). Moreover, to determine the dose of DOACs, measurement of renal function is mandatory. In consideration of the pathogenesis or patient characteristics that may potentially decrease the coagulation activity (e.g., hemophilia,
356
 blood type O,
357
 etc.), a coagulation test before starting DOACs is encouraged. In hemophilia, the judgement for starting DOACs is based on the level of coagulation activity.
356

The bleeding complications after starting DOACs are concentrated in the first 3 months, but especially in the first month. Therefore, for early detection of bleeding, it is useful to check the temporal change in hemoglobin in elderly patients or patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also recommended to check changes in renal or liver function.

The 90% intervals of the distribution of the plasma concentration of DOACs at peak and trough in AF patients are shown in Table 38.

 The 90% intervals are known as the “on therapy range”,
381
, 
382
 which can indicate the optimal range of the plasma concentration of DOACs used in daily clinical practice. When the plasma concentration of the DOAC exceeds the 90% intervals, the bleeding risk may significantly increase.
383
, 
384
 Therefore, a coagulation test to measure the intensity of anticoagulation in the early phase after starting a DOAC is recommended. For this purpose, the hemoclot thrombin inhibitory assay (HTI) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are used for direct thrombin inhibitors, whereas the anti‐Xa assay (AXA) and prothrombin time (PT) are used for factor Xa inhibitors. However, measurement of PT for factor Xa inhibitors cannot be fully encouraged due to the wide variation in response according to the reagents used and the targeted factor Xa inhibitor.

When the prescription of DOACs continues for more than a few years, renal function gradually decreases over time.
385
 Therefore, measurement of renal function at least once per year is recommended.
330
, 
358
 Moreover, as most DOACs have hepatic metabolism, liver function should also be measured. For early detection of subclinical gastrointestinal bleeding, measurement of hemoglobin is also recommended. In elderly patients (≥75 years), blood testing at least once per 6 months is recommended. Moreover, in patients with CCr <60 mL/min, blood test once per X months (X=CCr/10) is recommended.

Two case–control studies reported that the risk of thromboembolic complication for cardioversion of AF without oral anticoagulation was 1–5%.

, 
387
 The risk is reduced by warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion.

 This anticoagulant regimen is applied for patients with AF ≥48 h duration or when the duration of AF is unknown. The duration of warfarin therapy is within the target range of PT‐INR; that is, we need more than 3 weeks before cardioversion if we start warfarin in naïve patients. The evidence of the safety of cardioversion of AF without anticoagulation in patients with AF duration <48 h is limited. Left atrial thrombus and thromboembolism can be induced by short‐term AF, but the necessity of anticoagulation is not determined.

In addition, post‐hoc analyses of a subset of patients undergoing cardioversion in phase 3 trials of approved DOACs,

 have evaluated the safety and efficacy of DOACs for cardioversion as an alternative to warfarin. The results were consistent and supported the idea that DOACs are an alternative to warfarin for patients undergoing cardioversion. For naïve patients, DOACs may be better for reducing the time before cardioversion, because the DOACs are effective from the day of starting, whereas warfarin takes at least several days to reach its therapeutic range. For patients with AF that requires immediate cardioversion because of hemodynamic instability in such clinical settings as angina, acute coronary syndrome, shock, or pulmonary edema, we should do it (if the duration of AF >48 h, with heparin i.v.) and should start and continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks.

After cardioversion and the restoration of sinus rhythm, functional recovery of the left atrium and left atrial appendage delay (i.e., atrial stunning) may take more than a few weeks.
402
 Meta‐analysis of 32 studies concerning cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter demonstrated that 98% of thromboembolic events occurred in the 10 days after cardioversion.
403
 The decision about long‐term anticoagulation therapy (beyond 4 weeks) is based on relapse of AF, which includes paroxysmal and asymptomatic forms, thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk (Figure 13).

Anticoagulant therapy for cardioversion. *2,000–5,000 U unfractionated heparin i.v. (evidence for the dose is poor). In case of AF lasting <48 h without anticoagulants, DOAC is recommended unless contraindicated as the effect of anticoagulation is rapid. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography.

An alternative to waiting 3 weeks before cardioversion is to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to exclude thrombus. In patients with AF ≥48 h duration, a RCT comparing cardioversion with and without TEE was performed (ACUTE trial).
404
 The traditional arm (n=603) was without TEE and administered warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion. In the TEE arm (n=619), immediate cardioversion was performed after heparin i.v. if no thrombus was detected in the left atrium. If a thrombus was detected, warfarin therapy was performed for 3 weeks. Cardioversion was performed if no thrombus was detected after reevaluation of TEE. Warfarin was continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. The number of days before cardioversion was significantly short in the TEE arm (mean 3.0 days vs 30.6 days), whereas the success rate of cardioversion and the rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding were not significantly different at 8 weeks after cardioversion. These results showed that TEE is an acceptable screening procedure for cardioversion of AF.
404

Prospective randomized trials with DOACs and warfarin for cardioversion of AF (X‐VerT, ENSURE‐AF, XANTUS, and EMANATE) included a TEE arm and confirmed the efficacy and safety.
395
, 
396
, 
397
, 
398
 If the risk of cerebral infarction is extremely high in patients with AF lasting <48 h, TEE is considered before cardioversion.

Cardioversion of atrial flutter also has the complication of cerebral infarction or systemic embolism, so anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or DOAC) should be applied as for AF before and after cardioversion.

Patients on anticoagulation therapy often undergo invasive procedures (e.g., examinations and treatments). Specific clinical departments that provide such invasive procedures face difficult decisions as to whether their patients need to be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulants during the perioperative period. Such decisions should be made on a patient‐by‐patient basis, taking several factors into account, such as the risk of thromboembolism, type of anticoagulant used, and the risk of bleeding associated with the particular invasive procedure to be performed. Physicians who are to perform such invasive procedures should consult with the clinic or hospital prescribing the anticoagulant to the patient to help decide whether the patient can be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulation therapy. Furthermore, they should also consult with the patient to explain the risks associated with interruption, specifically the risk of thromboembolism, and receive consent.

The categories of bleeding risks associated with invasive procedures performed across different specialties are shown in Table 39. In general, to prevent thromboembolism, interruption of anticoagulation therapy is not recommended for patients undergoing invasive procedures in which hemostasis is possible. For invasive procedures that require interruption of anticoagulation therapy, the period of interruption should be kept to a minimum and the treatment should be re‐initiated as soon as hemostasis is confirmed. The categories shown in Table 39 are based on standard invasive procedures; it should be noted that interruption may still be needed in high bleeding risk cases for procedures that are categorized as low risk of bleeding. It should also be noted that the guidelines are specific for elective invasive procedures and do not apply to emergency procedures. Recommendations and levels of evidence for continuation of anticoagulant therapy during invasive procedures are shown in Table 40.

Safety of continuing oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin for patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures was shown in several RCTs,
407
, 
408
, 
409
, 
410
 and a meta‐analysis.
411
 In the meta‐analysis, perioperative continuation of warfarin was not associated with an increased risk for clinically significant bleeding or minor bleeding, compared with interrupting warfarin therapy. A review showed that approximately 1% of patients with warfarin therapy discontinued specifically for dental procedures had serious embolic complications (including deaths).
412
 Therefore, continuation of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin in patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures is recommended.

Evidence regarding oral anticoagulant therapy using DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is lacking. In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, there was no significant difference in the rates of periprocedural ischemic stroke or systemic embolism between patients receiving dabigatran and those receiving warfarin (0.5% for both), who required surgery, including dental procedures.
413
 A study from Japan regarding the risk of bleeding in patients receiving a DOAC or warfarin without cessation reported that postoperative bleeding occurred in 4 extractions (3.1%) among 128 patients receiving DOACs (all extractions in DOAC patients were performed 6–7 h after taking the DOAC), and in 23 (8.8%) among 262 patients receiving warfarin, and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups.
414
 Thus, continuation of DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is recommended, as with the recommendation for warfarin.

It is reported that the incidence rate of stroke was approximately 1% in AF patients with adjusted anticoagulation (including withholding, reversal, or changing dose) who underwent endoscopy.
415
 In prospective observational studies, there was no significant difference for post‐procedural bleeding following endoscopy between patients with discontinued and continued anticoagulant therapy.
416
, 
417
 Diagnostic endoscopic procedures without biopsy can potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy, and expert opinion suggests that diagnostic endoscopy with biopsy can also potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy with controlled therapeutic INR,
418
, 
419
 but definite evidence is lacking. heparin bridging therapy for endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk significantly increased the risk of post‐procedural bleeding.
420
, 
421

The Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society published “Guidelines for gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing antithrombotic treatment” in 2012,
422
, 
423
 and an Appendix including DOACs in 2017.
424
, 
425
 The guideline classified gastroenterological endoscopic examination and treatment procedures according to bleeding risk into 4 categories: (i) diagnostic gastroenterological endoscopic procedures without biopsy, (ii) endoscopic mucosal biopsy (excluding endoscopic ultrasonography‐guided fine‐needle aspiration), (iii) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with low bleeding risk, and (iv) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk. For category (i), withdrawal of warfarin or DOAC is not required. For categories (ii–iv), warfarin withdrawal is not required but it should be confirmed that the PT‐INR is within the therapeutic range. For patients receiving DOACs in category (ii) or (iii), DOAC withdrawal is not required, but performing the procedure outside the peak DOAC blood concentration estimated from the time of administration is recommended. Patients receiving DOACs in category (iv) should discontinue the DOAC on the morning of the procedure. Oral administration of DOAC may be resumed on the morning after the procedure.

Although there was no established evidence or standard management approach during surgery with high bleeding risk, discontinuation of warfarin therapy and heparin bridging has been performed empirically during the perioperative period.
426
, 
427
 However, the BRIDGE trial showed that the incidence of arterial thromboembolism was comparable between the no‐bridging group (0.4%) and the bridging group (0.3%), and the incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower in the no‐bridging group (1.3%) compared with the bridging group.
428
 Some observational studies reported the similar results to the BRIDGE trial.
429
, 
430
 Generally, routine heparin bridging is not needed for patients with AF who require an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective invasive procedure with high bleeding risk.

On the other hand, heparin bridging is recommended to be considered for valvular AF patients (mechanical valve or rheumatic mitral stenosis), or non‐valvular AF patients at very high thromboembolic risk, such as history of ischemic stroke within 3 months or extremely high CHADS2 score. Analyses developed from the BRIDGE trial showed bridging to only be beneficial for patients with HAS‐BLED scores ≤2 and with CHA2DS2‐VASc scores of ≥6 (presumed CHADS2 score of ≥4).
431

A subanalysis of the international multicenter phase III trials of each DOAC regarding perioperative events has been published.
413
, 
432
, 
433
, 
434
 Meta‐analysis of these studies showed no significant difference in the risks of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, and overall mortality at 30 days following surgery or procedure between perioperative interruption of DOAC and interruption of warfarin.
435

In the case of invasive procedures that carry a high risk for major bleeding, it is recommended to take the last DOAC dose ≥48 h before surgery.
330
 For patients on dabigatran with CCR ≥80 mL/min, the last administration should be taken ≥48 h, for those with CCR 50–79 mL/min it should be taken ≥72 h, and for those with CCR 30–49 mL/min it should be taken ≥96 h before surgery.

Perioperative heparin bridging is not recommended in patients who discontinued DOACs before surgery.
330
 In a substudy of the RE‐LY trial, with dabigatran interruption, bridging was associated with significantly higher incidence of major bleeding than no‐bridging, but for any thromboembolic events there was no difference between bridging and no‐bridging.
436
 In general, heparin bridging in not needed during the interruption of DOAC therapy, but it can be considered in patients at very high thromboembolic risk as described above.

Two RCTs are available regarding bridging anticoagulation using warfarin in patients who required cardiac implantable electronic device surgery.
437
, 
438
 They concluded that a strategy of bridging therapy at the time of device implantation markedly increased the incidence of clinically significant device‐pocket hematoma as compared with continued warfarin treatment, and thromboembolic complications were rare and did not differ significantly between bridging therapy and continued warfarin treatment. Additionally, device‐pocket hematoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of infection requiring hospitalization.
439

There are several observational studies that show continued DOAC treatment during device implantation surgery was not significantly associated with increased incidence of clinically relevant bleeding events.
440
, 
441
, 
442

Patients undergoing AF ablation have a high risk of bleeding and thromboembolism, requiring appropriate anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period. Large‐scale observational studies of AF ablation demonstrated that cardiac tamponade and perforation are common hemorrhagic complications, with the incidence ranging from 1.2% to 2.5% and from 0.9% to 1,5%, respectively.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 The Japanese Catheter Ablation Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (J‐CARAF), which included 8,319 cases, also reported similar incidence rates.
447
 Thus, although technical advancements are expected, it remains essential to consider the risk of hemorrhagic complications. The risk of thromboembolism is further increased in left atrial ablation, with 0.1–0.3% of patients developing cerebral infarction during the perioperative period.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 Collectively, appropriate management of anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period is essential.

A recent international expert consensus recommended that warfarin be administered uninterrupted.
448
 This recommendation is based on evidence from an RCT (COMPARE trial) demonstrating that the use of warfarin reduced the risk of hemorrhagic complications in addition to that of embolism.
449

Similarly, recent RCTs have generated additional evidence on the use of DOACs. By comparing dabigatran (RE‐CIRCUIT trial),
450
 rivaroxaban (VENTURE‐AF trial),
451
 apixaban (AXAFA‐AFNET 5 trial),
452
 and edoxaban (ELIMINATE‐AF trial)
453
 with uninterrupted warfarin, they found that the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted administration of DOACs during the perioperative period are equivalent or superior to those of warfarin in terms of the risk of embolism and hemorrhagic complications. However, these studies included relatively small numbers of patients. In addition, variations in trial design should be noted; these variations included the half‐life of each DOAC and when the last dose was administered prior to the procedure.

There are limited data on minimally interrupted DOAC therapy, in which administration is interrupted 1–2 times prior to the procedure. An RCT conducted in Japan (ABRIDGE‐J trial) compared minimally interrupted dabigatran and uninterrupted warfarin, and demonstrated that the risk of hemorrhage was higher in the warfarin group, but the risk of embolism was equivalent between groups.
454
 Another Japanese single‐center RCT compared uninterrupted and minimally interrupted DOAC, and reported no significant difference in the incidence of embolism or hemorrhagic complications among the 4 DOACs, suggesting that minimal interruption is acceptable.
455
 A recent multicenter study conducted across hospitals in the Kyushu region (KYU‐RABLE study) also demonstrated that uninterrupted administration of edoxaban during the perioperative period (immediately after the procedure on the day of the surgery) is effective and safe.
456

Many factors should be considered in order to select the appropriate DOAC, as well as to determine whether interruption is needed (and if so, for how long) during the perioperative period for patients undergoing AF ablation. These factors include the patient‐specific risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and differences in drug metabolism and route of excretion among DOACs, in addition to the availability of neutralizing agents such as idarucizumab for dabigatran
332
 and Andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors (unapproved, as of March 2020).
457
 The “2018 JCS/JHRS Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias”
4
 should also be referred to.

The prevalence of the coexistence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported to be 8–15% in Japan,
307
, 
308
, 
362
, 
458
, 
459
 and these patients are encountered commonly in clinical practice. The JCS 2018 “Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome”
460
 and on “Revascularization of Stable Coronary Artery Disease”
461
 recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (P2Y12 inhibitor) after stent implantation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as class I/evidence level A. Therefore, in patients with AF concomitant with undergoing PCI, triple therapy defined as a DAPT plus an OAC for stroke prevention is needed. In 2019, the Academic Research Consortium proposed a consensus definition of patients at a high bleeding risk (HBR) among those undergoing PCI, which was based on a review of the available evidence. The use of OACs is fulfilled by the major criteria for HBR patients who are defined as having an annual incidence of bleeding events estimated to be >4%.
462
 Because the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy in these HBR patients would dramatically increase bleeding events, antithrombotic management focusing on the prevention of bleeding events is becoming the main trend worldwide.

The WOEST trial
463
 (n=573) was the first to test the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a VKA plus clopidogrel as a counterpart to the triple therapy of a VKA plus DAPT. Among the patients taking OACs and undergoing a PCI, dual therapy reduced the annual incidence of major bleeding more than the triple therapy, and surprisingly, the annual incidence of the composite cardiovascular events also lowered with the dual therapy. Regarding the benefit of VKA monotherapy as compared with dual therapy in AF patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), a nationwide Danish cohort registry provided insightful results that VKA monotherapy had a similar risk of a myocardial infarction/coronary death but decreased risk of serious bleeding events, as compared with dual therapy of a VKA plus aspirin or VKA plus clopidogrel.
464
 An open‐label randomized trial comparing an OAC alone (including four‐thirds of the patients taking warfarin and the remaining patients taking DOACs) and dual therapy with an OAC plus single antiplatelet in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI (OAC‐ALONE: Optimizing Antithrombotic Care in patients with AtriaL fibrillatiON and coronary stEnt study) was conducted in Japan.
465
 In that trial, there were no differences in the incidences of the primary endpoint (composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism) and major bleeding between the OAC alone therapy and dual therapy, which supported the results obtained from the nationwide Danish cohort study.
464

As DOACs are being increasingly used as an alternative to warfarin in clinical practice,
362
 the clinical evidence for DOACs in antithrombotic therapy management among AF patients undergoing PCI is becoming established. The PIONEER PCI trial
466
 compared the primary safety outcome and the occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke) between dual therapy with rivaroxaban 15 mg plus P2Y12 inhibitor (n=709) for 12 months and triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT adjusted for 1, 6, or 12 months (n=706). Similar to the WOEST trial, the dual therapy had a lower risk of clinically significant bleeding, but the rate of a major adverse cardiovascular event was similar between the dual and triple therapies. The RE‐DUAL PCI trial
467
 (n=2,725), which compared dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) over 12 months and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) with warfarin‐based triple therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (for 1–3 months), showed a similar result that the dual therapy had a lower risk of bleeding and was noninferior to the triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events. In the AUGUSTUS trial,
468
 4,614 AF patients who underwent PCI with a P2Y12 inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive apixaban or VKA and aspirin or a matching placebo for 6 months. The P2Y12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than the regimens that included VKA, aspirin, or both. The ENTRUST trial
469
 included 1,506 AF patients who had undergone PCI and were randomly assigned to either edoxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or VKA plus DAPT (for 1–12 months). The trial also showed consistent results of a bleeding risk reduction and an equivalent ischemic risk of the dual therapy as for the triple therapy. Although these 4 trials established the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor as compared with a warfarin‐based triple therapy in AF patients with CAD, the endpoints in the trials were only evaluated during a limited duration of 1 year after PCI.

Regarding the prognostic effect of DOACs in patients with stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI, the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic events with rivaroxaban in patiEnts with stable coronary artery disease Study) trial was published in 2019.
470
 This multicenter, open‐label trial conducted in Japan randomly assigned 2,236 patients with AF who had undergone PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban or a combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination‐therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, and surprisingly, the risk of the primary efficacy endpoint (composite of a stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause) was reduced by 28%, and was statistically noninferior to the combination therapy. Similar data, even for DOACs, supporting the results from the nationwide Danish registry
464
 and OAC‐ALONE trial
465
 were shown by this trial in Japan.

On the other hand, to explore the optimal duration of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy, the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial,
471
 a randomized open‐label study, was conducted. The result was that 6 weeks of triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after PCI in patients receiving an OAC was noninferior to 6 months of a triple therapy with respect to ischemic events and major bleeding events. Furthermore, in the WOEST trial
463
 and the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 as described above, the patients assigned to the dual therapy group were de‐escalated from a triple therapy to a dual therapy with a DOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor by cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase (maximum 2 weeks in the AUGUSTUS trial) after the PCI, which strongly supported the clinical acceptability of an early termination of aspirin after PCI. Meta‐analyses have also suggested that aspirin should be terminated early after PCI.
472
, 
473
 On the basis of these data in this field described above, this guideline recommends that the timing of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and clopidogrel should be within 2 weeks after PCI (Figure 14). The present European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines
21
, 
330
, 
474
 also consider dual therapy with clopidogrel and an OAC immediately after PCI as an alternative to triple therapy in those for whom the bleeding risk overweighs the ischemic risk, and dual therapy (aspirin is only used in the periprocedural phase after PCI) is recommended as a default strategy in the North American guidelines.
475

Recommended choice and duration of antithrombic therapy in atrial fibrillation concomitant with ischemic heart disease. *1Short duration of 6 months of dual therapy can be considered in patients with a very high bleeding risk. *2Continuation of dual therapy with an OAC and aspirin (or P2Y12 inhibitor) for longer than 12 months can be considered in patients with a very high thromboembolic risk. PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, OAC, oral anticoagulant.

Based on the increased evidence in this field as described above, this guideline provides a flow chart (Figure 14) and Table 41 for antithrombic management in AF patients with concomitant IHD.

 The P2Y12 inhibitors, ticagrelor and prasugrel (loading dose, 60 mg; maintenance dose, 10 mg in other countries) have been suggested to have a high bleeding risk.
482
, 
483
, 
484
 However, the approved dose of prasugrel was reduced (loading dose, 20 mg; maintenance dose, 3.75 mg) because East Asian individuals have a higher bleeding risk than Western individuals. Therefore, this guideline allows for the use of prasugrel when considering its use in clinical practice in Japan. While balancing between the thromboembolic‐vs.‐bleeding risk, a default strategy is de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor by ceasing aspirin within 2 weeks after PCI.

469
 and a subanalysis revealed a consistent benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and clopidogrel over a warfarin‐based triple therapy, regardless of ACS or stable CAD. Therefore, dual therapy is recommended as a default strategy even in patients with ACS. Nevertheless, the subanalysis of the AUGUSTUS trial demonstrated that a stent thrombosis at 1 month was numerically but not significantly lower in the triple therapy group with concomitant use of aspirin than in the dual therapy group after early cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase after PCI,
485
 implying the need for caution in patients with a very high risk of stent‐driven ischemic events. Therefore, triple therapy for longer than 1 month and up to 3 months by physicians’ discretion is acceptable in patients with a very high stent‐driven ischemic risk, as shown in Table 42.
330

475
 In contrast, triple therapy for longer than 1 month cannot be recommended in patients with a high bleeding risk (class III/evidence level B).

In the chronic phase beyond 1 year after PCI, an OAC alone can be recommended as a default strategy (class I/evidence level B), which is derived from the results of the AFIR trial, OAC‐ALONE trial, and the nationwide Danish cohort study.

 In limited numbers of patients with a very high thromboembolic risk, dual therapy with an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor (or aspirin) for longer than 1 year can be considered,
21
,

, 
461
,

, 
475
 but dual therapy should be considered to be shortened at 6 months in patients with a high bleeding risk.

The 4 phase III DOAC trials in AF patients included stable CAD in one‐third of the total patients and ACS in 15–20%,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 and reported the efficacy and safety of DOACs over warfarin even in those patients. The persistent benefit of DOACs over warfarin was observed in a database analysis, meta‐analysis, and registry in Japan.
479
, 
480
, 
481
 Furthermore, the AUGUSTUS trial
468
 indicated that apixaban had a similar efficacy and in particular, a bleeding risk, superior to warfarin. For these reasons, a DOAC should be used unless the patient has a contraindication (class I/evidence level A).
461
, 
474
, 
475
 Regarding the dose of each DOAC in the combined use as antiplatelet therapy, the lowest dose established for stroke prevention in the phase III DOAC AF trials should be used (class IIa/evidence level A).
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 When warfarin is used in combination with antiplatelet therapy, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be maintained in the lower part of the recommended target range and the time in the therapeutic range should be > 65% (class IIb/evidence level C). This is because significant increases in bleeding events were evident with VKA‐based triple therapy with a target INR of 2.0–3.0, as reported in the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468

 and the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial.

An observational study with 4,009 patients undergoing antithrombotic therapy in Japan showed that the incidence of major bleeding with single antiplatelet, multiple antiplatelet agents, warfarin, and warfarin plus antiplatelet agents was 1.2%/year, 2.0%/year, 2.1%/year, and 3.6%/year, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.3%/year, 0.6%/year, 0.6%/year, and 1.0%/year, respectively.
327
 We need to recognize that serious bleeding can occur at a certain frequency during antithrombotic therapy, and that the risk increases with the concomitant use of antithrombotic agents. We also need to know how to manage hemorrhagic complications (Figure 15, Table 43).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for the Management of Active Bleeding

In the case of mild bleeding, we should consider correct continuation of antithrombotic therapy rather than discontinuation without careful consideration. For moderate‐to‐severe bleeding, it is recommended to discontinue the antithrombotic agents, stop the bleeding, stabilize circulatory dynamics with appropriate drip infusion, and lower the blood pressure during intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (recommended class I).
487
, 
488
, 
489
 Administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K (recommended class I), fresh frozen plasma (FFP, recommended class I) and recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) are recommended for the purpose of suppressing bleeding tendency during warfarin therapy and acute severe bleeding, or for urgent surgery/procedures where serious bleeding is anticipated.
490
, 
491
, 
492
, 
493
, 
494
, 
495
, 
496

The administration of both PCC and vitamin K has the fastest and surest effect.
497
, 
498
, 
499
 Randomized controlled trials of PCC + vitamin K versus FFP + vitamin K performed in patients on warfarin treatment who had severe bleeding or suddenly needed invasive medical treatment showed a non‐inferiority of the hemostatic effect of PCC + vitamin K against FFP + vitamin K.
497
, 
498
 In addition, PCC had a shorter administration time, a shorter time to hemostasis, and a smaller volume than that of FFP. From the standpoint of pasteurization and nanofiltration, PCC is superior to FFP for safety.

The administration dose of the PCC is determined according to the INR value and body weight. PCC of 25 IU/kg (max. dose of 2,500 IU) for INR of ≥2.0 and <4.0, 35 IU/kg (max. dose of 3,500 IU) for INR of ≥4.0 and <6.0, or 50 IU/kg (max. dose of 5,000 IU) for INR ≥6.0 should be administered. Usage and dosage for patients with INR <2.0 have not been officially recognized.

However, a pharmacometric simulation model analysis showing the relationship of INR and coagulation factor activity using the PCC Phase III study data
497
, 
498
, 
499
 showed that PCC doses of 25 IU/kg, 20 IU/kg, and 15 IU/kg were needed at INRs 3.1, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively, to achieve both coagulant factor II and X activities of ≥50% in more than 80% of patients at 30 min after administration of PCC.
500
 Therefore, if urgent correction is required in a patient with INR <2.0, a dose of 20 IU/kg for INR >1.6 and 15 IU/kg for INR ≤ 1.6 might be considered.

In addition, studies in a small number of cases have been reported suggesting the usefulness of administering 15–25 IU/kg of PCC for INR <2.0.
501
, 
502
 For correction during heparin therapy, dilute protamine sulfate is slowly infused.
503

The incidence of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy is equivalent or less than that of warfarin. For bleeding, in addition to hemostasis treatment, we should consider discontinuation of DOACs according to the severity of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy and promotion of diuresis excretion by appropriate infusion. Administration of PCC (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) and that of recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) can be considered as measures against bleeding during DOAC therapy, but they have not been examined sufficiently. Dabigatran may be removed by hemodialysis because it has a low binding rate to proteins in the blood. For bleeding early after oral administration of each DOAC, gastric lavage or oral administration of activated charcoal may be considered to suppress the increase in blood concentration by suppressing absorption from the digestive tract.
504

Idarucizumab, a specific neutralizing antibody, is used during dabigatran therapy. To suppress the bleeding tendency during dabigatran therapy with acute severe bleeding or for urgent surgery/procedures in which significant bleeding is anticipated, idarucizumab is administered within 24 h after the last oral dose of dabigatran.
332
 Because a high blood concentration may be sustained in patients with renal dysfunction or oral administration of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors, we may consider administration of idarucizumab for up to 48 h in those patients. Regardless of the dose or time after oral administration, 5 g idarucizumab (two 2.5 g vials) is administered. The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is rapidly and completely neutralized within 1 min after the administration and the neutralizing effect is sustained for 24 h.

Dabigatran can be administered 24 h after the administration of idarucizumab, and other anticoagulants can be administered within 24 h. Neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran may induce a hypercoagulable state prior to the introduction of dabigatran, but idarucizumab itself has no effect on coagulation or fibrinolysis. Therefore, if cerebral infarction develops in a patient on dabigatran treatment, there is an option to administer intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt‐PA) after neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran by administration of idarucizumab.
505

If it is necessary to correct the effects of factor Xa inhibitors, administration of an antidote, Andexanet alfa (unapproved at January 2022) or ciraparantag (unapproved at January 2022) may be considered.
457
, 
506
 Andexanet alfa is a decoy protein of coagulation factor Xa, and the corrective effect can be sustained by intravenous infusion after a fixed amount of intravenous injection.
457
 The dose varies depending on the type of factor Xa inhibitor. In the USA, it was approved as an antidote for rivaroxaban and apixaban in May 2018. In Japan, it is under development as an antidote for all factor Xa inhibitors. Ciraparantag is a low molecular weight compound that has attracted attention because it is suggested to have a neutralizing effect on not only factor Xa inhibitors but also thrombin inhibitors and heparin, but its development has been delayed.
506

If resumption of anticoagulant therapy is indicated, considering the source of hemorrhage and the state of hemostasis after hemostatic treatment, surgery, or other invasive procedure, it should be resumed as soon as possible to prevent thromboembolism.

### Risk Assessment (Thromboembolic and Bleeding Risks)

Risk assessment for thromboembolism is important for the management of patients with AF in the clinical setting, especially when considering anticoagulation therapy (Table 29).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Risk Assessment of AF

*1Cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease), persistent and permanent AF, renal dysfunction, low body weight (≤50 kg), left atrial diameter (>45 mm). *2Older age (≥75 years), low body weight (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), antiplatelet use, and uncontrolled hypertension.

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CCr, creatinine clearance; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Valvular AF should be distinguished from non‐valvular AF because warfarin is the only oral anticoagulant (OAC) approved for valvular AF. The effectiveness or safety of DOACs for valvular AF has never been proven.
238
, 
239
 “Valvular” means rheumatic mitral valve diseases (predominantly mitral stenosis) and the postoperative state with mechanical prosthetic valves. So far, among artificial valves, bioprosthetic valves have been categorized as “valvular” in the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013).
2
 However, recent reports on the use of DOACs for patients with AF after bioprosthetic valve replacement have suggested that the efficacy of DOACs to prevent thromboembolism was comparable with that of warfarin;
240
, 
241
, 
242
 although the safety of DOACs for bleeding might have been superior to that of warfarin,
240
 the numbers of subjects were relatively small in those studies. According to this evidence, bioprosthetic valves were considered as “non‐valvular” in a joint consensus document from the heart rhythm associations of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America in 2017.
243
 The 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focuse update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline followed this standpoint.
244

In this guideline, the definition of “non‐valvular” is updated to include bioprosthetic valves. The postoperative state of mitral valve repair (mitral annulorrhaphy or annuloplasty) and non‐rheumatic mitral regurgitation are included as “non‐valvular”, similar to the latest guidelines.
2
 (Because the effect‐efficacy of DOACs was described as “the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF” in a statement of the virtues of medicine, the echocardiographic findings of valve stenosis and regurgitation have often misled physicians in an insured medical treatment.) Because DOACs have been approved for the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF, the definition of “non‐valvular” is important at the selection of DOAC or warfarin. Generally, there is no inconvenience to including all valvular diseases as “non‐valvular”, except mitral stenosis and mechanical prosthetic valves.

In patients with non‐valvular AF (NVAF), because the accumulation of risk factors for thromboembolism increases the incidence of cardiogenic ischemic stroke,
245
, 
246
 it is recommended to determine appropriate anticoagulation therapy based on the risk assessment for thromboembolism. Assessments using risk scores have the advantage of standardization of risks evaluated by each physician.

In the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013),
2
 the CHADS2 score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 30)
245
 This score assigns 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (maximum 6 points). The risks for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score are stratified as low, intermediate, and high for scores of 0, 1, and ≥2, respectively.

CHADS2 Score

Maximum score: 6.

Abbreviation: TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Gage BF, et al. 2001.245)

In the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
247
 the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 31).
248
 This score comprises age ≥75 years and a history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism for 2 points and the other components of the CHADS2 score, vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), age 65–74 years, and sex category (female sex) for 1 point (maximum 9 points). In the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study
249
 cited in the ESC guidelines,
244
 factors in addition to the CHADS2 score showed a significant risk for thromboembolism. Consequently, the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted again in the 2016 ESC guidelines developed in collaboration with EACTS.
21
 This score was also adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline
250
 in the USA and by the Asian Pacific Heart Rhythm Society.

CHA2DS2‐VASc Score

Maximum score: 9.

Abbreviation: TE, thromboembolism; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Lip GY, et al. 2010.
248
)

In contrast, the CHADS2 score
245
 was again adopted in this Japanese guideline as well as in the previous version of the guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 although opinions on which risk score is suitable for Japanese patients with NVAF differed among specialists. One principal reason is that the simple CHADS2 score should be propagated first, because the use of a risk score was not sufficiently widespread in the clinical setting when the latest guidelines were published (JCS 2013).
2
 Although the CHADS2 score has several problems and is imperfect, the risk score needs to be simple to encourage non‐specialists to continue active risk assessment.
251
 In addition, the factors added to the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) were not a significant risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database).
252
 Because a superior novel risk score of simplicity and predicability has not yet been established since the publication of the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 risk assessment for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score is the most suitable for Japanese patients for the moment. Other influential factors not included in the CHADS2 score can be thought of as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy as in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2

Components of the CHADS2 score
245
 were derived from patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy among the pooled data of 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) (n=3,432)
253
, 
254
, 
255
 and the first 2 trials in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) (n=2,012).
256
, 
257
, 
258
 Age, hypertension, prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA), and diabetes mellitus were detected from the AFI, whereas hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >160 mmHg), prior cerebral ischemia, recent heart failure, and women aged ≥75 years were detected as risk factors for ischemic stroke from SPAF III. These factors were amalgamated and used to determine the 5 factors in the current CHADS2 score.
245
 This clinical classification scheme was validated using data from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) consisting of 1,733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–95 years with NVAF who were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.
245
 The incidence rate of ischemic stroke per 100 patient‐years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 for each 1‐point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 for a score of 0, 2.8 for 1, 4.0 for 2, 5.9 for 3, 8.5 for 4, 12.5 for 5, and 18.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11A).
245
 Although these rates are often used as the gold standard for informed consent, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy in a pooled analysis of the 3 major AF registries
252
 were obviously lower than those in the original report by Gage et al
245
 and in other reports
259
 from foreign countries: 0.5 for a score of 0, 0.9 for 1, 1.5 for 2, 2.7 for 3, 6.1 for 4, 3.9 for 5, and 7.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11B).
252
 Therefore, the original incidence rates
245
 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current Japanese patients. The original rates should be interpreted cautiously because all subjects in the NRAF used for validation of the CHADS2 score were older (range, 65–95; mean, 81 years) and standard therapeutic drugs for hypertension and heart failure were different from those used today.

)

Although the CHADS2 score consists of 5 factors, only 3 (hypertension, age ≥75 years, and a history of stroke or TIA) were identified as significant risks for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database),
252
 and congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus were not (Table 32).

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF. The risk for thromboembolism is comparable between patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved EF (HFpEF).
231
 In phase III trials using DOACs,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 HF was defined as either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or more, or HF symptoms within previous 3–6 months.

Possible reasons why HF was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism include the difference in current standard therapeutic drugs for HF compared with the 1990s, HF being a stronger risk factor for all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths rather than for thromboembolism,
264
 and the severity or duration of HF not taken into consideration.
265
, 
266
 In a subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial,
265
 severe HF with NYHA class III or IV was a significant risk factor for thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.88). In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267
 Therefore, the definition of hypertension in the CHADS2 score includes a history of hypertension in addition to the criteria of hypertension in those days of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg. Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,
269
 and the ARISTOTLE trial.
270
 In contrast, in a subanalysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
271
 neither hypertension (including its history and/or under treatment) nor BP value at the time of enrollment was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, but the incidence of thromboembolism in the highest quartile of systolic BP (≥136 mmHg) at the time closest to the event was significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile (<114 mmHg) (odds ratio 2.88, 95% CI 1.75–4.74). A subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry
272
 also showed that event rates in patients with hypertension were comparable to those without hypertension, but the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with a baseline systolic BP ≥150 mmHg was significantly higher than in those with adequate BP control.

Given that patients with inadequate BP control have consistently indicated high event rates in all studies,
269
, 
270
, 
271
, 
272
, 
273
 including trials in which hypertension was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism,
271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271
, 
275
 The reason can be speculated as the control status of blood glucose levels or the recent progression of oral hypoglycemic agents not being reflected in these results, but the precise causes remain unknown. However, HRs were >1.0 in most studies.
249
, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

In the latest vision of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 cardiomyopathy, advanced age (65–74 years), and vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease) were listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy.

Advanced age (65–74 years) was a significant risk factor for stroke in the AFI
253
 and the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study.
249
 In the 2016 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
280
 patients aged ≥65 years are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy, regardless of other risk factors. It named the score as “CHADS65” due to attaching importance to age ≥65 years. However, it has not been identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in Japan, even though the HR was slightly high at 1.0–1.3.
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “vascular disease” including prior myocardial infarction,
253
 aortic plaque,
281
 and peripheral arterial disease
282
 was identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism and listed in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 these factors were not a significant risk for thromboembolism in Japanese patients.
252
, 
271
, 
275

In patients with “cardiomyopathy,” the coagulation system is often activated.
283
, 
284
 In some cohort studies of Japanese patients with NVAF, cardiomyopathy, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was reportedly an independent risk factor for stroke.
284
, 
285

Because being “female”
249
, 
253
 had proved not to be a solo risk factor in AF patients aged <65 years without other organic diseases,
247
, 
274
, 
286
 it was deleted in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2
 Subsequently, given that female sex was not detected as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in subanalyses of both the J‐RHYTHM Registry
287
 and the Fushimi AF Registry,
288
 it was determined not to describe this as a solo risk factor in this guideline. It seems reasonable that female sex is dealt with as a modifier of other risk factors independent of sex.
289
, 
290

“Thyrotoxicosis” is not considered as a risk factor for thromboembolism, as described in the previous version of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 because thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism has not been sufficiently validated as a solo risk factor for thromboembolism.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,
291
, 
292
 the risk for thromboembolism in patients with persistent or permanent AF is reportedly higher than that in those with paroxysmal AF in subanalyses of phase III trials using DOACs
293
, 
294
, 
295
, 
296
 and the Fushimi AF Registry.
297
 In addition, the risk of adverse events was transiently elevated during the progression period from paroxysmal to sustained AF.
298

Among the findings of echocardiography, LV systolic function (LV fractional shortening <25%),
255
, 
257
 left atrial (LA) dysfunction,
299
 and LA diameter (>45 mm) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),
275
 and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (so‐called smoke‐like or moyamoya echo) in the LA, LA appendage thrombus, and peak LA appendage flow velocity (<20 cm/s)
281
 on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been reported as risk factors for thromboembolism.

“Low body weight (BW) or low body mass index (BMI)” and “renal dysfunction” often lead to issues in patients with AF, especially in elderly patients. In the Fushimi AF Registry, BW ≤50 kg
300
 and creatinine clearance (CCr) <30 mL/min
301
 were significant risk factors for thromboembolism. In contrast, in the J‐RHYTHM Registry, BMI <18.5 kg/m2 302 and CCr <30 mL/min

 were stronger risk factors for all‐cause death than for thromboembolism. Factors not included in the CHADS2 score in subanalyses of both registries are shown in Table 33.

Risk Factors for Thromboembolism Not Included in the CHADS2 Score

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; BMI, body mass index; BW, body weight; CCr, creatinine clearance; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LAD, left atrial diameter; OR, odds ratio.

Accordingly to these AF registry studies in Japan, in the present guideline persistent or permanent AF, low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction, and LA diameter (>45 mm) are newly listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy (Figure 12), in addition to cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), and vascular disease.

Anticoagulation therapy in AF. *
1
Bioprosthetic values are included in non‐valvular AF. *2Regarding anticoagulation according to renal function, see “3.2.3 Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants” and Table 36. *3Regarding target INR 1.6–2.6 in non‐valvular AF, INR close to 2.0 is recommended as possible. INR 2.0–3.0 may be considered in high‐risk patients aged <70 years with a history of stroke or CHADS2 score ≥3. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The predictive ability of a risk score for events is generally evaluated using the c‐statistic (or c‐index).
304
 C‐statistics of the schemas in the AFI and SPAF, which were used for derivations of the CHADS2 score, were 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, that in the NRAF used for validation was 0.82, which was higher than each of the values of the AFI or SPAF.
245
 Novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed by adding other factors such as the CHA2DS2‐VASc score,
248
 the R2CHADS2 score
305
 by adding renal dysfunction, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history) stroke risk score
306
 by adding biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], high‐sensitivity troponin T), and so on. However, because the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7, it is difficult to determine whether predictive ability has improved compared with that of the CHADS2 score.
245
 A validation study of the J‐RHYTHM Registry
289
 also demonstrated that the c‐statistic of either the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (0.595) or the CHA2DS2‐VA score (0.624), when female sex was removed, was not higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.638).

Approximately half of patients with NVAF correspond to a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1,
274
, 
307
 for which the effectiveness of warfarin has not been proven. The prevalence of patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 was reportedly 15.6% in the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
307
 and 11.2% in the Fushimi AF Registry.
308
 In patients with cerebral infarction, those with a CHADS2 score of 0 before the onset of stroke comprised 7.3% and were not necessarily rare in the SAMURAI‐NVAF.
309
 The CHADS2 score is limited for distinguishing low‐risk patients, but the CHA2DS2‐VASc score is thought to be useful to detect an especially true low‐risk one who may not require anticoagulation therapy.
310
, 
311
 It can be proposed that anticoagulation therapy is not needed for patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 0, except for females, who showed no risk for thromboembolism in Japan.
287
, 
288
, 
289

In patients with NVAF, risk assessment for bleeding is important for the determination of anticoagulation therapy and to prevent bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy.

The HAS‐BLED score (Table 34)
312
 was adopted in the ESC guidelines in 2010 as a risk score for predicting bleeding.
282
 Comparing to the HEMORR2HAGES score published in 2006,
313
 this score is able to evaluate bleeding risks more simply and accurately in the clinical setting.
314
 The incidence rates of major bleeding per 100 patient‐years in each HAS‐BLED score were reportedly 1.13 for a score of 0, 1.02 for 1, 1.88 for 2, 3.74 for 3, 8.70 for 4, and 12.50 for 5,
312
 and a high risk was defined as a score ≥3. Because hypertension, prior stroke, and advanced age were mutual factors in the CHADS2 score,
245
 high‐risk patients for bleeding are also at high risk for thromboembolism.
315
 However, note that the definitions of risk factors in the HAS‐BLED score differ from those in the CHADS2 score. In the HAS‐BLED score, hypertension is defined as uncontrolled in patients with systolic BP >160 mmHg and advanced age is defined as >65 years. Labile international normalized ratio (INR) assumed that patients receive warfarin. Although novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed, such as the ATRIA hemorrhagic risk score,
316
 simplified by omitting INR, the ORBIT score,
317
 and the ABC bleeding risk score by adding biomarkers,
318
 the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7 and thus, the predictive ability has not markedly improved.

HAS‐BLED Score

Maximum score: 9.

*1Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg. *2Abnormal renal function is defined as chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or serum creatinine ≥200 μmol/L (2.26 mg/dL). Abnormal liver function is defined as chronic hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant hepatic derangement (e.g., bilirubin >2×upper limit of normal, in association with AST/ALT/ALP >3×upper limit normal). *3Bleeding refers to previous bleeding history and/or predisposition to bleeding (e.g., bleeding diathesis, anemia). *4Labile INR refers to unstable/high INR or poor time in therapeutic range (i.e., <60%). *5Drugs/alcohol use refers to concomitant use of drugs, such as antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or alcohol abuse.

Abbreviation: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio.

In actual clinical practice, especially during anticoagulation therapy, it is important to assess bleeding risks using the “major risk factors for bleeding” as listed below since the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 and to control those factors suitable for intervention among the “factors related to intracranial hemorrhage” also listed below.

According to the results from a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial,
319
 a post marketing surveillance of dabigatran,
320
 and some domestic AF registry studies,
321
, 
322
 older age (≥75 years), low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), and antiplatelet use are major risk factors for bleeding during anticoagulation therapy. In patients receiving dabigatran, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and concomitant use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors are also risk factors for major bleeding (HR ≥3).
320
 In the present guideline, “uncontrolled hypertension” has been newly added as a major risk factor, based on results from the ROCKET AF trial,
269
 ARISTOTLE trial,
270
 and subanalyses of the Japanese AF registry studies.
271
, 
272
 Physicians should watch for critical bleeding complications in these high‐risk patients regardless of the anticoagulant used.

In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, age, prior stroke or TIA, use of aspirin or warfarin, and not being Caucasian were identified as factors related to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
323
 To date, hypertension, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, East Asian ethnicity, hypocholesterolemia, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, advanced age, prior cerebral infarction, and cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been identified as risk factors related to the development of ICH. Hypertension, prior cerebral infarction, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, hyperglycemia, and antithrombotic therapy were reportedly predisposing factors for enlargement of the ICH.
324
, 
325
, 
326
 To prevent the incidence of ICH, the use of DOACs with a low risk for ICH, adequate control of BP and blood glucose levels, abstention from smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and avoiding antiplatelet use could be recommended.
238
, 
327

In actual clinical practice, it is crucial to assess the risks for both thromboembolism and bleeding in individual patients and to select treatments that lead to a net clinical benefit
329
 based on a consideration of the risks and benefits.

### Risk Assessment for Cardiogenic Thromboembolism

Risk assessment for thromboembolism is important for the management of patients with AF in the clinical setting, especially when considering anticoagulation therapy (Table 29).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Risk Assessment of AF

*1Cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease), persistent and permanent AF, renal dysfunction, low body weight (≤50 kg), left atrial diameter (>45 mm). *2Older age (≥75 years), low body weight (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), antiplatelet use, and uncontrolled hypertension.

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CCr, creatinine clearance; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Valvular AF should be distinguished from non‐valvular AF because warfarin is the only oral anticoagulant (OAC) approved for valvular AF. The effectiveness or safety of DOACs for valvular AF has never been proven.
238
, 
239
 “Valvular” means rheumatic mitral valve diseases (predominantly mitral stenosis) and the postoperative state with mechanical prosthetic valves. So far, among artificial valves, bioprosthetic valves have been categorized as “valvular” in the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013).
2
 However, recent reports on the use of DOACs for patients with AF after bioprosthetic valve replacement have suggested that the efficacy of DOACs to prevent thromboembolism was comparable with that of warfarin;
240
, 
241
, 
242
 although the safety of DOACs for bleeding might have been superior to that of warfarin,
240
 the numbers of subjects were relatively small in those studies. According to this evidence, bioprosthetic valves were considered as “non‐valvular” in a joint consensus document from the heart rhythm associations of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America in 2017.
243
 The 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focuse update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline followed this standpoint.
244

In this guideline, the definition of “non‐valvular” is updated to include bioprosthetic valves. The postoperative state of mitral valve repair (mitral annulorrhaphy or annuloplasty) and non‐rheumatic mitral regurgitation are included as “non‐valvular”, similar to the latest guidelines.
2
 (Because the effect‐efficacy of DOACs was described as “the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF” in a statement of the virtues of medicine, the echocardiographic findings of valve stenosis and regurgitation have often misled physicians in an insured medical treatment.) Because DOACs have been approved for the prophylaxis of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non‐valvular AF, the definition of “non‐valvular” is important at the selection of DOAC or warfarin. Generally, there is no inconvenience to including all valvular diseases as “non‐valvular”, except mitral stenosis and mechanical prosthetic valves.

In patients with non‐valvular AF (NVAF), because the accumulation of risk factors for thromboembolism increases the incidence of cardiogenic ischemic stroke,
245
, 
246
 it is recommended to determine appropriate anticoagulation therapy based on the risk assessment for thromboembolism. Assessments using risk scores have the advantage of standardization of risks evaluated by each physician.

In the Guidelines for Pharmacotherapy of Atrial Fibrillation (JCS 2013),
2
 the CHADS2 score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 30)
245
 This score assigns 1 point each for the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, and diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (maximum 6 points). The risks for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score are stratified as low, intermediate, and high for scores of 0, 1, and ≥2, respectively.

CHADS2 Score

Maximum score: 6.

Abbreviation: TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Gage BF, et al. 2001.245)

In the 2012 focused update of the ESC guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
247
 the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism (Table 31).
248
 This score comprises age ≥75 years and a history of stroke, TIA, or thromboembolism for 2 points and the other components of the CHADS2 score, vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), age 65–74 years, and sex category (female sex) for 1 point (maximum 9 points). In the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study
249
 cited in the ESC guidelines,
244
 factors in addition to the CHADS2 score showed a significant risk for thromboembolism. Consequently, the CHA2DS2‐VASc score was adopted again in the 2016 ESC guidelines developed in collaboration with EACTS.
21
 This score was also adopted as a risk assessment score for thromboembolism in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline
250
 in the USA and by the Asian Pacific Heart Rhythm Society.

CHA2DS2‐VASc Score

Maximum score: 9.

Abbreviation: TE, thromboembolism; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Lip GY, et al. 2010.
248
)

In contrast, the CHADS2 score
245
 was again adopted in this Japanese guideline as well as in the previous version of the guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 although opinions on which risk score is suitable for Japanese patients with NVAF differed among specialists. One principal reason is that the simple CHADS2 score should be propagated first, because the use of a risk score was not sufficiently widespread in the clinical setting when the latest guidelines were published (JCS 2013).
2
 Although the CHADS2 score has several problems and is imperfect, the risk score needs to be simple to encourage non‐specialists to continue active risk assessment.
251
 In addition, the factors added to the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (vascular disease, age 65–74 years, and female sex) were not a significant risk for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database).
252
 Because a superior novel risk score of simplicity and predicability has not yet been established since the publication of the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 risk assessment for thromboembolism based on the CHADS2 score is the most suitable for Japanese patients for the moment. Other influential factors not included in the CHADS2 score can be thought of as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy as in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2

Components of the CHADS2 score
245
 were derived from patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy among the pooled data of 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) (n=3,432)
253
, 
254
, 
255
 and the first 2 trials in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) (n=2,012).
256
, 
257
, 
258
 Age, hypertension, prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA), and diabetes mellitus were detected from the AFI, whereas hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >160 mmHg), prior cerebral ischemia, recent heart failure, and women aged ≥75 years were detected as risk factors for ischemic stroke from SPAF III. These factors were amalgamated and used to determine the 5 factors in the current CHADS2 score.
245
 This clinical classification scheme was validated using data from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) consisting of 1,733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–95 years with NVAF who were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.
245
 The incidence rate of ischemic stroke per 100 patient‐years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 for each 1‐point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 for a score of 0, 2.8 for 1, 4.0 for 2, 5.9 for 3, 8.5 for 4, 12.5 for 5, and 18.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11A).
245
 Although these rates are often used as the gold standard for informed consent, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy in a pooled analysis of the 3 major AF registries
252
 were obviously lower than those in the original report by Gage et al
245
 and in other reports
259
 from foreign countries: 0.5 for a score of 0, 0.9 for 1, 1.5 for 2, 2.7 for 3, 6.1 for 4, 3.9 for 5, and 7.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11B).
252
 Therefore, the original incidence rates
245
 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current Japanese patients. The original rates should be interpreted cautiously because all subjects in the NRAF used for validation of the CHADS2 score were older (range, 65–95; mean, 81 years) and standard therapeutic drugs for hypertension and heart failure were different from those used today.

Incidence rates of ischemic stroke for each CHADS2 score. (A) Incidence rates of ischemic stroke with the original CHADS2 score (Adapted from Gage BF et al, 2001

). (B) Incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy (pooled analysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database). (Adapted from Suzuki S et al, 2015
252
)

Although the CHADS2 score consists of 5 factors, only 3 (hypertension, age ≥75 years, and a history of stroke or TIA) were identified as significant risks for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database),
252
 and congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus were not (Table 32).

Hazard Ratios for Ischemic Stroke in Japanese Patients With AF

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

(Adapted from Suzuki S, et al. 2015.
249
)

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF. The risk for thromboembolism is comparable between patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved EF (HFpEF).
231
 In phase III trials using DOACs,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 HF was defined as either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or more, or HF symptoms within previous 3–6 months.

Possible reasons why HF was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism include the difference in current standard therapeutic drugs for HF compared with the 1990s, HF being a stronger risk factor for all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths rather than for thromboembolism,
264
 and the severity or duration of HF not taken into consideration.
265
, 
266
 In a subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial,
265
 severe HF with NYHA class III or IV was a significant risk factor for thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.88). In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267
 Therefore, the definition of hypertension in the CHADS2 score includes a history of hypertension in addition to the criteria of hypertension in those days of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg. Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,
269
 and the ARISTOTLE trial.
270
 In contrast, in a subanalysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
271
 neither hypertension (including its history and/or under treatment) nor BP value at the time of enrollment was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, but the incidence of thromboembolism in the highest quartile of systolic BP (≥136 mmHg) at the time closest to the event was significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile (<114 mmHg) (odds ratio 2.88, 95% CI 1.75–4.74). A subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry
272
 also showed that event rates in patients with hypertension were comparable to those without hypertension, but the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with a baseline systolic BP ≥150 mmHg was significantly higher than in those with adequate BP control.

Given that patients with inadequate BP control have consistently indicated high event rates in all studies,
269
, 
270
, 
271
, 
272
, 
273
 including trials in which hypertension was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism,
271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271
, 
275
 The reason can be speculated as the control status of blood glucose levels or the recent progression of oral hypoglycemic agents not being reflected in these results, but the precise causes remain unknown. However, HRs were >1.0 in most studies.
249
, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

In the latest vision of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 cardiomyopathy, advanced age (65–74 years), and vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease) were listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy.

Advanced age (65–74 years) was a significant risk factor for stroke in the AFI
253
 and the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study.
249
 In the 2016 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
280
 patients aged ≥65 years are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy, regardless of other risk factors. It named the score as “CHADS65” due to attaching importance to age ≥65 years. However, it has not been identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in Japan, even though the HR was slightly high at 1.0–1.3.
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “vascular disease” including prior myocardial infarction,
253
 aortic plaque,
281
 and peripheral arterial disease
282
 was identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism and listed in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 these factors were not a significant risk for thromboembolism in Japanese patients.
252
, 
271
, 
275

In patients with “cardiomyopathy,” the coagulation system is often activated.
283
, 
284
 In some cohort studies of Japanese patients with NVAF, cardiomyopathy, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was reportedly an independent risk factor for stroke.
284
, 
285

Because being “female”
249
, 
253
 had proved not to be a solo risk factor in AF patients aged <65 years without other organic diseases,
247
, 
274
, 
286
 it was deleted in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2
 Subsequently, given that female sex was not detected as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in subanalyses of both the J‐RHYTHM Registry
287
 and the Fushimi AF Registry,
288
 it was determined not to describe this as a solo risk factor in this guideline. It seems reasonable that female sex is dealt with as a modifier of other risk factors independent of sex.
289
, 
290

“Thyrotoxicosis” is not considered as a risk factor for thromboembolism, as described in the previous version of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 because thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism has not been sufficiently validated as a solo risk factor for thromboembolism.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,
291
, 
292
 the risk for thromboembolism in patients with persistent or permanent AF is reportedly higher than that in those with paroxysmal AF in subanalyses of phase III trials using DOACs
293
, 
294
, 
295
, 
296
 and the Fushimi AF Registry.
297
 In addition, the risk of adverse events was transiently elevated during the progression period from paroxysmal to sustained AF.
298

Among the findings of echocardiography, LV systolic function (LV fractional shortening <25%),
255
, 
257
 left atrial (LA) dysfunction,
299
 and LA diameter (>45 mm) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),
275
 and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (so‐called smoke‐like or moyamoya echo) in the LA, LA appendage thrombus, and peak LA appendage flow velocity (<20 cm/s)
281
 on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been reported as risk factors for thromboembolism.

“Low body weight (BW) or low body mass index (BMI)” and “renal dysfunction” often lead to issues in patients with AF, especially in elderly patients. In the Fushimi AF Registry, BW ≤50 kg
300
 and creatinine clearance (CCr) <30 mL/min
301
 were significant risk factors for thromboembolism. In contrast, in the J‐RHYTHM Registry, BMI <18.5 kg/m2 302 and CCr <30 mL/min
303
 were stronger risk factors for all‐cause death than for thromboembolism. Factors not included in the CHADS2 score in subanalyses of both registries are shown in Table 33.

Accordingly to these AF registry studies in Japan, in the present guideline persistent or permanent AF, low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction, and LA diameter (>45 mm) are newly listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy (Figure 12), in addition to cardiomyopathy, age (65–74 years), and vascular disease.

Bioprosthetic values are included in non‐valvular AF. *2Regarding anticoagulation according to renal function, see “3.2.3 Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants” and Table 36. *3Regarding target INR 1.6–2.6 in non‐valvular AF, INR close to 2.0 is recommended as possible. INR 2.0–3.0 may be considered in high‐risk patients aged <70 years with a history of stroke or CHADS2 score ≥3. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

The predictive ability of a risk score for events is generally evaluated using the c‐statistic (or c‐index).
304
 C‐statistics of the schemas in the AFI and SPAF, which were used for derivations of the CHADS2 score, were 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, that in the NRAF used for validation was 0.82, which was higher than each of the values of the AFI or SPAF.
245
 Novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed by adding other factors such as the CHA2DS2‐VASc score,
248
 the R2CHADS2 score
305
 by adding renal dysfunction, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history) stroke risk score
306
 by adding biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], high‐sensitivity troponin T), and so on. However, because the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7, it is difficult to determine whether predictive ability has improved compared with that of the CHADS2 score.
245
 A validation study of the J‐RHYTHM Registry
289
 also demonstrated that the c‐statistic of either the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (0.595) or the CHA2DS2‐VA score (0.624), when female sex was removed, was not higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.638).

Approximately half of patients with NVAF correspond to a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1,
274
, 
307
 for which the effectiveness of warfarin has not been proven. The prevalence of patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 was reportedly 15.6% in the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
307
 and 11.2% in the Fushimi AF Registry.
308
 In patients with cerebral infarction, those with a CHADS2 score of 0 before the onset of stroke comprised 7.3% and were not necessarily rare in the SAMURAI‐NVAF.
309
 The CHADS2 score is limited for distinguishing low‐risk patients, but the CHA2DS2‐VASc score is thought to be useful to detect an especially true low‐risk one who may not require anticoagulation therapy.
310
, 
311
 It can be proposed that anticoagulation therapy is not needed for patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 0, except for females, who showed no risk for thromboembolism in Japan.

### Incidence Rate of Thromboembolism in Each CHADS2
 Score

Components of the CHADS2 score
245
 were derived from patients not receiving anticoagulation therapy among the pooled data of 5 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) (n=3,432)
253
, 
254
, 
255
 and the first 2 trials in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) (n=2,012).
256
, 
257
, 
258
 Age, hypertension, prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA), and diabetes mellitus were detected from the AFI, whereas hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] >160 mmHg), prior cerebral ischemia, recent heart failure, and women aged ≥75 years were detected as risk factors for ischemic stroke from SPAF III. These factors were amalgamated and used to determine the 5 factors in the current CHADS2 score.
245
 This clinical classification scheme was validated using data from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (NRAF) consisting of 1,733 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65–95 years with NVAF who were not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.
245
 The incidence rate of ischemic stroke per 100 patient‐years without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 for each 1‐point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 for a score of 0, 2.8 for 1, 4.0 for 2, 5.9 for 3, 8.5 for 4, 12.5 for 5, and 18.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11A).
245
 Although these rates are often used as the gold standard for informed consent, the incidence rates of ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy in a pooled analysis of the 3 major AF registries
252
 were obviously lower than those in the original report by Gage et al
245
 and in other reports
259
 from foreign countries: 0.5 for a score of 0, 0.9 for 1, 1.5 for 2, 2.7 for 3, 6.1 for 4, 3.9 for 5, and 7.2 for 6, respectively (Figure 11B).
252
 Therefore, the original incidence rates
245
 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to current Japanese patients. The original rates should be interpreted cautiously because all subjects in the NRAF used for validation of the CHADS2 score were older (range, 65–95; mean, 81 years) and standard therapeutic drugs for hypertension and heart failure were different from those used today.

### Validity of Components of the CHADS2 Score

Although the CHADS2 score consists of 5 factors, only 3 (hypertension, age ≥75 years, and a history of stroke or TIA) were identified as significant risks for ischemic stroke in Japanese patients with NVAF not receiving anticoagulation therapy, according to a pooled analysis of the 3 major domestic AF registries (J‐RHYTHM Registry, Fushimi AF Registry, and Shinken Database),
252
 and congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus were not (Table 32).

)

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF. The risk for thromboembolism is comparable between patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved EF (HFpEF).
231
 In phase III trials using DOACs,
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 HF was defined as either left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or more, or HF symptoms within previous 3–6 months.

Possible reasons why HF was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism include the difference in current standard therapeutic drugs for HF compared with the 1990s, HF being a stronger risk factor for all‐cause and cardiovascular deaths rather than for thromboembolism,
264
 and the severity or duration of HF not taken into consideration.
265
, 
266
 In a subanalysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial,
265
 severe HF with NYHA class III or IV was a significant risk factor for thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–1.88). In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267
 Therefore, the definition of hypertension in the CHADS2 score includes a history of hypertension in addition to the criteria of hypertension in those days of systolic BP ≥160 mmHg. Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,
269
 and the ARISTOTLE trial.
270
 In contrast, in a subanalysis of the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
271
 neither hypertension (including its history and/or under treatment) nor BP value at the time of enrollment was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, but the incidence of thromboembolism in the highest quartile of systolic BP (≥136 mmHg) at the time closest to the event was significantly higher than that in the lowest quartile (<114 mmHg) (odds ratio 2.88, 95% CI 1.75–4.74). A subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry
272
 also showed that event rates in patients with hypertension were comparable to those without hypertension, but the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke in patients with a baseline systolic BP ≥150 mmHg was significantly higher than in those with adequate BP control.

Given that patients with inadequate BP control have consistently indicated high event rates in all studies,
269
, 
270
, 
271
, 
272
, 
273
 including trials in which hypertension was not identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism,
271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271
, 
275
 The reason can be speculated as the control status of blood glucose levels or the recent progression of oral hypoglycemic agents not being reflected in these results, but the precise causes remain unknown. However, HRs were >1.0 in most studies.
249
, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

### Congestive Heart Failure

“Congestive heart failure” is defined as recent exacerbation of heart failure (HF) within the preceding 100 days.
245
, 
256
 However, because the definition of exacerbation is vague in the clinical setting, it can be determined by symptoms, examination findings, or administration of medications for HF, regardless of the classification of HF.

In addition, the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism markedly increased in the 30 days after admission for HF (HR 12.0, 95% CI 4.59–31.98) in a subanalysis of the Fushimi AF Registry.
266

### Hypertension

In the Framingham study, hypertension was a risk factor for stroke even in patients having a history and adequate BP control under antihypertensive medications.
267

Because hypertension is currently defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg in the Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2019),
268
 it is defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg and/or a history (including under treatment) in this guideline, as stated previously. In subanalyses of hypertension in the phase III trials using DOACs, hypertension was a significant risk factor for stroke or systemic embolism in the ROCKET‐AF trial,

271
, 
273
 appropriate BP control may result in a reduced risk of thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

### Age (≥75 Years)

“Age ≥75 years” is indicated as an especially high risk for thromboembolism among factors even with the same CHADS2 score of 1.
249
, 
274
 In some Japanese registry studies, it was also shown that age ≥75 years was a strong risk factor for thromboembolism (HR 2.3–2.8).

275

### Diabetes Mellitus

Although “diabetes mellitus” has been identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism in other studies,
249
, 
253
 it has not been in Japan.
252
, 
271

, 
252
, 
253
, 
271
 Given that diabetes mellitus is not working to reduce events, it was kept as a component of the CHADS2 score in this guideline.

### History of Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack

“History of stroke or TIA” is defined as prior cerebral ischemia (either stroke or TIA) and patients with it are categorized in the secondary prevention of stroke. As this factor is indicated to facilitate a higher risk for thromboembolism than the other risk factors,
258
, 
276
, 
277
, 
278
, 
279
 both the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2‐VASc scores assign it 2 points.

Accordingly, of the components of the CHADS2 score, age ≥75 years and a history stroke or TIA should be considered most intensively as risk factors; additionally, appropriate control of BP and HF is also important to prevent thromboembolism in patients with NVAF.

### Factors Not Included in the CHADS2 Score

In the latest vision of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 cardiomyopathy, advanced age (65–74 years), and vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, aortic plaque, and peripheral arterial disease) were listed as “other risks” when considering anticoagulation therapy.

Advanced age (65–74 years) was a significant risk factor for stroke in the AFI
253
 and the Swedish Cohort Atrial Fibrillation study.
249
 In the 2016 Focused Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation,
280
 patients aged ≥65 years are recommended to receive anticoagulation therapy, regardless of other risk factors. It named the score as “CHADS65” due to attaching importance to age ≥65 years. However, it has not been identified as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in Japan, even though the HR was slightly high at 1.0–1.3.
252
, 
271
, 
275

Although “vascular disease” including prior myocardial infarction,
253
 aortic plaque,
281
 and peripheral arterial disease
282
 was identified as a risk factor for thromboembolism and listed in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 these factors were not a significant risk for thromboembolism in Japanese patients.
252
, 
271
, 
275

In patients with “cardiomyopathy,” the coagulation system is often activated.
283
, 
284
 In some cohort studies of Japanese patients with NVAF, cardiomyopathy, especially hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was reportedly an independent risk factor for stroke.
284
, 
285

Because being “female”
249
, 
253
 had proved not to be a solo risk factor in AF patients aged <65 years without other organic diseases,
247
, 
274
, 
286
 it was deleted in the latest guidelines (JCS 2013).
2
 Subsequently, given that female sex was not detected as a significant risk factor for thromboembolism in subanalyses of both the J‐RHYTHM Registry
287
 and the Fushimi AF Registry,
288
 it was determined not to describe this as a solo risk factor in this guideline. It seems reasonable that female sex is dealt with as a modifier of other risk factors independent of sex.
289
, 
290

“Thyrotoxicosis” is not considered as a risk factor for thromboembolism, as described in the previous version of the Japanese guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 because thyrotoxicosis or hyperthyroidism has not been sufficiently validated as a solo risk factor for thromboembolism.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,
291
, 
292
 the risk for thromboembolism in patients with persistent or permanent AF is reportedly higher than that in those with paroxysmal AF in subanalyses of phase III trials using DOACs
293
, 
294
, 
295
, 
296
 and the Fushimi AF Registry.
297
 In addition, the risk of adverse events was transiently elevated during the progression period from paroxysmal to sustained AF.
298

Among the findings of echocardiography, LV systolic function (LV fractional shortening <25%),
255
, 
257
 left atrial (LA) dysfunction,
299
 and LA diameter (>45 mm) on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE),
275
 and dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (so‐called smoke‐like or moyamoya echo) in the LA, LA appendage thrombus, and peak LA appendage flow velocity (<20 cm/s)
281
 on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been reported as risk factors for thromboembolism.

“Low body weight (BW) or low body mass index (BMI)” and “renal dysfunction” often lead to issues in patients with AF, especially in elderly patients. In the Fushimi AF Registry, BW ≤50 kg
300
 and creatinine clearance (CCr) <30 mL/min
301
 were significant risk factors for thromboembolism. In contrast, in the J‐RHYTHM Registry, BMI <18.5 kg/m2 302 and CCr <30 mL/min
303
 were stronger risk factors for all‐cause death than for thromboembolism. Factors not included in the CHADS2 score in subanalyses of both registries are shown in Table 33.

Although the incidence rate of ischemic stroke appears to be comparable between patients with paroxysmal and persistent/permanent AF,

Bioprosthetic values are included in non‐valvular AF. *2Regarding anticoagulation according to renal function, see “3.2.3 Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants” and Table 36. *3Regarding target INR 1.6–2.6 in non‐valvular AF, INR close to 2.0 is recommended as possible. INR 2.0–3.0 may be considered in high‐risk patients aged <70 years with a history of stroke or CHADS2 score ≥3. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TIA, transient ischemic attack.

### Predictive Ability of CHADS2
 Score for Events

The predictive ability of a risk score for events is generally evaluated using the c‐statistic (or c‐index).
304
 C‐statistics of the schemas in the AFI and SPAF, which were used for derivations of the CHADS2 score, were 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. In contrast, that in the NRAF used for validation was 0.82, which was higher than each of the values of the AFI or SPAF.
245
 Novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed by adding other factors such as the CHA2DS2‐VASc score,
248
 the R2CHADS2 score
305
 by adding renal dysfunction, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history) stroke risk score
306
 by adding biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], high‐sensitivity troponin T), and so on. However, because the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7, it is difficult to determine whether predictive ability has improved compared with that of the CHADS2 score.
245
 A validation study of the J‐RHYTHM Registry
289
 also demonstrated that the c‐statistic of either the CHA2DS2‐VASc score (0.595) or the CHA2DS2‐VA score (0.624), when female sex was removed, was not higher than that of the CHADS2 score (0.638).

### Detectability of CHADS2
 Score for True Low‐Risk Patients

Approximately half of patients with NVAF correspond to a CHADS2 score of 0 or 1,
274
, 
307
 for which the effectiveness of warfarin has not been proven. The prevalence of patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 was reportedly 15.6% in the J‐RHYTHM Registry,
307
 and 11.2% in the Fushimi AF Registry.
308
 In patients with cerebral infarction, those with a CHADS2 score of 0 before the onset of stroke comprised 7.3% and were not necessarily rare in the SAMURAI‐NVAF.
309
 The CHADS2 score is limited for distinguishing low‐risk patients, but the CHA2DS2‐VASc score is thought to be useful to detect an especially true low‐risk one who may not require anticoagulation therapy.
310
, 
311
 It can be proposed that anticoagulation therapy is not needed for patients with a CHA2DS2‐VASc score of 0, except for females, who showed no risk for thromboembolism in Japan.

### Risk Assessment for Bleeding

In patients with NVAF, risk assessment for bleeding is important for the determination of anticoagulation therapy and to prevent bleeding complications during anticoagulation therapy.

The HAS‐BLED score (Table 34)
312
 was adopted in the ESC guidelines in 2010 as a risk score for predicting bleeding.
282
 Comparing to the HEMORR2HAGES score published in 2006,
313
 this score is able to evaluate bleeding risks more simply and accurately in the clinical setting.
314
 The incidence rates of major bleeding per 100 patient‐years in each HAS‐BLED score were reportedly 1.13 for a score of 0, 1.02 for 1, 1.88 for 2, 3.74 for 3, 8.70 for 4, and 12.50 for 5,
312
 and a high risk was defined as a score ≥3. Because hypertension, prior stroke, and advanced age were mutual factors in the CHADS2 score,
245
 high‐risk patients for bleeding are also at high risk for thromboembolism.
315
 However, note that the definitions of risk factors in the HAS‐BLED score differ from those in the CHADS2 score. In the HAS‐BLED score, hypertension is defined as uncontrolled in patients with systolic BP >160 mmHg and advanced age is defined as >65 years. Labile international normalized ratio (INR) assumed that patients receive warfarin. Although novel risk scores with higher predictive ability have been developed, such as the ATRIA hemorrhagic risk score,
316
 simplified by omitting INR, the ORBIT score,
317
 and the ABC bleeding risk score by adding biomarkers,
318
 the c‐statistics of these scores were 0.6–0.7 and thus, the predictive ability has not markedly improved.

HAS‐BLED Score

Maximum score: 9.

*1Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg. *2Abnormal renal function is defined as chronic dialysis or renal transplantation or serum creatinine ≥200 μmol/L (2.26 mg/dL). Abnormal liver function is defined as chronic hepatic disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant hepatic derangement (e.g., bilirubin >2×upper limit of normal, in association with AST/ALT/ALP >3×upper limit normal). *3Bleeding refers to previous bleeding history and/or predisposition to bleeding (e.g., bleeding diathesis, anemia). *4Labile INR refers to unstable/high INR or poor time in therapeutic range (i.e., <60%). *5Drugs/alcohol use refers to concomitant use of drugs, such as antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, or alcohol abuse.

Abbreviation: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; INR, international normalized ratio.

In actual clinical practice, especially during anticoagulation therapy, it is important to assess bleeding risks using the “major risk factors for bleeding” as listed below since the latest guidelines (JCS 2013),
2
 and to control those factors suitable for intervention among the “factors related to intracranial hemorrhage” also listed below.

According to the results from a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial,

 a post marketing surveillance of dabigatran,

 and some domestic AF registry studies,
321
, 
322
 older age (≥75 years), low BW (≤50 kg), renal dysfunction (CCr ≤50 mL/min), and antiplatelet use are major risk factors for bleeding during anticoagulation therapy. In patients receiving dabigatran, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and concomitant use of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors are also risk factors for major bleeding (HR ≥3).
320
 In the present guideline, “uncontrolled hypertension” has been newly added as a major risk factor, based on results from the ROCKET AF trial,

 Physicians should watch for critical bleeding complications in these high‐risk patients regardless of the anticoagulant used.

In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, age, prior stroke or TIA, use of aspirin or warfarin, and not being Caucasian were identified as factors related to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
323
 To date, hypertension, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, East Asian ethnicity, hypocholesterolemia, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, advanced age, prior cerebral infarction, and cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been identified as risk factors related to the development of ICH. Hypertension, prior cerebral infarction, hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, hyperglycemia, and antithrombotic therapy were reportedly predisposing factors for enlargement of the ICH.
324

325
,

 To prevent the incidence of ICH, the use of DOACs with a low risk for ICH, adequate control of BP and blood glucose levels, abstention from smoking and excessive alcohol intake, and avoiding antiplatelet use could be recommended.

### Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin

A direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran,
260
 and factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban,
261
 apixaban,
262
 and edoxaban
263
 have been approved in Japan as oral anticoagulants with indications for prevention of ischemic stroke in AF, and are now available in daily clinical practice. These were first named as “new oral anticoagulants”, but have been called with several different names in contrast with VKA.
22
 Here, we call them DOACs.
330

DOACs have several advantages compared with warfarin, including fixed dosing, no need for regular blood sampling for dose adjustment, low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), less frequency of interactions with food and other drugs, rapid onset of action, and relatively short half‐life, all of which accordingly lead to no need or shortening of heparin replacement in the perioperative period. On the other hand, DOACs have several disadvantages, including a contraindication in severe renal dysfunction, rapid offset of action if a dose is missed, due to their short half‐life, no adequate measures for severe bleeding under anticoagulation therapy, and increased cost burden by patients. Among these, measures for severe bleeding have been partially established due to the recent development of antidotes for DOACs

 (see Section 3.6).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Anticoagulation for AF

*It has been reported that the threshold TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC).
359
 However, the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

Selection of DOACs for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation According to Renal Function

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; HD, hemodialysis.

When oral anticoagulation is started in a patient with AF who is indicated for a DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) among patients with normal renal function to mild renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [CCr] ≥30 mL/min), a DOAC is recommended as the first choice in preference to a VKA,
21
 because of the convenience of drug prescription, stability of drug effects, low frequency of interactions with foods and other drugs, and the low incidence of ICH. The efficaciousness and safety of DOACs have been reported to be equal or superior to warfarin in randomized clinical trials with both Asian (including Japanese) and non‐Asian subjects or in observational studies with Japanese.
346
, 
348
, 
349
, 
360
, 
361
, 
362

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 Meanwhile, small‐sized studies of DOAC usage in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have accumulated.
240
, 
241
, 
242
 However, during the 3 months after valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended, even in patients with sinus rhythm,
363
 and studies of AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have excluded this time period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

DOACs are contraindicated for patients with severe renal dysfunction (CCr <30 mL/min for dabigatran, and CCr <15 mL/min for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban)
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 (Table 37). Therefore, in AF patients with CCr <15 mL/min, warfarin is the only anticoagulant that can be selected for prevention of ischemic stroke. However, warfarin has a relative contraindication for patients with severe renal impairment on the package insert.
364
 The bleeding risk with warfarin usage in AF patients with severe renal impairment is extremely high, which may offset the merit of preventing ischemic stroke.
365

Dosage and Administration of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation

•CCr <50 mL/min•P‐glycoprotein inhibitors

•Age ≥70 years•History of gastrointestinal bleeding (for dabigatran, dose reduction is considered, but not required)

2 of the following:

•Serum Cr ≥1.5 mg/dL

•Age ≥80 years•Body weight ≤60 kg

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance.

When anticoagulation is considered for patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), the indication should be carefully considered. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy recommends that administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication because it increases not only bleeding events but also thromboembolic events.
366
 The present guidelines also recommend that the administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication. However, in daily clinical practice, warfarin is widely used in the perioperative period of catheter ablation, in patients with mechanical valves, or in patients who need secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the present guidelines recommend that the administration of warfarin be considered for such cases, even for patients on maintenance HD.

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin but not DOACs is indicated.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 In the present guidelines, AF with a history of valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is included as NVAF, which is indicated for DOAC usage. However, during the 3 months after a valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended even in patients with sinus rhythm
363
 and, meanwhile, studies evaluating the efficaciousness and safety of DOACs in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves
240
, 
241
, 
242
 excluded this period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

The differences in the pharmacological profiles of the DOACs are shown in Table 37.
367
 Several reviews have proposed flow charts for selection of DOACs based on their pharmacokinetic profiles, including metabolic pathways (renal excretion, hepatic excretion, and intestinal excretion) and number of doses, and the results of the subanalyses of phase III studies divided by the various patient backgrounds.
367
, 
368
, 
369
, 
370
 Of note, a review
367
 described Asian subanalyses including Japanese or a clinical trial with Japanese patients.
346
, 
348
, 
349
 However, although such flow charts may be useful for daily clinical practice, they cannot be regarded as absolute methods of choice because there have been no clinical trials that have directly compared among the DOACs.

It is essential to use DOACs with the dose and administration indicated in the package inserts (Tables 7 and 37), which have been determined through multiple clinical trials considering the characteristic pharmacokinetics for each DOAC. Moreover, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for stroke prevention by DOACs with on‐label dosing that are equal or superior to those of warfarin.
337

In daily clinical practice in Japan, there are more AF patients who are applicable for the dose reduction criteria of DOACs compared with Western countries due to high age and low body weight. Therefore, it is an issue in Japan whether the appropriateness of on‐label dosing may not be sufficiently validated in AF patients who are either older age or have mild to severe renal dysfunction; in such patients, evidence that verifies the appropriateness of on‐label dosing needs to accumulate. In the J‐ELD AF registry,
371
 which registered ∼3,000 Japanese elderly AF patients (≥75 years) under treatment with on‐label dosing of apixaban demonstrated similar efficiency and safety between the standard dose (n=1,284) and the reduced dose (n=1,747).

During warfarin administration, the intensity of anticoagulation effect is measured by the prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio (PT‐INR) and according to the PT‐INR, the dose of warfarin should be adjusted. In the JCS guidelines updated in 2013,
2
 the target range of PT‐INR was recommended as 1.6–2.6 for elderly patients (age ≥70 years)
353
 and 2.0–3.0 for younger patients (age <70 years). However, several reports from multicenter cohorts in Japan have demonstrated that clinicians targeted the PT‐INR range of 1.6–2.6, even in younger patients, presumably due to a fear of bleeding events.
307
, 
372

In the nationwide multicenter cohort of the J‐RHYTHM Registry, optimal PT‐INR under warfarin therapy was investigated using ∼8,000 AF patients. In that analysis, PT‐INR 1.6–2.6 was determined as the range in which both the risk of thromboembolism and major bleeding became minimal, regardless of elderly or younger patients.
350
, 
351
, 
352

Meanwhile, in studies of Japanese AF patients with acute ischemic stroke, the severity and prognosis after ischemic stroke according to PT‐INR at the time of the occurrence of ischemic stroke were evaluated.
354
, 
355
 In those studies, various measurements differed according to the PT‐INR, including the size of the infarction and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at the time of occurrence, and the severity of neural dysfunction or the prognosis of systemic function after ischemic stroke. In patients with PT‐INR 1.6–2.0, the measurements were similar to those with PT‐INR <1.6. Meanwhile, in patients with PT‐INR ≥2.0, the infarct size was small and the functional prognosis was relatively good.

Based on this evidence, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients without a history of ischemic stroke and having low thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≤2 points), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients. For this target range, the attending physician should aim to attain the middle (PT‐INR 2.0), but not the lower (1.6 or 1.7) value.

Meanwhile, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients with a history of ischemic stroke or having high thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≥3 points, or cancer patients), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years). Even in elderly patients, INR should be kept ≥2.0 as much as possible unless it threatens the safety for bleeding events.

As such, the present guidelines separate the optimal target range of warfarin therapy into primary prevention and secondary prevention: (i) in the former, the target range is 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients, and (ii) in the latter, the target range is 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years), which follows the target range in the previous guidelines.

The time in therapeutic range (TTR) is the measurement that calculates the percentage of time in which the PT‐INR under warfarin treatment is controlled within the target range.
374
 The TTR should be kept as high as possible. Although it has been reported that the threshold of TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC),
359
 the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and the thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

In the SAMURAI‐AF registry, which registered AF patients with a history of ischemic stroke, patients with optimal PT‐INR at the time of occurrence of ischemic stroke had a double risk of recurrence.
376
 In such cases, the patients may have a potential thrombophilia such as malignancy or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

DOACs have emerged as oral anticoagulants that do not need regular monitoring. Actually, in phase III trials, DOACs without regular monitoring showed similar efficacy and safety compared with warfarin with regular monitoring.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 However, it is recommended to measure the anticoagulation intensity of DOACs in high‐risk patients such as elderly patients, patients with renal dysfunction, and in patients who have experienced thromboembolism or bleeding events. However, it has not been well established how to interpret or how to respond to the results of the anticoagulation tests measured in daily clinical practice. Therefore, difficult cases should be referred to experts who have extensive experience with the prescription of DOACs (Table 38, 
330
, 
377
, 
378
, 
379
, 
380
).

Average Plasma Concentration and Response of Coagulation Tests for DOACs

Abbreviation: AF, atrial fibrillation; APTT, activated partial thrombplastin time; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; PT, prothrombin time.

)

Each DOAC has its own criteria of contraindication determined by renal function (Tables 36 and 37). Moreover, to determine the dose of DOACs, measurement of renal function is mandatory. In consideration of the pathogenesis or patient characteristics that may potentially decrease the coagulation activity (e.g., hemophilia,
356
 blood type O,
357
 etc.), a coagulation test before starting DOACs is encouraged. In hemophilia, the judgement for starting DOACs is based on the level of coagulation activity.
356

The bleeding complications after starting DOACs are concentrated in the first 3 months, but especially in the first month. Therefore, for early detection of bleeding, it is useful to check the temporal change in hemoglobin in elderly patients or patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also recommended to check changes in renal or liver function.

The 90% intervals of the distribution of the plasma concentration of DOACs at peak and trough in AF patients are shown in Table 38.
330
, 
377
, 
378
, 
379
, 
380
 The 90% intervals are known as the “on therapy range”,
381
, 
382
 which can indicate the optimal range of the plasma concentration of DOACs used in daily clinical practice. When the plasma concentration of the DOAC exceeds the 90% intervals, the bleeding risk may significantly increase.
383
, 
384
 Therefore, a coagulation test to measure the intensity of anticoagulation in the early phase after starting a DOAC is recommended. For this purpose, the hemoclot thrombin inhibitory assay (HTI) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are used for direct thrombin inhibitors, whereas the anti‐Xa assay (AXA) and prothrombin time (PT) are used for factor Xa inhibitors. However, measurement of PT for factor Xa inhibitors cannot be fully encouraged due to the wide variation in response according to the reagents used and the targeted factor Xa inhibitor.

When the prescription of DOACs continues for more than a few years, renal function gradually decreases over time.
385
 Therefore, measurement of renal function at least once per year is recommended.
330
, 
358
 Moreover, as most DOACs have hepatic metabolism, liver function should also be measured. For early detection of subclinical gastrointestinal bleeding, measurement of hemoglobin is also recommended. In elderly patients (≥75 years), blood testing at least once per 6 months is recommended. Moreover, in patients with CCr <60 mL/min, blood test once per X months (X=CCr/10) is recommended.

DOACs have several advantages compared with warfarin, including fixed dosing, no need for regular blood sampling for dose adjustment, low incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), less frequency of interactions with food and other drugs, rapid onset of action, and relatively short half‐life, all of which accordingly lead to no need or shortening of heparin replacement in the perioperative period. On the other hand, DOACs have several disadvantages, including a contraindication in severe renal dysfunction, rapid offset of action if a dose is missed, due to their short half‐life, no adequate measures for severe bleeding under anticoagulation therapy, and increased cost burden by patients. Among these, measures for severe bleeding have been partially established due to the recent development of antidotes for DOACs

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Anticoagulation for AF

*It has been reported that the threshold TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC).
359
 However, the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

Selection of DOACs for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation According to Renal Function

Abbreviation: CCr, creatinine clearance; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; HD, hemodialysis.

When oral anticoagulation is started in a patient with AF who is indicated for a DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) among patients with normal renal function to mild renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance [CCr] ≥30 mL/min), a DOAC is recommended as the first choice in preference to a VKA,
21
 because of the convenience of drug prescription, stability of drug effects, low frequency of interactions with foods and other drugs, and the low incidence of ICH. The efficaciousness and safety of DOACs have been reported to be equal or superior to warfarin in randomized clinical trials with both Asian (including Japanese) and non‐Asian subjects or in observational studies with Japanese.

 Meanwhile, small‐sized studies of DOAC usage in AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have accumulated.

 However, during the 3 months after valvular replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended, even in patients with sinus rhythm,
363
 and studies of AF patients with bioprosthetic valves have excluded this time period. Therefore, the current recommendations of anticoagulation for AF patients with bioprosthetic valves are (i) using warfarin for the 3 months after the valvular replacement and (ii) thereafter, can switch to a DOAC.

DOACs are contraindicated for patients with severe renal dysfunction (CCr <30 mL/min for dabigatran, and CCr <15 mL/min for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban)
260
,

 (Table 37). Therefore, in AF patients with CCr <15 mL/min, warfarin is the only anticoagulant that can be selected for prevention of ischemic stroke. However, warfarin has a relative contraindication for patients with severe renal impairment on the package insert.
364
 The bleeding risk with warfarin usage in AF patients with severe renal impairment is extremely high, which may offset the merit of preventing ischemic stroke.

Dosage and Administration of Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Non‐Valvular Atrial Fibrillation

When anticoagulation is considered for patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), the indication should be carefully considered. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy recommends that administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication because it increases not only bleeding events but also thromboembolic events.
366
 The present guidelines also recommend that the administration of warfarin for patients on maintenance HD is a relative contraindication. However, in daily clinical practice, warfarin is widely used in the perioperative period of catheter ablation, in patients with mechanical valves, or in patients who need secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the present guidelines recommend that the administration of warfarin be considered for such cases, even for patients on maintenance HD.

For AF patients with a history of valvular replacement (mechanical valve) or with a diagnosis of mitral stenosis (mostly rheumatic), namely valvular AF, only warfarin but not DOACs is indicated.

### Selection of Direct Oral Anticoagulants

The differences in the pharmacological profiles of the DOACs are shown in Table 37.
367
 Several reviews have proposed flow charts for selection of DOACs based on their pharmacokinetic profiles, including metabolic pathways (renal excretion, hepatic excretion, and intestinal excretion) and number of doses, and the results of the subanalyses of phase III studies divided by the various patient backgrounds.
367
, 
368
, 
369
, 
370
 Of note, a review
367
 described Asian subanalyses including Japanese or a clinical trial with Japanese patients.
346
, 
348
, 
349
 However, although such flow charts may be useful for daily clinical practice, they cannot be regarded as absolute methods of choice because there have been no clinical trials that have directly compared among the DOACs.

It is essential to use DOACs with the dose and administration indicated in the package inserts (Tables 7 and 37), which have been determined through multiple clinical trials considering the characteristic pharmacokinetics for each DOAC. Moreover, phase III clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for stroke prevention by DOACs with on‐label dosing that are equal or superior to those of warfarin.
337

In daily clinical practice in Japan, there are more AF patients who are applicable for the dose reduction criteria of DOACs compared with Western countries due to high age and low body weight. Therefore, it is an issue in Japan whether the appropriateness of on‐label dosing may not be sufficiently validated in AF patients who are either older age or have mild to severe renal dysfunction; in such patients, evidence that verifies the appropriateness of on‐label dosing needs to accumulate. In the J‐ELD AF registry,
371
 which registered ∼3,000 Japanese elderly AF patients (≥75 years) under treatment with on‐label dosing of apixaban demonstrated similar efficiency and safety between the standard dose (n=1,284) and the reduced dose (n=1,747).

### Coagulation Test Under Prescription of Warfarin

During warfarin administration, the intensity of anticoagulation effect is measured by the prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio (PT‐INR) and according to the PT‐INR, the dose of warfarin should be adjusted. In the JCS guidelines updated in 2013,
2
 the target range of PT‐INR was recommended as 1.6–2.6 for elderly patients (age ≥70 years)
353
 and 2.0–3.0 for younger patients (age <70 years). However, several reports from multicenter cohorts in Japan have demonstrated that clinicians targeted the PT‐INR range of 1.6–2.6, even in younger patients, presumably due to a fear of bleeding events.
307
, 
372

In the nationwide multicenter cohort of the J‐RHYTHM Registry, optimal PT‐INR under warfarin therapy was investigated using ∼8,000 AF patients. In that analysis, PT‐INR 1.6–2.6 was determined as the range in which both the risk of thromboembolism and major bleeding became minimal, regardless of elderly or younger patients.
350
, 
351
, 
352

Meanwhile, in studies of Japanese AF patients with acute ischemic stroke, the severity and prognosis after ischemic stroke according to PT‐INR at the time of the occurrence of ischemic stroke were evaluated.
354
, 
355
 In those studies, various measurements differed according to the PT‐INR, including the size of the infarction and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at the time of occurrence, and the severity of neural dysfunction or the prognosis of systemic function after ischemic stroke. In patients with PT‐INR 1.6–2.0, the measurements were similar to those with PT‐INR <1.6. Meanwhile, in patients with PT‐INR ≥2.0, the infarct size was small and the functional prognosis was relatively good.

Based on this evidence, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients without a history of ischemic stroke and having low thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≤2 points), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients. For this target range, the attending physician should aim to attain the middle (PT‐INR 2.0), but not the lower (1.6 or 1.7) value.

Meanwhile, for prevention of ischemic stroke in NVAF patients with a history of ischemic stroke or having high thromboembolic risks (i.e., CHADS2 score ≥3 points, or cancer patients), the optimal range of PT‐INR under warfarin therapy would be 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years). Even in elderly patients, INR should be kept ≥2.0 as much as possible unless it threatens the safety for bleeding events.

As such, the present guidelines separate the optimal target range of warfarin therapy into primary prevention and secondary prevention: (i) in the former, the target range is 1.6–2.6 irrespective of elderly or younger patients, and (ii) in the latter, the target range is 1.6–2.6 in elderly patients (age ≥70 years) and 2.0–3.0 in younger patients (age <70 years), which follows the target range in the previous guidelines.

The time in therapeutic range (TTR) is the measurement that calculates the percentage of time in which the PT‐INR under warfarin treatment is controlled within the target range.
374
 The TTR should be kept as high as possible. Although it has been reported that the threshold of TTR under warfarin therapy that reduces mortality compared with no anticoagulation is ≥60% and that yielding better cost‐effective medical care compared with DOACs was ≥65–90% (variation according to the referenced DOAC),
359
 the TTR should always be targeted at 100% and the thresholds above should be regarded as the least acceptable levels.

In the SAMURAI‐AF registry, which registered AF patients with a history of ischemic stroke, patients with optimal PT‐INR at the time of occurrence of ischemic stroke had a double risk of recurrence.
376
 In such cases, the patients may have a potential thrombophilia such as malignancy or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

### Coagulation Test Under Prescription of Direct Oral Anticoagulants

DOACs have emerged as oral anticoagulants that do not need regular monitoring. Actually, in phase III trials, DOACs without regular monitoring showed similar efficacy and safety compared with warfarin with regular monitoring.
260
, 
261
, 
262
, 
263
 However, it is recommended to measure the anticoagulation intensity of DOACs in high‐risk patients such as elderly patients, patients with renal dysfunction, and in patients who have experienced thromboembolism or bleeding events. However, it has not been well established how to interpret or how to respond to the results of the anticoagulation tests measured in daily clinical practice. Therefore, difficult cases should be referred to experts who have extensive experience with the prescription of DOACs (Table 38, 
330
, 
377
, 
378
, 
379
, 
380
).

)

Each DOAC has its own criteria of contraindication determined by renal function (Tables 36 and 37). Moreover, to determine the dose of DOACs, measurement of renal function is mandatory. In consideration of the pathogenesis or patient characteristics that may potentially decrease the coagulation activity (e.g., hemophilia,
356
 blood type O,
357
 etc.), a coagulation test before starting DOACs is encouraged. In hemophilia, the judgement for starting DOACs is based on the level of coagulation activity.
356

The bleeding complications after starting DOACs are concentrated in the first 3 months, but especially in the first month. Therefore, for early detection of bleeding, it is useful to check the temporal change in hemoglobin in elderly patients or patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also recommended to check changes in renal or liver function.

The 90% intervals of the distribution of the plasma concentration of DOACs at peak and trough in AF patients are shown in Table 38.
330
, 
377
, 
378
, 
379
, 
380
 The 90% intervals are known as the “on therapy range”,
381
, 
382
 which can indicate the optimal range of the plasma concentration of DOACs used in daily clinical practice. When the plasma concentration of the DOAC exceeds the 90% intervals, the bleeding risk may significantly increase.
383
, 
384
 Therefore, a coagulation test to measure the intensity of anticoagulation in the early phase after starting a DOAC is recommended. For this purpose, the hemoclot thrombin inhibitory assay (HTI) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are used for direct thrombin inhibitors, whereas the anti‐Xa assay (AXA) and prothrombin time (PT) are used for factor Xa inhibitors. However, measurement of PT for factor Xa inhibitors cannot be fully encouraged due to the wide variation in response according to the reagents used and the targeted factor Xa inhibitor.

When the prescription of DOACs continues for more than a few years, renal function gradually decreases over time.
385
 Therefore, measurement of renal function at least once per year is recommended.
330
, 
358
 Moreover, as most DOACs have hepatic metabolism, liver function should also be measured. For early detection of subclinical gastrointestinal bleeding, measurement of hemoglobin is also recommended. In elderly patients (≥75 years), blood testing at least once per 6 months is recommended. Moreover, in patients with CCr <60 mL/min, blood test once per X months (X=CCr/10) is recommended.

### Blood Tests During Long‐Term Prescription of Direct Oral Anticoagulants

When the prescription of DOACs continues for more than a few years, renal function gradually decreases over time.
385
 Therefore, measurement of renal function at least once per year is recommended.
330
, 
358
 Moreover, as most DOACs have hepatic metabolism, liver function should also be measured. For early detection of subclinical gastrointestinal bleeding, measurement of hemoglobin is also recommended. In elderly patients (≥75 years), blood testing at least once per 6 months is recommended. Moreover, in patients with CCr <60 mL/min, blood test once per X months (X=CCr/10) is recommended.
330

### Prevention of Thromboembolism for Cardioversion

Two case–control studies reported that the risk of thromboembolic complication for cardioversion of AF without oral anticoagulation was 1–5%.
386
, 
387
 The risk is reduced by warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion.
388
, 
389
, 
390
 This anticoagulant regimen is applied for patients with AF ≥48 h duration or when the duration of AF is unknown. The duration of warfarin therapy is within the target range of PT‐INR; that is, we need more than 3 weeks before cardioversion if we start warfarin in naïve patients. The evidence of the safety of cardioversion of AF without anticoagulation in patients with AF duration <48 h is limited. Left atrial thrombus and thromboembolism can be induced by short‐term AF, but the necessity of anticoagulation is not determined.

In addition, post‐hoc analyses of a subset of patients undergoing cardioversion in phase 3 trials of approved DOACs,
391
, 
392
, 
393
 4 prospective RCTs,
395
, 
396
, 
397
, 
398
 a cohort study
394
 and meta‐analyses
399
, 
400
, 
401
 have evaluated the safety and efficacy of DOACs for cardioversion as an alternative to warfarin. The results were consistent and supported the idea that DOACs are an alternative to warfarin for patients undergoing cardioversion. For naïve patients, DOACs may be better for reducing the time before cardioversion, because the DOACs are effective from the day of starting, whereas warfarin takes at least several days to reach its therapeutic range. For patients with AF that requires immediate cardioversion because of hemodynamic instability in such clinical settings as angina, acute coronary syndrome, shock, or pulmonary edema, we should do it (if the duration of AF >48 h, with heparin i.v.) and should start and continue anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks.

After cardioversion and the restoration of sinus rhythm, functional recovery of the left atrium and left atrial appendage delay (i.e., atrial stunning) may take more than a few weeks.
402
 Meta‐analysis of 32 studies concerning cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter demonstrated that 98% of thromboembolic events occurred in the 10 days after cardioversion.
403
 The decision about long‐term anticoagulation therapy (beyond 4 weeks) is based on relapse of AF, which includes paroxysmal and asymptomatic forms, thromboembolic risk and bleeding risk (Figure 13).

Anticoagulant therapy for cardioversion. *2,000–5,000 U unfractionated heparin i.v. (evidence for the dose is poor). In case of AF lasting <48 h without anticoagulants, DOAC is recommended unless contraindicated as the effect of anticoagulation is rapid. AF, atrial fibrillation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; INR, international normalized ratio; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography.

An alternative to waiting 3 weeks before cardioversion is to perform transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to exclude thrombus. In patients with AF ≥48 h duration, a RCT comparing cardioversion with and without TEE was performed (ACUTE trial).
404
 The traditional arm (n=603) was without TEE and administered warfarin for 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after cardioversion. In the TEE arm (n=619), immediate cardioversion was performed after heparin i.v. if no thrombus was detected in the left atrium. If a thrombus was detected, warfarin therapy was performed for 3 weeks. Cardioversion was performed if no thrombus was detected after reevaluation of TEE. Warfarin was continued for 4 weeks after cardioversion. The number of days before cardioversion was significantly short in the TEE arm (mean 3.0 days vs 30.6 days), whereas the success rate of cardioversion and the rates of thromboembolism and major bleeding were not significantly different at 8 weeks after cardioversion. These results showed that TEE is an acceptable screening procedure for cardioversion of AF.
404

Prospective randomized trials with DOACs and warfarin for cardioversion of AF (X‐VerT, ENSURE‐AF, XANTUS, and EMANATE) included a TEE arm and confirmed the efficacy and safety.
395
, 
396
, 
397
, 
398
 If the risk of cerebral infarction is extremely high in patients with AF lasting <48 h, TEE is considered before cardioversion.

Cardioversion of atrial flutter also has the complication of cerebral infarction or systemic embolism, so anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or DOAC) should be applied as for AF before and after cardioversion.
405

406

### Perioperative Anticoagulation Management (e.g., Tooth Extraction, Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Surgery, etc)

Patients on anticoagulation therapy often undergo invasive procedures (e.g., examinations and treatments). Specific clinical departments that provide such invasive procedures face difficult decisions as to whether their patients need to be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulants during the perioperative period. Such decisions should be made on a patient‐by‐patient basis, taking several factors into account, such as the risk of thromboembolism, type of anticoagulant used, and the risk of bleeding associated with the particular invasive procedure to be performed. Physicians who are to perform such invasive procedures should consult with the clinic or hospital prescribing the anticoagulant to the patient to help decide whether the patient can be temporarily withdrawn from anticoagulation therapy. Furthermore, they should also consult with the patient to explain the risks associated with interruption, specifically the risk of thromboembolism, and receive consent.

The categories of bleeding risks associated with invasive procedures performed across different specialties are shown in Table 39. In general, to prevent thromboembolism, interruption of anticoagulation therapy is not recommended for patients undergoing invasive procedures in which hemostasis is possible. For invasive procedures that require interruption of anticoagulation therapy, the period of interruption should be kept to a minimum and the treatment should be re‐initiated as soon as hemostasis is confirmed. The categories shown in Table 39 are based on standard invasive procedures; it should be noted that interruption may still be needed in high bleeding risk cases for procedures that are categorized as low risk of bleeding. It should also be noted that the guidelines are specific for elective invasive procedures and do not apply to emergency procedures. Recommendations and levels of evidence for continuation of anticoagulant therapy during invasive procedures are shown in Table 40.

Classification of Elective Surgical Interventions According to Bleeding Risk

•Dental surgery

Safety of continuing oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin for patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures was shown in several RCTs,
407
, 
408
, 
409
, 
410
 and a meta‐analysis.
411
 In the meta‐analysis, perioperative continuation of warfarin was not associated with an increased risk for clinically significant bleeding or minor bleeding, compared with interrupting warfarin therapy. A review showed that approximately 1% of patients with warfarin therapy discontinued specifically for dental procedures had serious embolic complications (including deaths).
412
 Therefore, continuation of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin in patients undergoing dental extraction or minor dental procedures is recommended.

Evidence regarding oral anticoagulant therapy using DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is lacking. In a subanalysis of the RE‐LY trial, there was no significant difference in the rates of periprocedural ischemic stroke or systemic embolism between patients receiving dabigatran and those receiving warfarin (0.5% for both), who required surgery, including dental procedures.
413
 A study from Japan regarding the risk of bleeding in patients receiving a DOAC or warfarin without cessation reported that postoperative bleeding occurred in 4 extractions (3.1%) among 128 patients receiving DOACs (all extractions in DOAC patients were performed 6–7 h after taking the DOAC), and in 23 (8.8%) among 262 patients receiving warfarin, and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups.
414
 Thus, continuation of DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is recommended, as with the recommendation for warfarin.

It is reported that the incidence rate of stroke was approximately 1% in AF patients with adjusted anticoagulation (including withholding, reversal, or changing dose) who underwent endoscopy.
415
 In prospective observational studies, there was no significant difference for post‐procedural bleeding following endoscopy between patients with discontinued and continued anticoagulant therapy.
416
, 
417
 Diagnostic endoscopic procedures without biopsy can potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy, and expert opinion suggests that diagnostic endoscopy with biopsy can also potentially be performed for patients with continued anticoagulant therapy with controlled therapeutic INR,
418
, 
419
 but definite evidence is lacking. heparin bridging therapy for endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk significantly increased the risk of post‐procedural bleeding.
420
, 
421

The Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society published “Guidelines for gastroenterological endoscopy in patients undergoing antithrombotic treatment” in 2012,
422
, 
423
 and an Appendix including DOACs in 2017.
424
, 
425
 The guideline classified gastroenterological endoscopic examination and treatment procedures according to bleeding risk into 4 categories: (i) diagnostic gastroenterological endoscopic procedures without biopsy, (ii) endoscopic mucosal biopsy (excluding endoscopic ultrasonography‐guided fine‐needle aspiration), (iii) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with low bleeding risk, and (iv) gastroenterological endoscopic procedures with high bleeding risk. For category (i), withdrawal of warfarin or DOAC is not required. For categories (ii–iv), warfarin withdrawal is not required but it should be confirmed that the PT‐INR is within the therapeutic range. For patients receiving DOACs in category (ii) or (iii), DOAC withdrawal is not required, but performing the procedure outside the peak DOAC blood concentration estimated from the time of administration is recommended. Patients receiving DOACs in category (iv) should discontinue the DOAC on the morning of the procedure. Oral administration of DOAC may be resumed on the morning after the procedure.

Although there was no established evidence or standard management approach during surgery with high bleeding risk, discontinuation of warfarin therapy and heparin bridging has been performed empirically during the perioperative period.
426
, 
427
 However, the BRIDGE trial showed that the incidence of arterial thromboembolism was comparable between the no‐bridging group (0.4%) and the bridging group (0.3%), and the incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower in the no‐bridging group (1.3%) compared with the bridging group.
428
 Some observational studies reported the similar results to the BRIDGE trial.
429
, 
430
 Generally, routine heparin bridging is not needed for patients with AF who require an interruption in warfarin treatment for an elective invasive procedure with high bleeding risk.

On the other hand, heparin bridging is recommended to be considered for valvular AF patients (mechanical valve or rheumatic mitral stenosis), or non‐valvular AF patients at very high thromboembolic risk, such as history of ischemic stroke within 3 months or extremely high CHADS2 score. Analyses developed from the BRIDGE trial showed bridging to only be beneficial for patients with HAS‐BLED scores ≤2 and with CHA2DS2‐VASc scores of ≥6 (presumed CHADS2 score of ≥4).
431

A subanalysis of the international multicenter phase III trials of each DOAC regarding perioperative events has been published.
413
, 
432
, 
433
, 
434
 Meta‐analysis of these studies showed no significant difference in the risks of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, minor bleeding, and overall mortality at 30 days following surgery or procedure between perioperative interruption of DOAC and interruption of warfarin.
435

In the case of invasive procedures that carry a high risk for major bleeding, it is recommended to take the last DOAC dose ≥48 h before surgery.
330
 For patients on dabigatran with CCR ≥80 mL/min, the last administration should be taken ≥48 h, for those with CCR 50–79 mL/min it should be taken ≥72 h, and for those with CCR 30–49 mL/min it should be taken ≥96 h before surgery.

Perioperative heparin bridging is not recommended in patients who discontinued DOACs before surgery.
330
 In a substudy of the RE‐LY trial, with dabigatran interruption, bridging was associated with significantly higher incidence of major bleeding than no‐bridging, but for any thromboembolic events there was no difference between bridging and no‐bridging.
436
 In general, heparin bridging in not needed during the interruption of DOAC therapy, but it can be considered in patients at very high thromboembolic risk as described above.

Two RCTs are available regarding bridging anticoagulation using warfarin in patients who required cardiac implantable electronic device surgery.
437
, 
438
 They concluded that a strategy of bridging therapy at the time of device implantation markedly increased the incidence of clinically significant device‐pocket hematoma as compared with continued warfarin treatment, and thromboembolic complications were rare and did not differ significantly between bridging therapy and continued warfarin treatment. Additionally, device‐pocket hematoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of infection requiring hospitalization.
439

There are several observational studies that show continued DOAC treatment during device implantation surgery was not significantly associated with increased incidence of clinically relevant bleeding events.
440
, 
441
, 
442

Patients undergoing AF ablation have a high risk of bleeding and thromboembolism, requiring appropriate anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period. Large‐scale observational studies of AF ablation demonstrated that cardiac tamponade and perforation are common hemorrhagic complications, with the incidence ranging from 1.2% to 2.5% and from 0.9% to 1,5%, respectively.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 The Japanese Catheter Ablation Registry of Atrial Fibrillation (J‐CARAF), which included 8,319 cases, also reported similar incidence rates.
447
 Thus, although technical advancements are expected, it remains essential to consider the risk of hemorrhagic complications. The risk of thromboembolism is further increased in left atrial ablation, with 0.1–0.3% of patients developing cerebral infarction during the perioperative period.
443
, 
444
, 
445
, 
446
 Collectively, appropriate management of anticoagulation therapy during the perioperative period is essential.

A recent international expert consensus recommended that warfarin be administered uninterrupted.
448
 This recommendation is based on evidence from an RCT (COMPARE trial) demonstrating that the use of warfarin reduced the risk of hemorrhagic complications in addition to that of embolism.
449

Similarly, recent RCTs have generated additional evidence on the use of DOACs. By comparing dabigatran (RE‐CIRCUIT trial),
450
 rivaroxaban (VENTURE‐AF trial),
451
 apixaban (AXAFA‐AFNET 5 trial),
452
 and edoxaban (ELIMINATE‐AF trial)
453
 with uninterrupted warfarin, they found that the efficacy and safety of uninterrupted administration of DOACs during the perioperative period are equivalent or superior to those of warfarin in terms of the risk of embolism and hemorrhagic complications. However, these studies included relatively small numbers of patients. In addition, variations in trial design should be noted; these variations included the half‐life of each DOAC and when the last dose was administered prior to the procedure.

There are limited data on minimally interrupted DOAC therapy, in which administration is interrupted 1–2 times prior to the procedure. An RCT conducted in Japan (ABRIDGE‐J trial) compared minimally interrupted dabigatran and uninterrupted warfarin, and demonstrated that the risk of hemorrhage was higher in the warfarin group, but the risk of embolism was equivalent between groups.
454
 Another Japanese single‐center RCT compared uninterrupted and minimally interrupted DOAC, and reported no significant difference in the incidence of embolism or hemorrhagic complications among the 4 DOACs, suggesting that minimal interruption is acceptable.
455
 A recent multicenter study conducted across hospitals in the Kyushu region (KYU‐RABLE study) also demonstrated that uninterrupted administration of edoxaban during the perioperative period (immediately after the procedure on the day of the surgery) is effective and safe.
456

Many factors should be considered in order to select the appropriate DOAC, as well as to determine whether interruption is needed (and if so, for how long) during the perioperative period for patients undergoing AF ablation. These factors include the patient‐specific risk of thromboembolism and bleeding, and differences in drug metabolism and route of excretion among DOACs, in addition to the availability of neutralizing agents such as idarucizumab for dabigatran
332
 and Andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors (unapproved, as of March 2020).

414
 Thus, continuation of DOACs in patients undergoing dental procedures is recommended, as with the recommendation for warfarin.

It is reported that the incidence rate of stroke was approximately 1% in AF patients with adjusted anticoagulation (including withholding, reversal, or changing dose) who underwent endoscopy.

### Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Concomitant With Ischemic Heart Disease

The prevalence of the coexistence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported to be 8–15% in Japan,
307
, 
308
, 
362
, 
458
, 
459
 and these patients are encountered commonly in clinical practice. The JCS 2018 “Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome”
460
 and on “Revascularization of Stable Coronary Artery Disease”
461
 recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (P2Y12 inhibitor) after stent implantation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as class I/evidence level A. Therefore, in patients with AF concomitant with undergoing PCI, triple therapy defined as a DAPT plus an OAC for stroke prevention is needed. In 2019, the Academic Research Consortium proposed a consensus definition of patients at a high bleeding risk (HBR) among those undergoing PCI, which was based on a review of the available evidence. The use of OACs is fulfilled by the major criteria for HBR patients who are defined as having an annual incidence of bleeding events estimated to be >4%.
462
 Because the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy in these HBR patients would dramatically increase bleeding events, antithrombotic management focusing on the prevention of bleeding events is becoming the main trend worldwide.

The WOEST trial
463
 (n=573) was the first to test the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a VKA plus clopidogrel as a counterpart to the triple therapy of a VKA plus DAPT. Among the patients taking OACs and undergoing a PCI, dual therapy reduced the annual incidence of major bleeding more than the triple therapy, and surprisingly, the annual incidence of the composite cardiovascular events also lowered with the dual therapy. Regarding the benefit of VKA monotherapy as compared with dual therapy in AF patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), a nationwide Danish cohort registry provided insightful results that VKA monotherapy had a similar risk of a myocardial infarction/coronary death but decreased risk of serious bleeding events, as compared with dual therapy of a VKA plus aspirin or VKA plus clopidogrel.
464
 An open‐label randomized trial comparing an OAC alone (including four‐thirds of the patients taking warfarin and the remaining patients taking DOACs) and dual therapy with an OAC plus single antiplatelet in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI (OAC‐ALONE: Optimizing Antithrombotic Care in patients with AtriaL fibrillatiON and coronary stEnt study) was conducted in Japan.
465
 In that trial, there were no differences in the incidences of the primary endpoint (composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism) and major bleeding between the OAC alone therapy and dual therapy, which supported the results obtained from the nationwide Danish cohort study.
464

As DOACs are being increasingly used as an alternative to warfarin in clinical practice,
362
 the clinical evidence for DOACs in antithrombotic therapy management among AF patients undergoing PCI is becoming established. The PIONEER PCI trial
466
 compared the primary safety outcome and the occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke) between dual therapy with rivaroxaban 15 mg plus P2Y12 inhibitor (n=709) for 12 months and triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT adjusted for 1, 6, or 12 months (n=706). Similar to the WOEST trial, the dual therapy had a lower risk of clinically significant bleeding, but the rate of a major adverse cardiovascular event was similar between the dual and triple therapies. The RE‐DUAL PCI trial
467
 (n=2,725), which compared dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) over 12 months and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) with warfarin‐based triple therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (for 1–3 months), showed a similar result that the dual therapy had a lower risk of bleeding and was noninferior to the triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events. In the AUGUSTUS trial,
468
 4,614 AF patients who underwent PCI with a P2Y12 inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive apixaban or VKA and aspirin or a matching placebo for 6 months. The P2Y12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than the regimens that included VKA, aspirin, or both. The ENTRUST trial
469
 included 1,506 AF patients who had undergone PCI and were randomly assigned to either edoxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or VKA plus DAPT (for 1–12 months). The trial also showed consistent results of a bleeding risk reduction and an equivalent ischemic risk of the dual therapy as for the triple therapy. Although these 4 trials established the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor as compared with a warfarin‐based triple therapy in AF patients with CAD, the endpoints in the trials were only evaluated during a limited duration of 1 year after PCI.

Regarding the prognostic effect of DOACs in patients with stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI, the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic events with rivaroxaban in patiEnts with stable coronary artery disease Study) trial was published in 2019.
470
 This multicenter, open‐label trial conducted in Japan randomly assigned 2,236 patients with AF who had undergone PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban or a combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination‐therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, and surprisingly, the risk of the primary efficacy endpoint (composite of a stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause) was reduced by 28%, and was statistically noninferior to the combination therapy. Similar data, even for DOACs, supporting the results from the nationwide Danish registry
464
 and OAC‐ALONE trial
465
 were shown by this trial in Japan.

On the other hand, to explore the optimal duration of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy, the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial,
471
 a randomized open‐label study, was conducted. The result was that 6 weeks of triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after PCI in patients receiving an OAC was noninferior to 6 months of a triple therapy with respect to ischemic events and major bleeding events. Furthermore, in the WOEST trial
463
 and the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 as described above, the patients assigned to the dual therapy group were de‐escalated from a triple therapy to a dual therapy with a DOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor by cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase (maximum 2 weeks in the AUGUSTUS trial) after the PCI, which strongly supported the clinical acceptability of an early termination of aspirin after PCI. Meta‐analyses have also suggested that aspirin should be terminated early after PCI.
472
, 
473
 On the basis of these data in this field described above, this guideline recommends that the timing of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and clopidogrel should be within 2 weeks after PCI (Figure 14). The present European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines
21
, 
330
, 
474
 also consider dual therapy with clopidogrel and an OAC immediately after PCI as an alternative to triple therapy in those for whom the bleeding risk overweighs the ischemic risk, and dual therapy (aspirin is only used in the periprocedural phase after PCI) is recommended as a default strategy in the North American guidelines.
475

Recommended choice and duration of antithrombic therapy in atrial fibrillation concomitant with ischemic heart disease. *1Short duration of 6 months of dual therapy can be considered in patients with a very high bleeding risk. *2Continuation of dual therapy with an OAC and aspirin (or P2Y12 inhibitor) for longer than 12 months can be considered in patients with a very high thromboembolic risk. PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, OAC, oral anticoagulant.

Based on the increased evidence in this field as described above, this guideline provides a flow chart (Figure 14) and Table 41 for antithrombic management in AF patients with concomitant IHD.

 However, the approved dose of prasugrel was reduced (loading dose, 20 mg; maintenance dose, 3.75 mg) because East Asian individuals have a higher bleeding risk than Western individuals. Therefore, this guideline allows for the use of prasugrel when considering its use in clinical practice in Japan. While balancing between the thromboembolic‐vs.‐bleeding risk, a default strategy is de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor by ceasing aspirin within 2 weeks after PCI.

 and a subanalysis revealed a consistent benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and clopidogrel over a warfarin‐based triple therapy, regardless of ACS or stable CAD. Therefore, dual therapy is recommended as a default strategy even in patients with ACS. Nevertheless, the subanalysis of the AUGUSTUS trial demonstrated that a stent thrombosis at 1 month was numerically but not significantly lower in the triple therapy group with concomitant use of aspirin than in the dual therapy group after early cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase after PCI,
485
 implying the need for caution in patients with a very high risk of stent‐driven ischemic events. Therefore, triple therapy for longer than 1 month and up to 3 months by physicians’ discretion is acceptable in patients with a very high stent‐driven ischemic risk, as shown in Table 42.

 In contrast, triple therapy for longer than 1 month cannot be recommended in patients with a high bleeding risk (class III/evidence level B).

In the chronic phase beyond 1 year after PCI, an OAC alone can be recommended as a default strategy (class I/evidence level B), which is derived from the results of the AFIR trial, OAC‐ALONE trial, and the nationwide Danish cohort study.

479
, 
480
, 
481
 Furthermore, the AUGUSTUS trial
468
 indicated that apixaban had a similar efficacy and in particular, a bleeding risk, superior to warfarin. For these reasons, a DOAC should be used unless the patient has a contraindication (class I/evidence level A).

 When warfarin is used in combination with antiplatelet therapy, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be maintained in the lower part of the recommended target range and the time in the therapeutic range should be > 65% (class IIb/evidence level C).

### Randomized Clinical Trials in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Concomitant With Ischemic Heart Disease

The prevalence of the coexistence of ischemic heart disease (IHD) among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported to be 8–15% in Japan,
307
, 
308
, 
362
, 
458
, 
459
 and these patients are encountered commonly in clinical practice. The JCS 2018 “Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome”
460
 and on “Revascularization of Stable Coronary Artery Disease”
461
 recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) of aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor antagonist (P2Y12 inhibitor) after stent implantation in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as class I/evidence level A. Therefore, in patients with AF concomitant with undergoing PCI, triple therapy defined as a DAPT plus an OAC for stroke prevention is needed. In 2019, the Academic Research Consortium proposed a consensus definition of patients at a high bleeding risk (HBR) among those undergoing PCI, which was based on a review of the available evidence. The use of OACs is fulfilled by the major criteria for HBR patients who are defined as having an annual incidence of bleeding events estimated to be >4%.
462
 Because the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy in these HBR patients would dramatically increase bleeding events, antithrombotic management focusing on the prevention of bleeding events is becoming the main trend worldwide.

The WOEST trial
463
 (n=573) was the first to test the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a VKA plus clopidogrel as a counterpart to the triple therapy of a VKA plus DAPT. Among the patients taking OACs and undergoing a PCI, dual therapy reduced the annual incidence of major bleeding more than the triple therapy, and surprisingly, the annual incidence of the composite cardiovascular events also lowered with the dual therapy. Regarding the benefit of VKA monotherapy as compared with dual therapy in AF patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), a nationwide Danish cohort registry provided insightful results that VKA monotherapy had a similar risk of a myocardial infarction/coronary death but decreased risk of serious bleeding events, as compared with dual therapy of a VKA plus aspirin or VKA plus clopidogrel.
464
 An open‐label randomized trial comparing an OAC alone (including four‐thirds of the patients taking warfarin and the remaining patients taking DOACs) and dual therapy with an OAC plus single antiplatelet in patients with AF and stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI (OAC‐ALONE: Optimizing Antithrombotic Care in patients with AtriaL fibrillatiON and coronary stEnt study) was conducted in Japan.
465
 In that trial, there were no differences in the incidences of the primary endpoint (composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or systemic embolism) and major bleeding between the OAC alone therapy and dual therapy, which supported the results obtained from the nationwide Danish cohort study.
464

As DOACs are being increasingly used as an alternative to warfarin in clinical practice,
362
 the clinical evidence for DOACs in antithrombotic therapy management among AF patients undergoing PCI is becoming established. The PIONEER PCI trial
466
 compared the primary safety outcome and the occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke) between dual therapy with rivaroxaban 15 mg plus P2Y12 inhibitor (n=709) for 12 months and triple therapy with VKA plus DAPT adjusted for 1, 6, or 12 months (n=706). Similar to the WOEST trial, the dual therapy had a lower risk of clinically significant bleeding, but the rate of a major adverse cardiovascular event was similar between the dual and triple therapies. The RE‐DUAL PCI trial
467
 (n=2,725), which compared dual therapy with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily) over 12 months and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) with warfarin‐based triple therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin (for 1–3 months), showed a similar result that the dual therapy had a lower risk of bleeding and was noninferior to the triple therapy with respect to the risk of thromboembolic events. In the AUGUSTUS trial,
468
 4,614 AF patients who underwent PCI with a P2Y12 inhibitor were randomly assigned to receive apixaban or VKA and aspirin or a matching placebo for 6 months. The P2Y12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than the regimens that included VKA, aspirin, or both. The ENTRUST trial
469
 included 1,506 AF patients who had undergone PCI and were randomly assigned to either edoxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months or VKA plus DAPT (for 1–12 months). The trial also showed consistent results of a bleeding risk reduction and an equivalent ischemic risk of the dual therapy as for the triple therapy. Although these 4 trials established the clinical benefit of dual therapy with a DOAC and P2Y12 inhibitor as compared with a warfarin‐based triple therapy in AF patients with CAD, the endpoints in the trials were only evaluated during a limited duration of 1 year after PCI.

Regarding the prognostic effect of DOACs in patients with stable CAD beyond 1 year after PCI, the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic events with rivaroxaban in patiEnts with stable coronary artery disease Study) trial was published in 2019.
470
 This multicenter, open‐label trial conducted in Japan randomly assigned 2,236 patients with AF who had undergone PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) more than 1 year earlier or who had angiographically confirmed CAD not requiring revascularization to receive monotherapy with rivaroxaban or a combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single antiplatelet agent. The trial was stopped early because of increased mortality in the combination‐therapy group. Rivaroxaban monotherapy was superior to combination therapy for the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, and surprisingly, the risk of the primary efficacy endpoint (composite of a stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring revascularization, or death from any cause) was reduced by 28%, and was statistically noninferior to the combination therapy. Similar data, even for DOACs, supporting the results from the nationwide Danish registry
464
 and OAC‐ALONE trial
465
 were shown by this trial in Japan.

On the other hand, to explore the optimal duration of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy, the ISAR‐TRIPLE trial,
471
 a randomized open‐label study, was conducted. The result was that 6 weeks of triple therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel after PCI in patients receiving an OAC was noninferior to 6 months of a triple therapy with respect to ischemic events and major bleeding events. Furthermore, in the WOEST trial
463
 and the 4 DOAC AF PCI trials
466
, 
467
, 
468
, 
469
 as described above, the patients assigned to the dual therapy group were de‐escalated from a triple therapy to a dual therapy with a DOAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor by cessation of aspirin in the periprocedural phase (maximum 2 weeks in the AUGUSTUS trial) after the PCI, which strongly supported the clinical acceptability of an early termination of aspirin after PCI. Meta‐analyses have also suggested that aspirin should be terminated early after PCI.
472
, 
473
 On the basis of these data in this field described above, this guideline recommends that the timing of de‐escalation from triple therapy to dual therapy with an OAC and clopidogrel should be within 2 weeks after PCI (Figure 14). The present European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines
21
, 
330
, 
474
 also consider dual therapy with clopidogrel and an OAC immediately after PCI as an alternative to triple therapy in those for whom the bleeding risk overweighs the ischemic risk, and dual therapy (aspirin is only used in the periprocedural phase after PCI) is recommended as a default strategy in the North American guidelines.
475

Recommended choice and duration of antithrombic therapy in atrial fibrillation concomitant with ischemic heart disease. *1Short duration of 6 months of dual therapy can be considered in patients with a very high bleeding risk. *2Continuation of dual therapy with an OAC and aspirin (or P2Y12 inhibitor) for longer than 12 months can be considered in patients with a very high thromboembolic risk. PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention, OAC, oral anticoagulant.

### Management of Hemorrhagic Complications: Hemostatic Procedure, Antidotes, etc.

An observational study with 4,009 patients undergoing antithrombotic therapy in Japan showed that the incidence of major bleeding with single antiplatelet, multiple antiplatelet agents, warfarin, and warfarin plus antiplatelet agents was 1.2%/year, 2.0%/year, 2.1%/year, and 3.6%/year, and the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.3%/year, 0.6%/year, 0.6%/year, and 1.0%/year, respectively.
327
 We need to recognize that serious bleeding can occur at a certain frequency during antithrombotic therapy, and that the risk increases with the concomitant use of antithrombotic agents. We also need to know how to manage hemorrhagic complications (Figure 15, Table 43).

Treatment for active bleeding during anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; PT‐INR, prothrombin time‐international normalized ratio.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for the Management of Active Bleeding

Abbreviation: COR, class of recommendation; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant; FFP, fresh frozen plasma; GOR, grade of recommendation; INR, international normalized ratio; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; PCC, prothrombin complex concentrate; PT, prothrombin time.

In the case of mild bleeding, we should consider correct continuation of antithrombotic therapy rather than discontinuation without careful consideration. For moderate‐to‐severe bleeding, it is recommended to discontinue the antithrombotic agents, stop the bleeding, stabilize circulatory dynamics with appropriate drip infusion, and lower the blood pressure during intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage (recommended class I).
487
, 
488
, 
489
 Administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and vitamin K (recommended class I), fresh frozen plasma (FFP, recommended class I) and recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) are recommended for the purpose of suppressing bleeding tendency during warfarin therapy and acute severe bleeding, or for urgent surgery/procedures where serious bleeding is anticipated.
490
, 
491
, 
492
, 
493
, 
494
, 
495
, 
496

The administration of both PCC and vitamin K has the fastest and surest effect.
497
, 
498
, 
499
 Randomized controlled trials of PCC + vitamin K versus FFP + vitamin K performed in patients on warfarin treatment who had severe bleeding or suddenly needed invasive medical treatment showed a non‐inferiority of the hemostatic effect of PCC + vitamin K against FFP + vitamin K.
497
, 
498
 In addition, PCC had a shorter administration time, a shorter time to hemostasis, and a smaller volume than that of FFP. From the standpoint of pasteurization and nanofiltration, PCC is superior to FFP for safety.

The administration dose of the PCC is determined according to the INR value and body weight. PCC of 25 IU/kg (max. dose of 2,500 IU) for INR of ≥2.0 and <4.0, 35 IU/kg (max. dose of 3,500 IU) for INR of ≥4.0 and <6.0, or 50 IU/kg (max. dose of 5,000 IU) for INR ≥6.0 should be administered. Usage and dosage for patients with INR <2.0 have not been officially recognized.

However, a pharmacometric simulation model analysis showing the relationship of INR and coagulation factor activity using the PCC Phase III study data
497
, 
498
, 
499
 showed that PCC doses of 25 IU/kg, 20 IU/kg, and 15 IU/kg were needed at INRs 3.1, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively, to achieve both coagulant factor II and X activities of ≥50% in more than 80% of patients at 30 min after administration of PCC.
500
 Therefore, if urgent correction is required in a patient with INR <2.0, a dose of 20 IU/kg for INR >1.6 and 15 IU/kg for INR ≤ 1.6 might be considered.

In addition, studies in a small number of cases have been reported suggesting the usefulness of administering 15–25 IU/kg of PCC for INR <2.0.
501
, 
502
 For correction during heparin therapy, dilute protamine sulfate is slowly infused.
503

The incidence of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy is equivalent or less than that of warfarin. For bleeding, in addition to hemostasis treatment, we should consider discontinuation of DOACs according to the severity of hemorrhagic complications during DOAC therapy and promotion of diuresis excretion by appropriate infusion. Administration of PCC (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) and that of recombinant factor VII preparations (not covered by insurance, recommended class IIb) can be considered as measures against bleeding during DOAC therapy, but they have not been examined sufficiently. Dabigatran may be removed by hemodialysis because it has a low binding rate to proteins in the blood. For bleeding early after oral administration of each DOAC, gastric lavage or oral administration of activated charcoal may be considered to suppress the increase in blood concentration by suppressing absorption from the digestive tract.
504

Idarucizumab, a specific neutralizing antibody, is used during dabigatran therapy. To suppress the bleeding tendency during dabigatran therapy with acute severe bleeding or for urgent surgery/procedures in which significant bleeding is anticipated, idarucizumab is administered within 24 h after the last oral dose of dabigatran.
332
 Because a high blood concentration may be sustained in patients with renal dysfunction or oral administration of P‐glycoprotein inhibitors, we may consider administration of idarucizumab for up to 48 h in those patients. Regardless of the dose or time after oral administration, 5 g idarucizumab (two 2.5 g vials) is administered. The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is rapidly and completely neutralized within 1 min after the administration and the neutralizing effect is sustained for 24 h.

Dabigatran can be administered 24 h after the administration of idarucizumab, and other anticoagulants can be administered within 24 h. Neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran may induce a hypercoagulable state prior to the introduction of dabigatran, but idarucizumab itself has no effect on coagulation or fibrinolysis. Therefore, if cerebral infarction develops in a patient on dabigatran treatment, there is an option to administer intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt‐PA) after neutralizing the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran by administration of idarucizumab.
505

If it is necessary to correct the effects of factor Xa inhibitors, administration of an antidote, Andexanet alfa (unapproved at January 2022) or ciraparantag (unapproved at January 2022) may be considered.
457
, 
506
 Andexanet alfa is a decoy protein of coagulation factor Xa, and the corrective effect can be sustained by intravenous infusion after a fixed amount of intravenous injection.
457
 The dose varies depending on the type of factor Xa inhibitor. In the USA, it was approved as an antidote for rivaroxaban and apixaban in May 2018. In Japan, it is under development as an antidote for all factor Xa inhibitors. Ciraparantag is a low molecular weight compound that has attracted attention because it is suggested to have a neutralizing effect on not only factor Xa inhibitors but also thrombin inhibitors and heparin, but its development has been delayed.
506

If resumption of anticoagulant therapy is indicated, considering the source of hemorrhage and the state of hemostasis after hemostatic treatment, surgery, or other invasive procedure, it should be resumed as soon as possible to prevent thromboembolism.

### Rate Control Therapy

Treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF) include pharmacotherapy and catheter ablation. Pharmacotherapy is a priority, but may be considered positively in patients for whom catheter ablation is indicated. Anticoagulant therapy should be firstly considered as pharmacotherapy for AF. As the next step, rhythm control therapy and rate control therapy were previously recommended as similar, but in recent years, rate control therapy has become a higher priority than rhythm control therapy. Clinical trials such as AFFIRM
507
 and RACE
508
 conducted in Western countries, and J‐RHYTHM
509
 in Japan showed that rhythm control therapy and rate control therapy did not differ in hospitalization for all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, and aggravation of heart failure (HF). Similar results were obtained in AF‐CHF
229
 with AF associated with HF.

Based on this evidence, in the European guideline,
21
 easy rate control therapy is ranked high, but rhythm control therapy is considered in patients with strong subjective symptoms or patients with impaired quality of life (QOL).

Drugs used to control heart rate include β‐blockers, digitalis, non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, and the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone. Among them, β‐blockers have added value, such as a protective effect on the myocardium and improvement of life prognosis, and can be expected to improve symptoms by relaxing sympathetic tone. Therefore, β‐blockers are widely used, compared with other drugs, in Europe, the USA, and Japan
509
,

 (Table 44, Figure 16).

Treatment flowchart of rate control therapy for tachycardiac AF. AF, atrial fibrillation; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.

Intravenous drugs are mainly used for urgently controlling the heart rate during the acute phase. β‐blockers, digitalis, and amiodarone are used.

Intravenous β‐blockers include landiolol, esmolol, and propranolol, but usage of the ultra‐short‐acting β
1‐blocker landiolol is high in Japan. JL‐KNIGHT,
511
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF/atrial flutter after thoracic surgery, showed that the heart rate inhibitory effect and recovery of sinus rhythm were superior to that of diltiazem. J‐Land,
512
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF and impaired cardiac function (complicated with HF), showed that heart rate‐suppressing effect of landiolol was superior to that of digoxin, and there was no difference in the occurrence of side effects. It was shown that the effectiveness of landiolol as a heart rate regulator can be expected for tachycardiac AF associated with HF, but it has been shown to be less effective in patients with extremely impaired cardiac function.
513
, 
514
 Moreover, the tachycardia suppression effect on atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia cannot be expected as much as for AF.

When landiolol is used in patients with low cardiac function, the dose is gradually increased from a small dosage (1 μg/kg/min; max. dosage 10 μg/kg/min). If the effect is insufficient, add digitalis. Intravenous non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists (diltiazem and verapamil) are contraindicated for tachycardiac AF associated with low cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%.

Amiodarone may be used when attempting to control the heart rate of tachycardiac AF while considering defibrillation (not covered by insurance).

The first‐line treatment is a β‐blocker. In a clinical study that verified the prognostic effect of β‐blockers and digitalis, β‐blockers improved the prognosis of patients regardless of the degree of cardiac function, but digitalis did not show such an effect.
516

Although there are many types of oral β‐blockers, those without intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA: bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, etc.) are used for rate control therapy. MAIN‐AF
517
 for bisoprolol and AF carvedilol
518
 for carvedilol demonstrated a heart rate‐reducing effect in patients with persistent or chronic AF. A bisoprolol patch was also recently approved by BISONO‐AF
519
 because of its heart rate‐reducing effect in patients with AF. In a comparison of bisoprolol and carvedilol, bisoprolol, which has a high cardiac (β
1) selectivity, has a stronger heart rate inhibitory effect. Therefore, when used in elderly patients with HF, it is necessary to pay attention to severe bradycardia as a side effect, as shown in CIBIS‐ELD.
520

In a meta‐analysis of an old clinical trial that verified the efficacy of β‐blockers in patients with HF,
521
 it was reported that the effect of β‐blockers on prognosis was not observed in patients with AF. However, recent clinical studies reported thereafter that β‐blockers have a prognostic effect on AF with HF.
522
, 
523
, 
524
 The current usage of β‐blockers seems to have a prognostic effect on AF associated with HF.

Verapamil and diltiazem, which are non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, are used in patients with tachycardiac AF because they have not only antihypertensive effects but also relatively strong bradycardiac effects due to atrioventricular conduction inhibition. However, because they also have a negative inotropic effect, their use is limited to cases where cardiac function is maintained. Negative inotropic effects are more likely to occur in patients with impaired cardiac function, and verapamil is stronger than diltiazem.

In the guidelines in Japan and Europe,
21
, 
250
 non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists are contraindicated in patients with HF and impaired cardiac function (LVEF <40%). Therefore, when selecting a non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, it is necessary to check cardiac function by echocardiography or blood test (BNP level).

Digoxin or methyldigoxin is used. Digitalis also has a cardiotonic action, and is often used in patients with tachycardiac AF with impaired cardiac function. However, as shown in the European guidelines,
21
 it is not used as a first‐line drug, but as a second‐line drug. Digitalis has a heart rate‐reducing effect at rest, but a weaker effect on exercise. The J‐RHYTHM Registry subanalysis showed that digitalis alone had no effect on the prognosis,
525
 but it has been shown in the USA and Europe that mortality increases with long‐term use in patients with AF.
516
, 
526
, 
527
 Therefore, long‐term use should be avoided as much as possible.

Because both digoxin and methyldigoxin are drugs excreted by the kidney, administration in patients with impaired renal function may result in digitalis toxicity. It is necessary to periodically measure the blood concentration and adjust the dosage for the optimum concentration.

The target heart rate is set in patients with persistent or permanent AF. Traditionally, the heart rate of AF was stated as <80 beats/min at rest and <110 (115) beast/min during exercise. In RACE II,
528
 it was verified in patients with permanent AF whether or not strict heart rate control should be performed. As a result, there is no difference in event rate between strict rate control therapy (resting heart rate <80 beats/min) and lenient rate control therapy (resting heart rate <110 beats/min). Therefore, it is important to individualize the control of heart rate to reduce subjective symptoms and signs of HF.

European guidelines
21
 state that the AF heart rate at rest should be <110 beats/min. This is not supported by clear evidence, and it is important to adjust the heart rate appropriately while considering subjective symptoms and QOL in each patient.

### Acute Control

Intravenous drugs are mainly used for urgently controlling the heart rate during the acute phase. β‐blockers, digitalis, and amiodarone are used.

Intravenous β‐blockers include landiolol, esmolol, and propranolol, but usage of the ultra‐short‐acting β
1‐blocker landiolol is high in Japan. JL‐KNIGHT,
511
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF/atrial flutter after thoracic surgery, showed that the heart rate inhibitory effect and recovery of sinus rhythm were superior to that of diltiazem. J‐Land,
512
 which was performed in patients with tachycardiac AF and impaired cardiac function (complicated with HF), showed that heart rate‐suppressing effect of landiolol was superior to that of digoxin, and there was no difference in the occurrence of side effects. It was shown that the effectiveness of landiolol as a heart rate regulator can be expected for tachycardiac AF associated with HF, but it has been shown to be less effective in patients with extremely impaired cardiac function.
513
, 
514
 Moreover, the tachycardia suppression effect on atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia cannot be expected as much as for AF.
515

When landiolol is used in patients with low cardiac function, the dose is gradually increased from a small dosage (1 μg/kg/min; max. dosage 10 μg/kg/min). If the effect is insufficient, add digitalis. Intravenous non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists (diltiazem and verapamil) are contraindicated for tachycardiac AF associated with low cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%.

Amiodarone may be used when attempting to control the heart rate of tachycardiac AF while considering defibrillation (not covered by insurance).

### Long‐Term Control

The first‐line treatment is a β‐blocker. In a clinical study that verified the prognostic effect of β‐blockers and digitalis, β‐blockers improved the prognosis of patients regardless of the degree of cardiac function, but digitalis did not show such an effect.

### Non‐Dihydropyridine Ca2+ Channel Antagonists

Verapamil and diltiazem, which are non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel antagonists, are used in patients with tachycardiac AF because they have not only antihypertensive effects but also relatively strong bradycardiac effects due to atrioventricular conduction inhibition. However, because they also have a negative inotropic effect, their use is limited to cases where cardiac function is maintained.

### Target Heart Rate in Rate Control Therapy

The target heart rate is set in patients with persistent or permanent AF. Traditionally, the heart rate of AF was stated as <80 beats/min at rest and <110 (115) beast/min during exercise. In RACE II,
528
 it was verified in patients with permanent AF whether or not strict heart rate control should be performed. As a result, there is no difference in event rate between strict rate control therapy (resting heart rate <80 beats/min) and lenient rate control therapy (resting heart rate <110 beats/min). Therefore, it is important to individualize the control of heart rate to reduce subjective symptoms and signs of HF.

European guidelines
21
 state that the AF heart rate at rest should be <110 beats/min. This is not supported by clear evidence, and it is important to adjust the heart rate appropriately while considering subjective symptoms and QOL in each patient.

### Rhythm Control Therapy

AF, cardiac output is decreased and thrombus formation is enhanced due to the loss of effective atrial contraction. Additionally, irregular beats and tachycardia cause various clinical symptoms such as palpitation, chest discomfort, etc. Therefore, recovery of sinus rhythm itself has great benefit. However, clinical procedures aimed at sinus rhythm recovery, including pharmacological and non‐pharmacological approaches, have not only their benefits but also various risks related to these therapies. The adequacy of treatment must be judged in the balance between risk and benefit.

The mega‐trials that compared rhythm control (sinus rhythm maintenance) and rate control (heart rate control) failed to exhibit any difference in mortality.
229
, 
507
 In the J‐RHYTHM trial, the superiority of rhythm control was demonstrated, at least for paroxysmal AF, by using specific endpoints including quality of life (QOL).
509
 In those trials, rhythm therapy was mainly pharmacological. However, a recent trial that compared rhythm control and rate control by using catheter ablation as the main therapy for rhythm control, demonstrated recovery of cardiac function in cases of left ventricular dysfunction.
222
 Therefore, the value and therapeutic procedures of rhythm control must be reevaluated.

Because the same antiarrhythmic agents are commonly selected for recovery of sinus rhythm (defibrillation) and prevention of AF (sinus rhythm maintenance), the 2008 guideline
530
 unified them, but the 2013 guideline
2
 listed them separately. In this guideline, by considering various therapeutic options, including catheter ablation, especially for preventive therapy, these 2 concepts are described separately. In the selection list of antiarrhythmic agents, the usage record in Japan was weighted. In the selection of antiarrhythmic agents, safety must be the most important issue because pharmacological rhythm control should be understood as therapy for QOL improvement instead of decrease in mortality.

At the time of AF interruption (defibrillation), great attention must be paid to the possibility of systemic embolism by the pumping out intra‐atrial thrombus. It is important to confirm the absence of intra‐atrial thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography or to perform appropriate anticoagulation therapy, especially in patients in whom the possibility of more than 48‐h continuation of AF cannot be denied. Excepting emergencies, greatest attention must be paid to prevention of systemic embolism.

In the case of emergency in which hemodynamic stability cannot be expected, QRS‐triggered direct‐current defibrillation with ≥100 J electrical shock will be rapid and effective under appropriate anesthesia and respiratory control (Figure 17, Table 45).

Flow‐chart for defibrillation of AF. *1The possibility of 48‐h continuation of AF cannot be denied; essential to confirm the absence of intra‐atrial thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography or to perform appropriate anticoagulation therapy for 3 weeks (see “Chapter V. 3. Anticoagulation Therapy” for details). *2Hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease. *3Even without hemodynamic instability, rate control therapy might be combined in cases of symptomatic tachycardia (see “Chapter V. 4. Rate Control Therapy” for details). *4Insurance coverage for Amiodarone is approved only for patients with AF with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart failure in Japan. *5Rhythm control therapy should be performed within 48 h of AF onset by considering efficacy of therapy as well as prevention of systemic embolism.

In addition to emergency treatment, direct‐current defibrillation should be applied when patients prefer it, when AF is refractory to pharmacological defibrillation, and when use of antiarrhythmic agents is considered more dangerous than direct‐current defibrillation. Especially in cases of AF complicated with organic heart disease such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents will be suppressed and the risk of proarrhythmia will be increased. In cases of heart failure, amiodarone might be used for the purpose of defibrillation, but it will take longer to evaluate its efficacy, so its use should be limited to patients in a stable condition. In case of symptomatic tachycardia, appropriate rate control is necessary and direct‐current defibrillation is recommended preferentially, versus pharmacological therapy, because of its immediate effect (Figure 17). However, because AF may recur even after successful defibrillation, preventive use of antiarrhythmic agents might be needed in some cases. When combined defibrillation with antiarrhythmic agent and direct‐current shock fail to achieve sinus rhythm recovery, a re‐trial of defibrillation after appropriate therapy for organic heart disease or catheter ablation should be considered.

Safety is the most important issue in the application of pharmacological defibrillation. Therefore, antiarrhythmic agents with negative inotropic effect or QT prolongation can be applied only in cases without organic heart diseases such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease. When pharmacological defibrillation is to be attempted in such cases, highly professional and careful decision making is necessary. In this edition of the guideline, use or limitation of Na+ channel blockers is highlighted and described in relation to the clinical type of AF.

Paroxysmal AF is defined as self‐interrupting AF within 7 days regardless of therapeutic intervention. Artificial defibrillation is recommended within 48 h from the onset of AF for the purpose of removing serious symptoms and/or reduction of risk for systemic embolism. It is known that the efficacy of Na+ channel blockers is higher for AF with shorter duration in cases without organic heart disease; therefore, the use of Na+ channel blocker is recommended for AF within 7 days of onset. However, appropriate antithrombotic strategy should be attempted for defibrillation because the risk for systemic embolism will increase with time. When an immediate effect is required, intravenous administration of an antiarrhythmic agent is more effective. However, there is also an administration method called “pill‐in‐the‐pocket” in which the patients take the drug orally once, depending on their own decision at the time of the AF attack.
531
 Standard antiarrhythmic agents for this purpose are pilsicainide 100 mg,
532
 flecainide 100 mg,
110
,

537
, 
538
, 
539
 and/or sotalol
540

541
 are ineffective for this purpose.

Na+ channel blocker leads to AF interruption by decreasing the activation frequency during AF through conduction delay and/or conduction block in the atrial muscle.
542
 Additional mechanisms, such as prolongation of post‐repolarization refractoriness,
543
, 
544
 increase the radius of the reentrant wave front,
545
, 
546
 and conduction block between the pulmonary veins and left atrium,

 are also considered to relate to AF interruption. These effects are stronger with slow kinetic drugs than the others, resulting in higher efficacy for AF interruption. These drugs also have a negative inotropic effect, but they can be used as first‐line medicine in AF without clinically important organic heart diseases. This point coincides with the American–European guidelines

Various strong Na+ channel blockers are approved for use in Japan. Pilsicainide is a pure Na+ channel blocker developed in Japan. Single oral use of pilsicainide 150 mg interrupted 45% of cases of AF lasting <7 days in the PSTAF trial.
532
 Cibenzoline blocks several K+ channels as well as the Na+ channel,
557
, 
558
 and a single oral dose of cibenzoline 200 mg interrupted 75–85% of AF lasting <48 h.
535
, 
536
 The efficacy of propafenone and flecainide have been widely reported, even in Western countries, with defibrillation rates (intravenous 2 mg/kg/20 min) of 72% and 90%, respectively.
559

There are various class IA antiarrhythmic agents with a K+ channel blocking effect and prolonging effect of the refractory period, such as disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, aprindine and pirmenol, all available in Japan. However, they were not listed as first‐line durgs because clinical use is currently limited. The efficacy of disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine for AF interruption has been verified, but they are not used widely in clinical practice because they have a higher chance of introducing torsade de pointes.

Persistent AF is defined as AF lasting >7 days, regardless of therapeutic intervention, which does not interrupt spontaneously but can be defibrillated by therapeutic intervention. When limited to pharmacological treatment, defibrillation has clinical meaning if targeting QOL improvement or preventing systemic embolism.
509
 However, in cases of persistent AF, it is common to have a long clinical course and organic heart disease as the clinical background, so the risks for systemic embolism and proarrhythmic effect may be high. When considering pharmacological therapy, specific attentions should be paid to the standard antithrombotic strategy and monitoring of side effects.

Continuation of AF promotes progression of atrial remodeling and AF tends to continue longer in the remodeled atria. AF can cause physiological change within tens of minutes and changes in ion channel density within several hours, so that the therapeutic effect may differ in the acute and subacute phases of AF. The level of remodeling can be generally evaluated by left atrial diameter, the duration of AF, fibrillation cycle length, etc.
560
 In a clinical trial of oral pilsicainide 150 mg/day, the defibrillation rate was lower in cases of AF lasting ≥2 weeks and in cases of left atrial diameter ≥45 mm.
561
 Flecainide and sotalol both failed to defibrillate AF in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days.
562

In this guideline, drug selection is described by setting the boundary as 7 days, at which time the effect of Na+ channel blockers becomes weakened. Experimentally, it has been reported that multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and bepridil may show gradual improvement of electrical remodeling (i.e., reverse remodeling).
563
, 
564
, 
565
 Although these drugs are clinically consistent, with interruption of long‐lasting AF after a few weeks,
543
, 
563
 the specific mechanisms have not been clarified.

Defibrillation by oral amiodarone is regarded as the standard treatment in Europe, especially in patients with organic heart disease.
21
 Amiodarone interrupted 23% of AF lasting ≥1 week in the PIAF study,
549
 and 27.1% of AF lasting ≥72 h (vs. placebo 0.8%) in the SAFE‐T study.
550
 Amiodarone is a limited antiarrhythmic agent that can be applied especially in cases of AF and organic heart disease. In this revision of the guideline, it is positioned as an active option for patients without symptomatic tachycardia. However, we should note that insurance coverage for use of amiodarone is limited to cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure in Japan.

There are some Japanese reports on bepridil. Fujiki et al. have reported that 69% of AF lasting ≥3 months could be interrupted.
566
 The J‐BAF study
551
 conducted in Japan demonstrated a 37.5% defibrillation rate by 100 mg/day and 69.0% defibrillation rate by 200 mg/day in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days, but a case of sudden death has been also reported with 200 mg/day of bepridil. Bepridil should be started from 100 mg/day orally, then possibly increased to 200 mg/day. These adjustments should be decided by a specialist under careful monitoring of QT interval and T‐wave morphology.

 AF prevention is not necessary in cases of first‐diagnosed AF without organic heart disease, because the recurrence rate is limited in such cases. AF prevention is indicated in cases of symptomatic recurrent AF that repeats at regular intervals, but AF prevention may also be indicated in patients at a risk of systemic embolism even if they are less symptomatic. In recent years, the efficacy of catheter ablation has dramatically improved,
556
 so it should be included as a considered therapeutic option, especially in cases of symptomatic AF requiring long‐term pharmacological therapy (see “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy for Arrhythmia” (edited 2018) for details of indications for catheter ablation

).

Recommendation and Levels of Evidence for Pharmacological Prevention of AF Recurrence

Even when an antiarrhythmic drug with a highly recommended order is selected, it is necessary to pay close attention to the appearance of negative inotropic effects and proarrhythmic effects during long‐term administration, and to the emergence of extracardiac side effects specific to amiodarone.

Because antiarrhythmic agents affect the ionic currents in the myocardium, they can cause various secondary pathologies such as negative inotropic effects and the development of proarrhythmic effects through QT prolongation due to delayed repolarization. This revision of the guideline follows the concept in the 2013 revised edition
2
 and describes the drugs indicated for cases with and without organic heart disease (hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease). In addition, the conditions that are related to AF such as hypertensproion, dyslipidemia are described as complications (Figure 18).

Flowchart for prevention of AF. *1Anticoagulation therapy might be continued depending on individual risks for embolism and efficacy of AF preventive therapy (see “Chapter V. 3 Anticoagulation Therapy” for details). *2Rate control therapy might be continued in cases of possible AF recurrence and considerable symptoms during AF (see “Chapter V. 4 Rate Control Therapy” for details). *3See the “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy”, 2018 edition 3 for details. *4Hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease. *5Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea syndrome, etc. (see “Chapter V. 2.5 Management of Risk Factors and Comorbidity” for details). *6Appropriate therapeutic intervention for basic and/or complicated diseases (see “Chapter V. 6 Upstream Therapy” for details). *7Insurance coverage for amiodarone is approved in Japan only for patients with AF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Insurance coverage for sotalol is not approved for patients with AF, although the efficacy of sotalol on AF complicated with ischemic heart disease. *8bepridil is reported to be effective for AF with ventricular dysfunction; however there are reports warning of exaggeration of proarrhythmia. AF, atrial fibrillation.

As the background of AF without organic heart disease, systemic pathological conditions such as aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, as well as activity of the autonomic nervous system are involved. AF can be divided into nighttime type (parasympathetic nerve activation type), daytime type (sympathetic nerve activation type), and all‐day type in relation to autonomic nervous system activity. There are studies that evaluated the effects of drugs with M2 receptor blocking action or β‐blocking action in each type of AF, but a universal effect can be expected with strong Na+ channel blockers (Figure 18). There is no evidence for any specific drug (e.g., angiotensin‐receptor blockers), which were once anticipated as upstream therapy, exhibiting an anti‐remodeling effect for AF, but strict control of hypertension or dyslipidemia has been effective in suppressing AF as a control measure for these complicating diseases.

 Therefore, control of complicating diseases is important for controlling AF (Figure 18).

Regarding the long‐term preventive effect of pilsicainide for AF recurrence, it was reported as effective in 53.8% during 12‐month observation for daytime‐type AF.
553
 However, the effect of a Na+ channel blocker is expected to diminish over time, because the target of the blocker (i.e., expression of the Na+ channel itself) will be decreased during continuation of AF. Cibenzoline is more effective than pilsicainide for prevention of AF lasting ≥48 h because it has effects on several K+ channels.
571
 Propafenone, a Na+ channel blocker with a β‐blocking effect, is reported to be more effective than the others for daytime‐type AF.
572
 These findings will help with choosing specific drugs for individual patients.

The effects of flecainide and propafenone have been demonstrated in a Western report.
534
 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Japan also demonstrated that the 1‐month preventive efficacy of flecainide for paroxysmal AF was 39.4% (vs. placebo 3.1%).
573

Regarding the effect of bepridil for AF prevention, Nakazato et al. have reported 18‐month sinus rhythm maintenance in 81% of 86 cases in whom defibrillation succeeded.
548
 Even in comparison with amiodarone, bepridil exhibited a higher AF prevention rate (75%) in comparison with amiodarone (50%) during 14.7 months’ observation.
574
 In contrast, Shiga et al. observed that 23.5% of cases transitioned to permanent AF from paroxysmal AF even under continuation of bepridil therapy, and concluded that its long‐term effect might be limited.
575
 There are some recent reports of the efficacy of pilsicainide or bepridil for cases of AF recurrence after successful catheter ablation. Bepridil has been reported as more effective for cases of remodeled enlarged left atrium. In cases of AF without organic heart disease, bepridil is reported to be effective for Na+ channel blocker refractory AF.
568

It is controversial when pharmacological therapy should be stopped if it is effective for AF prevention. In a study comparing short‐tem (4 weeks) and long‐term (6 months) treatment,
576
 the recurrence rate was higher with short‐term treatment but the difference was only 20%. Considering the cost and risk of long‐term treatment, short‐term treatment may have its own benefit. An observational study that evaluated long‐term treatment (mean 3.4 years) documented cases of death related to pharmacological treatment,
577
 so careless long‐term administration should be avoided. The actual decision for continuation or cessation, as well as the dosing of antiarrhythmic agents, should be performed by considering the individual conditions of AF as well as liver–kidney function (Table 48).

Standard Doses of Representative Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Administration should start with the smaller dose, then can be increased to a higher dose under careful monitoring of side and/or proarrhythmic effects.

Organic heart disease, such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, may influence hemodynamics during AF, resulting in more serious symptoms. Therefore, AF prevention is more important in these cases, but the effects of antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation will be limited because of the progression in atrial remodeling. Negative inotropic action and/or QT prolongation may appear more strongly in these cases. Therefore, upstream therapy (i.e., not only monotherapy but also appropriate therapeutic strategy) for the basic disease becomes important (Figure 18).

The use of renin–angiotensin system blockers (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin‐receptor blocker) was related to a decrease of AF in a the subanalyses of several RCTs,
569
, 
570
, 
578
, 
579
 but the effect of a single intervention, so‐called “upstream therapy”, has been denied.
235
, 
552
, 
580
 These drugs should be used as basic appropriate therapy for heart failure with β‐blockers
581
 as “upstream therapy” in the broad sense.

Because of the presence of organic heart disease, the target of antiarrhythmic agents will change due to changes in the expression of ion channels. Generally, organic heart disease causes atrial fibrosis, which promotes the formation of random reentry within the atria.
555
 Under such conditions, it will be difficult to suppress the many reentries by simple conduction block caused by a Na+ channel blocker. On the other hand, prolongation of the action potential duration caused by a K+ channel blocker can make it difficult to form functional reentry in any part of the atria. Therefore, a K+ channel blocker will be more effective than a Na+ channel blocker in heart failure.
582
 In Japan, amiodarone, sotalol, bepridil and class IA antiarrhythmic agents can be used as K+ channel blockers, but a Na+ channel blocker cannot be used in heart failure, because of the negative inotropic effect.

Japanese insurance coverage for persistent AF is limited for amiodarone in heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or for bepridil. Because there are some reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes during bepridil therapy for AF with organic heart disease,
583
 bepridil is not described as first‐line therapy, but amiodarone and sotalol are listed with comments about limited insurance coverage (Figure 18). Regarding the use of amiodarone for AF with heart failure, the CHF‐STAT study demonstrated the effect for defibrillation and sinus rhythm maintenance.
584
 In that study, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 31% of 51 cases (vs. placebo 8%) and the patients with sinus rhythm exhibited better prognosis than those with AF. However, there may have been a selection bias because the patients in whom defibrillation was successful were assigned to the sinus rhythm group.

In the AF‐CHF study,
508
 an intention‐to‐treat comparison was performed between sinus rhythm and rate control groups. In this study, the sinus rhythm group, which was mainly treated with amiodarone, demonstrated 46–83% of sinus rhythm (vs. 30–41% rate control group) but no difference was observed in prognosis. The study denied the option of maintaining sinus rhythm recovery in drug‐refractory cases, but rhythm control with amiodarone might be an option initially, because the prognosis itself is better with sinus rhythm than with AF.

In the CASTLE‐AF study,
229
 rhythm control and rate control were compared using catheter ablation as the tool for rhythm control in cases of ventricular dysfunction. As a result, the rhythm control group exhibited lower mortality and higher recovery of ventricular dysfunction. Because ablation is more difficult in cases of AF with organic heart disease, the result should be reconfirmed in standardized interventional trials. However, the roles of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for AF prevention must be further investigated together.

### Interruption of AF (Defibrillation)

At the time of AF interruption (defibrillation), great attention must be paid to the possibility of systemic embolism by the pumping out intra‐atrial thrombus. It is important to confirm the absence of intra‐atrial thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography or to perform appropriate anticoagulation therapy, especially in patients in whom the possibility of more than 48‐h continuation of AF cannot be denied. Excepting emergencies, greatest attention must be paid to prevention of systemic embolism.

In the case of emergency in which hemodynamic stability cannot be expected, QRS‐triggered direct‐current defibrillation with ≥100 J electrical shock will be rapid and effective under appropriate anesthesia and respiratory control (Figure 17, Table 45).

In addition to emergency treatment, direct‐current defibrillation should be applied when patients prefer it, when AF is refractory to pharmacological defibrillation, and when use of antiarrhythmic agents is considered more dangerous than direct‐current defibrillation. Especially in cases of AF complicated with organic heart disease such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease, the efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents will be suppressed and the risk of proarrhythmia will be increased. In cases of heart failure, amiodarone might be used for the purpose of defibrillation, but it will take longer to evaluate its efficacy, so its use should be limited to patients in a stable condition. In case of symptomatic tachycardia, appropriate rate control is necessary and direct‐current defibrillation is recommended preferentially, versus pharmacological therapy, because of its immediate effect (Figure 17). However, because AF may recur even after successful defibrillation, preventive use of antiarrhythmic agents might be needed in some cases. When combined defibrillation with antiarrhythmic agent and direct‐current shock fail to achieve sinus rhythm recovery, a re‐trial of defibrillation after appropriate therapy for organic heart disease or catheter ablation should be considered.

Safety is the most important issue in the application of pharmacological defibrillation. Therefore, antiarrhythmic agents with negative inotropic effect or QT prolongation can be applied only in cases without organic heart diseases such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease. When pharmacological defibrillation is to be attempted in such cases, highly professional and careful decision making is necessary. In this edition of the guideline, use or limitation of Na+ channel blockers is highlighted and described in relation to the clinical type of AF.

Paroxysmal AF is defined as self‐interrupting AF within 7 days regardless of therapeutic intervention. Artificial defibrillation is recommended within 48 h from the onset of AF for the purpose of removing serious symptoms and/or reduction of risk for systemic embolism. It is known that the efficacy of Na+ channel blockers is higher for AF with shorter duration in cases without organic heart disease; therefore, the use of Na+ channel blocker is recommended for AF within 7 days of onset. However, appropriate antithrombotic strategy should be attempted for defibrillation because the risk for systemic embolism will increase with time. When an immediate effect is required, intravenous administration of an antiarrhythmic agent is more effective. However, there is also an administration method called “pill‐in‐the‐pocket” in which the patients take the drug orally once, depending on their own decision at the time of the AF attack.

Various strong Na+ channel blockers are approved for use in Japan. Pilsicainide is a pure Na+ channel blocker developed in Japan. Single oral use of pilsicainide 150 mg interrupted 45% of cases of AF lasting <7 days in the PSTAF trial.
532
 Cibenzoline blocks several K+ channels as well as the Na+ channel,
557
, 
558
 and a single oral dose of cibenzoline 200 mg interrupted 75–85% of AF lasting <48 h.
535
, 
536
 The efficacy of propafenone and flecainide have been widely reported, even in Western countries, with defibrillation rates (intravenous 2 mg/kg/20 min) of 72% and 90%, respectively.
559

There are various class IA antiarrhythmic agents with a K+ channel blocking effect and prolonging effect of the refractory period, such as disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine, aprindine and pirmenol, all available in Japan. However, they were not listed as first‐line durgs because clinical use is currently limited. The efficacy of disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine for AF interruption has been verified, but they are not used widely in clinical practice because they have a higher chance of introducing torsade de pointes.

Persistent AF is defined as AF lasting >7 days, regardless of therapeutic intervention, which does not interrupt spontaneously but can be defibrillated by therapeutic intervention. When limited to pharmacological treatment, defibrillation has clinical meaning if targeting QOL improvement or preventing systemic embolism.
509
 However, in cases of persistent AF, it is common to have a long clinical course and organic heart disease as the clinical background, so the risks for systemic embolism and proarrhythmic effect may be high. When considering pharmacological therapy, specific attentions should be paid to the standard antithrombotic strategy and monitoring of side effects.

Continuation of AF promotes progression of atrial remodeling and AF tends to continue longer in the remodeled atria. AF can cause physiological change within tens of minutes and changes in ion channel density within several hours, so that the therapeutic effect may differ in the acute and subacute phases of AF. The level of remodeling can be generally evaluated by left atrial diameter, the duration of AF, fibrillation cycle length, etc.
560
 In a clinical trial of oral pilsicainide 150 mg/day, the defibrillation rate was lower in cases of AF lasting ≥2 weeks and in cases of left atrial diameter ≥45 mm.
561
 Flecainide and sotalol both failed to defibrillate AF in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days.
562

In this guideline, drug selection is described by setting the boundary as 7 days, at which time the effect of Na+ channel blockers becomes weakened. Experimentally, it has been reported that multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and bepridil may show gradual improvement of electrical remodeling (i.e., reverse remodeling).

 the specific mechanisms have not been clarified.

Defibrillation by oral amiodarone is regarded as the standard treatment in Europe, especially in patients with organic heart disease.
21
 Amiodarone interrupted 23% of AF lasting ≥1 week in the PIAF study,
549
 and 27.1% of AF lasting ≥72 h (vs. placebo 0.8%) in the SAFE‐T study.
550
 Amiodarone is a limited antiarrhythmic agent that can be applied especially in cases of AF and organic heart disease. In this revision of the guideline, it is positioned as an active option for patients without symptomatic tachycardia. However, we should note that insurance coverage for use of amiodarone is limited to cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure in Japan.

There are some Japanese reports on bepridil. Fujiki et al. have reported that 69% of AF lasting ≥3 months could be interrupted.
566
 The J‐BAF study
551
 conducted in Japan demonstrated a 37.5% defibrillation rate by 100 mg/day and 69.0% defibrillation rate by 200 mg/day in cases of AF lasting ≥7 days, but a case of sudden death has been also reported with 200 mg/day of bepridil. Bepridil should be started from 100 mg/day orally, then possibly increased to 200 mg/day. These adjustments should be decided by a specialist under careful monitoring of QT interval and T‐wave morphology.

 AF prevention is not necessary in cases of first‐diagnosed AF without organic heart disease, because the recurrence rate is limited in such cases. AF prevention is indicated in cases of symptomatic recurrent AF that repeats at regular intervals, but AF prevention may also be indicated in patients at a risk of systemic embolism even if they are less symptomatic. In recent years, the efficacy of catheter ablation has dramatically improved,
556
 so it should be included as a considered therapeutic option, especially in cases of symptomatic AF requiring long‐term pharmacological therapy (see “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy for Arrhythmia” (edited 2018) for details of indications for catheter ablation

).

Recommendation and Levels of Evidence for Pharmacological Prevention of AF Recurrence

Even when an antiarrhythmic drug with a highly recommended order is selected, it is necessary to pay close attention to the appearance of negative inotropic effects and proarrhythmic effects during long‐term administration, and to the emergence of extracardiac side effects specific to amiodarone.

Because antiarrhythmic agents affect the ionic currents in the myocardium, they can cause various secondary pathologies such as negative inotropic effects and the development of proarrhythmic effects through QT prolongation due to delayed repolarization. This revision of the guideline follows the concept in the 2013 revised edition
2
 and describes the drugs indicated for cases with and without organic heart disease (hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease). In addition, the conditions that are related to AF such as hypertensproion, dyslipidemia are described as complications (Figure 18).

Flowchart for prevention of AF. *1Anticoagulation therapy might be continued depending on individual risks for embolism and efficacy of AF preventive therapy (see “Chapter V. 3 Anticoagulation Therapy” for details). *2Rate control therapy might be continued in cases of possible AF recurrence and considerable symptoms during AF (see “Chapter V. 4 Rate Control Therapy” for details). *3See the “Guidelines for Non‐Pharmacological Therapy”, 2018 edition 3 for details. *4Hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease. *5Hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea syndrome, etc. (see “Chapter V. 2.5 Management of Risk Factors and Comorbidity” for details). *6Appropriate therapeutic intervention for basic and/or complicated diseases (see “Chapter V. 6 Upstream Therapy” for details). *7Insurance coverage for amiodarone is approved in Japan only for patients with AF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. Insurance coverage for sotalol is not approved for patients with AF, although the efficacy of sotalol on AF complicated with ischemic heart disease. *8bepridil is reported to be effective for AF with ventricular dysfunction; however there are reports warning of exaggeration of proarrhythmia. AF, atrial fibrillation.

As the background of AF without organic heart disease, systemic pathological conditions such as aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, as well as activity of the autonomic nervous system are involved. AF can be divided into nighttime type (parasympathetic nerve activation type), daytime type (sympathetic nerve activation type), and all‐day type in relation to autonomic nervous system activity. There are studies that evaluated the effects of drugs with M2 receptor blocking action or β‐blocking action in each type of AF, but a universal effect can be expected with strong Na+ channel blockers (Figure 18). There is no evidence for any specific drug (e.g., angiotensin‐receptor blockers), which were once anticipated as upstream therapy, exhibiting an anti‐remodeling effect for AF, but strict control of hypertension or dyslipidemia has been effective in suppressing AF as a control measure for these complicating diseases.
234
, 
561
 Therefore, control of complicating diseases is important for controlling AF (Figure 18).

Regarding the long‐term preventive effect of pilsicainide for AF recurrence, it was reported as effective in 53.8% during 12‐month observation for daytime‐type AF.

 However, the effect of a Na+ channel blocker is expected to diminish over time, because the target of the blocker (i.e., expression of the Na+ channel itself) will be decreased during continuation of AF. Cibenzoline is more effective than pilsicainide for prevention of AF lasting ≥48 h because it has effects on several K+ channels.
571
 Propafenone, a Na+ channel blocker with a β‐blocking effect, is reported to be more effective than the others for daytime‐type AF.
572
 These findings will help with choosing specific drugs for individual patients.

The effects of flecainide and propafenone have been demonstrated in a Western report.
534
 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Japan also demonstrated that the 1‐month preventive efficacy of flecainide for paroxysmal AF was 39.4% (vs. placebo 3.1%).
573

Regarding the effect of bepridil for AF prevention, Nakazato et al. have reported 18‐month sinus rhythm maintenance in 81% of 86 cases in whom defibrillation succeeded.
548
 Even in comparison with amiodarone, bepridil exhibited a higher AF prevention rate (75%) in comparison with amiodarone (50%) during 14.7 months’ observation.
574
 In contrast, Shiga et al. observed that 23.5% of cases transitioned to permanent AF from paroxysmal AF even under continuation of bepridil therapy, and concluded that its long‐term effect might be limited.
575
 There are some recent reports of the efficacy of pilsicainide or bepridil for cases of AF recurrence after successful catheter ablation. Bepridil has been reported as more effective for cases of remodeled enlarged left atrium. In cases of AF without organic heart disease, bepridil is reported to be effective for Na+ channel blocker refractory AF.
568

It is controversial when pharmacological therapy should be stopped if it is effective for AF prevention. In a study comparing short‐tem (4 weeks) and long‐term (6 months) treatment,
576
 the recurrence rate was higher with short‐term treatment but the difference was only 20%. Considering the cost and risk of long‐term treatment, short‐term treatment may have its own benefit. An observational study that evaluated long‐term treatment (mean 3.4 years) documented cases of death related to pharmacological treatment,
577
 so careless long‐term administration should be avoided. The actual decision for continuation or cessation, as well as the dosing of antiarrhythmic agents, should be performed by considering the individual conditions of AF as well as liver–kidney function (Table 48).

Standard Doses of Representative Antiarrhythmic Drugs

Administration should start with the smaller dose, then can be increased to a higher dose under careful monitoring of side and/or proarrhythmic effects.

Organic heart disease, such as hypertrophic heart, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, may influence hemodynamics during AF, resulting in more serious symptoms. Therefore, AF prevention is more important in these cases, but the effects of antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation will be limited because of the progression in atrial remodeling. Negative inotropic action and/or QT prolongation may appear more strongly in these cases. Therefore, upstream therapy (i.e., not only monotherapy but also appropriate therapeutic strategy) for the basic disease becomes important (Figure 18).

The use of renin–angiotensin system blockers (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin‐receptor blocker) was related to a decrease of AF in a the subanalyses of several RCTs,
569
, 
570
, 
578
, 
579
 but the effect of a single intervention, so‐called “upstream therapy”, has been denied.
235
, 
552
, 
580
 These drugs should be used as basic appropriate therapy for heart failure with β‐blockers
581
 as “upstream therapy” in the broad sense.

Because of the presence of organic heart disease, the target of antiarrhythmic agents will change due to changes in the expression of ion channels. Generally, organic heart disease causes atrial fibrosis, which promotes the formation of random reentry within the atria.
555
 Under such conditions, it will be difficult to suppress the many reentries by simple conduction block caused by a Na+ channel blocker. On the other hand, prolongation of the action potential duration caused by a K+ channel blocker can make it difficult to form functional reentry in any part of the atria. Therefore, a K+ channel blocker will be more effective than a Na+ channel blocker in heart failure.
582
 In Japan, amiodarone, sotalol, bepridil and class IA antiarrhythmic agents can be used as K+ channel blockers, but a Na+ channel blocker cannot be used in heart failure, because of the negative inotropic effect.

Japanese insurance coverage for persistent AF is limited for amiodarone in heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or for bepridil. Because there are some reports of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes during bepridil therapy for AF with organic heart disease,
583
 bepridil is not described as first‐line therapy, but amiodarone and sotalol are listed with comments about limited insurance coverage (Figure 18). Regarding the use of amiodarone for AF with heart failure, the CHF‐STAT study demonstrated the effect for defibrillation and sinus rhythm maintenance.
584
 In that study, sinus rhythm could be maintained in 31% of 51 cases (vs. placebo 8%) and the patients with sinus rhythm exhibited better prognosis than those with AF. However, there may have been a selection bias because the patients in whom defibrillation was successful were assigned to the sinus rhythm group.

In the AF‐CHF study,
508
 an intention‐to‐treat comparison was performed between sinus rhythm and rate control groups. In this study, the sinus rhythm group, which was mainly treated with amiodarone, demonstrated 46–83% of sinus rhythm (vs. 30–41% rate control group) but no difference was observed in prognosis. The study denied the option of maintaining sinus rhythm recovery in drug‐refractory cases, but rhythm control with amiodarone might be an option initially, because the prognosis itself is better with sinus rhythm than with AF.

In the CASTLE‐AF study,
229
 rhythm control and rate control were compared using catheter ablation as the tool for rhythm control in cases of ventricular dysfunction. As a result, the rhythm control group exhibited lower mortality and higher recovery of ventricular dysfunction. Because ablation is more difficult in cases of AF with organic heart disease, the result should be reconfirmed in standardized interventional trials. However, the roles of pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatments for AF prevention must be further investigated together.

### Atrial Fibrillation Without Organic Heart Disease

As the background of AF without organic heart disease, systemic pathological conditions such as aging, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, as well as activity of the autonomic nervous system are involved. AF can be divided into nighttime type (parasympathetic nerve activation type), daytime type (sympathetic nerve activation type), and all‐day type in relation to autonomic nervous system activity. There are studies that evaluated the effects of drugs with M2 receptor blocking action or β‐blocking action in each type of AF, but a universal effect can be expected with strong Na+ channel blockers (Figure 18). There is no evidence for any specific drug (e.g., angiotensin‐receptor blockers), which were once anticipated as upstream therapy, exhibiting an anti‐remodeling effect for AF, but strict control of hypertension or dyslipidemia has been effective in suppressing AF as a control measure for these complicating diseases.
234
, 
561
 Therefore, control of complicating diseases is important for controlling AF (Figure 18).

Regarding the long‐term preventive effect of pilsicainide for AF recurrence, it was reported as effective in 53.8% during 12‐month observation for daytime‐type AF.

### Upstream Therapy

Atrial remodeling (ATR) creates the arrhythmogenic substrate for AF and plays a critical role in the pathophysiology. ATR is characterized by changes in the electrical and structural properties of atrial tissues and cells. These changes are caused by AF‐promoting pathological mediators, including neurohumoral factors (catecholamines, angiotensin II, etc.), growth factors (transforming growth factor‐β, etc.), stretch, inflammation, and oxidative stress. “Upstream therapy” is the pharmacological intervention targeting these upstream pathological mediators that promote AF. Although upstream therapy has been demonstrated to prevent ATR and AF in experimental studies, its efficacy has not been validated in clinical studies. There is thus a gap between the results of experimental and clinical research. Evidence of upstream therapy against AF in comorbid diseases associated with AF is shown in Table 49.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Upstream Therapy for AF Prevention in Underlying Comorbid Diseases

The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated by AF and AF‐associated comorbid diseases, which increases the production of angiotensin II (AT‐II), a pathological mediator for AF. Binding of AT‐II to the receptor in atrial cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts activates profibrotic signaling and promotes fibrotic remodeling. Treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin‐receptor blockers (ARBs) suppresses ATR and AF in animal models of AF.

 in paroxysmal and persistent AF patients who had sinus rhythm restored after pharmacological or electrical cardioversion. In the J‐RHYTHM II trial (the Japanese rhythm management trial II for AF), an open‐label randomized study, treatment with an ARB (candesartan) lowered blood pressure in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF, and also decreased the frequency and symptoms of AF. However, these effects were comparable to the effects of treatment with a Ca2+ channel blocker (CCB, amlodipine); the ARB did not show additional antiarrhythmic effect in AF patients.
234
 In a similar RCT in Asia, treatment with an ARB (telmisartan) did not improve efficacy for secondary prevention of AF in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF when compared with a CCB (nifedipine); however, the percentage of patients who developed AF with a transition from the paroxysmal to persistent form significantly decreased with telmisartan compared with nifedipine, suggesting that ARBs have potential to prevent AF maintenance associated with ATR.
597

In an experimental study, treatment with a mineralocorticoid‐receptor antagonist (MRA) suppressed atrial fibrosis in an animal model of heart failure.

Statins exhibit actions beyond lipid lowering in the prevention of various cardiovascular diseases, including AF, known as “pleiotropic effects”.

Apart from AF, ACEI/ARB, MRA, and β‐blocker have become a practical standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. ACEI/ARB are also commonly used to treat hypertension. These drugs target upstream mediators of AF but their effect on AF prevention has not been validated in clinical practice. Although evidence for the clinical benefit of upstream therapy against AF is still limited, it can be anticipated when these drugs are used as a standard treatment for the comorbid diseases associated with AF.

### Indication and Timing of Non‐Pharmacological Therapy

Atrial fibrillation (AF) progresses from paroxysmal to persistent, leading to dilatation of the left atrium (LA). Catheter ablation (CA) is less effective in the advanced stage, so should be considered before progression of AF.

CA for symptomatic drug‐refractory paroxysmal AF (≥1 class I or III drugs) is recommended in the 2018 JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (Class I; Level of Evidence A, Figure 19, 
4
, Table 50, 
4
). Early CA for drug‐refractory AF is recommended because it is high likely to progress to persistent AF, resulting in LA dilatation. There are 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF.
613
, 
614
, 
615
 Furthermore, a meta‐analysis including these RCTs has been reporrted.
616
 All of these studies showed a significant reduction of AF burden in the CA group, and a low incidence of procedure‐related complications. These results suggest that it is reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal AF.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Catheter Ablation of Symptomatic Drug‐Refractory Paroxysmal AF

Refractory to at least one of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs.

Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; HF, heart failure; LOE, level of evidence; LV, left ventricular; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

(Adapted from JCS and JHRS 2021.3)

Regarding CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, prospective studies showed higher rates of maintenance of sinus rhythm in the CA group compared with the amiodarone group.
617
, 
618
 It is therefore also reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, given that antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective.
4
 There is insufficient evidence to support CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic longstanding AF. Because longstanding persistent AF is accompanied by significant electrical and structural remodeling of the atria, it is difficult to restore and maintain sinus rhythm despite repeated ablation procedures. Factors such as the degree of LA dilatation, patient’s age, symptoms, and patient preference should be taken into account for the indication of CA.
4

Five RCTs comparing the efficacy of CA to medical therapy (rate control) in patients with low cardiac function have been reported to date,
619
, 
620
, 
621
, 
622
, 
623
 and a meta‐analysis including 4 of those studies has been conducted.
624
 According to the analysis, 224 patients, of whom 82.5% had persistent AF, were randomized to CA group or rate control group. AF ablation was associated with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, mean difference 8.5%) compared with rate control. CA was superior in improving quality of life (QOL) and increasing peak oxygen consumption compared with rate control. Major adverse event rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

The AATAC trial was a RCT comparing efficacy of CA for sinus rhythm maintenance to amiodarone over a 2‐year follow‐up. Sinus rhythm maintenance rate was significantly higher in CA group compared with the amiodarone group (70% vs. 34%). CA was superior in improving QOL and reducing unplanned hospitalizations and mortality compared with amiodarone.
625

The CASTLE‐AF trial was a RCT designed to investigate whether CA is associated with better prognosis than medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) in patients with heart failure (HF) and AF. After a 3‐year follow‐up, CA for AF in patients with HF was superior to medical therapy in sinus rhythm maintenance, improving cardiac function and prognosis.
222
 Based on these results, the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018) suggested that CA may improve the prognosis of AF patients with HF, and recommended the same indication (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) in patients with and without HF (reduced left ventricular function).
4

Pacemaker (PM) implantation has been recommended as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic patients with bradycardia–tachycardia syndrome (BTS). However, some patients who have sinus pause only after termination of AF could be treated by CA without PM.
626
, 
627
 The indication should be discussed in detail because of insufficient evidence and lack of RCTs (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).
4

Many AF patients are elderly, and the efficacy and safety of CA for older AF patients have been reported.
628
, 
629
 Therefore it is reasonable that elderly patients (generally ≥75 years old) with preserved ADL (activities of daily living) have the same therapeutic indication as younger patients. However, CA for elderly patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF has a lower recommendation than that for young patients because of insufficient evidence. So far, CA for persistent or longstanding persistent AF has limitations, and patients often require repeat procedure. Furthermore, it is often better to choose medical therapy (rate control) in asymptomatic patients with persistent AF. Therefore it is important to make the decision after informing patients about the risks and benefits of CA.

CA for AF has been limited to symptomatic cases. However, recently it was reported that CA can improve prognosis regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms,
630
 and the prognosis of asymptomatic AF patients was worse than that of symptomatic AF patients.
631
 CA is recommended because it can improve prognosis, even if patients are asymptomatic at the time of AF diagnosis, without deterioration of QOL. Based on this consideration, CA for asymptomatic AF patients was newly introduced in the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018).
74

To date, 4 studies regarding the efficacy and safety of CA for asymptomatic AF have been reported.
632
, 
633
, 
634
, 
635
 Forleo et al reported that the efficacy of CA in asymptomatic AF patients was the same as that in symptomatic patients.
632
 However, Wu et al demonstrated that symptoms got worse in many of the asymptomatic AF patients after CA because of the development of atrial tachycardia.
633
 Meanwhile, improvement in exercise tolerance, B‐type natriuretic peptide level, and QOL after CA have been reported, even when patients were asymptomatic.

 Currently, the indication of CA for asymptomatic AF patients should be discussed in detail because of the lack of RCT evidence. CA for asymptomatic longstanding persistent AF is not recommended because it is too late in the clinical course (repeated recurrence of asymptomatic paroxysmal AF, asymptomatic persistent AF: Class IIb, Level of Evidence C).
4

AV node ablation is recommended for AF patients with medically uncontrollable heart rate, who have severe symptoms of tachycardia or severely reduced heart function or decline of QOL, in cases of unsuccessful or contraindication of CA.
4
 The indication should be discussed for each case, because a permanent pacemaker is needed.

PM implantation is recommended in AF patients with bradycardia‐related symptoms such as faintness and shortness of breath (Class I).
636

### Catheter Ablation for Symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation

CA for symptomatic drug‐refractory paroxysmal AF (≥1 class I or III drugs) is recommended in the 2018 JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (Class I; Level of Evidence A, Figure 19, 
4
, Table 50, 
4
). Early CA for drug‐refractory AF is recommended because it is high likely to progress to persistent AF, resulting in LA dilatation. There are 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF.
613
, 
614
, 
615
 Furthermore, a meta‐analysis including these RCTs has been reporrted.
616
 All of these studies showed a significant reduction of AF burden in the CA group, and a low incidence of procedure‐related complications. These results suggest that it is reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic paroxysmal AF.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Catheter Ablation of Symptomatic Drug‐Refractory Paroxysmal AF

Refractory to at least one of class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs.

(Adapted from JCS and JHRS 2021.3)

Regarding CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, prospective studies showed higher rates of maintenance of sinus rhythm in the CA group compared with the amiodarone group.
617
, 
618
 It is therefore also reasonable to perform CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic persistent AF, given that antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective.
4
 There is insufficient evidence to support CA as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic longstanding AF. Because longstanding persistent AF is accompanied by significant electrical and structural remodeling of the atria, it is difficult to restore and maintain sinus rhythm despite repeated ablation procedures. Factors such as the degree of LA dilatation, patient’s age, symptoms, and patient preference should be taken into account for the indication of CA.

### Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation With Heart Failure (Reduced Left Ventricular Function)

Five RCTs comparing the efficacy of CA to medical therapy (rate control) in patients with low cardiac function have been reported to date,
619
, 
620
, 
621
, 
622
, 
623
 and a meta‐analysis including 4 of those studies has been conducted.
624
 According to the analysis, 224 patients, of whom 82.5% had persistent AF, were randomized to CA group or rate control group. AF ablation was associated with an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, mean difference 8.5%) compared with rate control. CA was superior in improving quality of life (QOL) and increasing peak oxygen consumption compared with rate control. Major adverse event rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

The AATAC trial was a RCT comparing efficacy of CA for sinus rhythm maintenance to amiodarone over a 2‐year follow‐up. Sinus rhythm maintenance rate was significantly higher in CA group compared with the amiodarone group (70% vs. 34%). CA was superior in improving QOL and reducing unplanned hospitalizations and mortality compared with amiodarone.
625

The CASTLE‐AF trial was a RCT designed to investigate whether CA is associated with better prognosis than medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) in patients with heart failure (HF) and AF. After a 3‐year follow‐up, CA for AF in patients with HF was superior to medical therapy in sinus rhythm maintenance, improving cardiac function and prognosis.
222
 Based on these results, the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018) suggested that CA may improve the prognosis of AF patients with HF, and recommended the same indication (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B) in patients with and without HF (reduced left ventricular function).
4

### Catheter Ablation for Bradycardia–Tachycardia Syndrome

Pacemaker (PM) implantation has been recommended as a first‐line therapy for symptomatic patients with bradycardia–tachycardia syndrome (BTS). However, some patients who have sinus pause only after termination of AF could be treated by CA without PM.
626
, 
627
 The indication should be discussed in detail because of insufficient evidence and lack of RCTs (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B).
4

### Catheter Ablation for Elderly Patients

Many AF patients are elderly, and the efficacy and safety of CA for older AF patients have been reported.
628
, 
629
 Therefore it is reasonable that elderly patients (generally ≥75 years old) with preserved ADL (activities of daily living) have the same therapeutic indication as younger patients. However, CA for elderly patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF has a lower recommendation than that for young patients because of insufficient evidence. So far, CA for persistent or longstanding persistent AF has limitations, and patients often require repeat procedure. Furthermore, it is often better to choose medical therapy (rate control) in asymptomatic patients with persistent AF. Therefore it is important to make the decision after informing patients about the risks and benefits of CA.

### Catheter Ablation for Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation

CA for AF has been limited to symptomatic cases. However, recently it was reported that CA can improve prognosis regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms,
630
 and the prognosis of asymptomatic AF patients was worse than that of symptomatic AF patients.
631
 CA is recommended because it can improve prognosis, even if patients are asymptomatic at the time of AF diagnosis, without deterioration of QOL. Based on this consideration, CA for asymptomatic AF patients was newly introduced in the JCS/JHRS “Guideline on Non‐Pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias” (revised in 2018).
74

To date, 4 studies regarding the efficacy and safety of CA for asymptomatic AF have been reported.
632
, 
633
, 
634
, 
635
 Forleo et al reported that the efficacy of CA in asymptomatic AF patients was the same as that in symptomatic patients.
632
 However, Wu et al demonstrated that symptoms got worse in many of the asymptomatic AF patients after CA because of the development of atrial tachycardia.
633
 Meanwhile, improvement in exercise tolerance, B‐type natriuretic peptide level, and QOL after CA have been reported, even when patients were asymptomatic.
634
, 
635
 Currently, the indication of CA for asymptomatic AF patients should be discussed in detail because of the lack of RCT evidence. CA for asymptomatic longstanding persistent AF is not recommended because it is too late in the clinical course (repeated recurrence of asymptomatic paroxysmal AF, asymptomatic persistent AF: Class IIb, Level of Evidence C).
4

### Atrioventricular Node Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation With Uncontrollable Rapid Heart Rate

AV node ablation is recommended for AF patients with medically uncontrollable heart rate, who have severe symptoms of tachycardia or severely reduced heart function or decline of QOL, in cases of unsuccessful or contraindication of CA.
4
 The indication should be discussed for each case, because a permanent pacemaker is needed.

### Pacemaker Implantation for Bradycardic Atrial Fibrillation

PM implantation is recommended in AF patients with bradycardia‐related symptoms such as faintness and shortness of breath (Class I).
636

### ATRIAL FLUTTER / ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) is defined as a fast rhythm from a discrete origin, discharging at a rate that is generally regular, and conducting in a centrifugal manner throughout the atrial tissue. The atrial rate during focal AT is generally between 100 and 250 beats/min. Focal AT represents approximately 3–17% of patients referred for supraventricular tachycardia ablation, and most patients with focal AT are observed to be in the young population.
637
, 
638
 Focal AT in the adult population is usually associated with a benign prognosis; non‐sustained focal AT is common and often does not require treatment, although AT‐induced cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation of incessant supraventricular tachycardia.
639
 Automaticity, triggered activity or micro‐reentry can be considered as the underlying mechanism of focal AT, although methods to distinguish these mechanisms through pharmacological examination or electrophysiological study have modest value because of limited sensitivity and specificity.
640

Focal AT has been localized to the crista terminalis, right or left atrial free wall or appendage, tricuspid or mitral annulus, para‐septal or para‐nodal areas, pulmonary veins, coronary sinus, and coronary cusps on the basis of mapping during electrophysiological studies and successful catheter ablation. Generally, focal AT originates more frequently from the right atrium than from the left atrium.
112
 Algorithms have been developed to evaluate the origin of the focal AT from the P‐wave morphology assessed on a standard 12‐lead ECG. A positive P wave in lead V1 and negative P waves in leads I and aVL are commonly correlated to AT originating from the left atrium, and positive P waves in leads II, III, and aVF indicate that the origin of AT is from the cranial portion of either atria. Shorter P‐wave duration is correlated to AT originating from the para‐septal portion versus the right or left atrial free wall.
639
, 
641

Sinus node reentrant tachycardia involves a micro‐reentrant circuit in the region of the sinoatrial node, and atrial rate during tachycardia is generally 100–150 beats/min. The P‐wave morphology is identical to that of sinus tachycardia. The differential diagnosis of sinus node reentrant tachycardia from sinus tachycardia is the abrupt onset and termination and often a longer RP interval than that observed during normal sinus rhythm, possible induction according to programmed stimulation, and possible demonstration of entrainment.
642

Adenosine‐sensitive atrial reentrant tachycardia also involves a micro‐reentrant circuit in the region of the atrioventricular nodal transitional area, depending on the Ca2+ channel current.
643
 This tachycardia has been localized to the anteroseptal or posteroseptal area, cavotricuspid isthmus and lateral tricuspid annulus on the basis of mapping during electrophysiological studies and successful catheter ablation, and can be terminated by rapid intravenous administration of adenosine triphosphate (2–5 mg). The incidence of left atrial tachycardia following pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation that involves a micro‐reentrant circuit arising from the mitral annulus or transitional area between the pulmonary veins and left atrium is increasing rapidly; a recent report presents approximately 1–6% of the patients referred for atrial tachycardia ablation.
644

The strategy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the acute setting should be performed on the basis of hemodynamics and organic heart disease in patients with AT. The class of recommendation and levels of evidence are presented in Table 51.

 Synchronized electrical cardioversion (with 50–100 J) is considered as a first‐line therapy in AT patients with cardiogenic shock, heart failure and acute myocardial ischemia.
645
, 
646
 RCTs of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for comparative efficacy and safety in patients with AT in the acute setting are not available.
647
, 
648
 In many reports, the response to intravenous antiarrhythmic drug therapy was estimated by electrophysiological study rather than in the clinical environment.

657
 Intravenous adenosine triphosphate and atrial overdrive pacing are usually effective in inhibiting AT with an automatic or a triggered mechanism, and intravenous β‐blockers, non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) and Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are also effective in terminating AT with the abovementioned mechanisms.
640
, 
649
, 
651
 Vagal maneuvers, intravenous β‐blockers, diltiazem and verapamil are effective in terminating AT with a micro‐reentrant mechanism when the micro‐reentrant circuit involves the sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodal area.
104
 However, in case of macro‐reentrant circuit involving working myocardium of the atrium, these drugs are not effective to terminate AT. Intravenous digoxin is not selected for terminating AT because of its slow pharmacokinetics. Although these drugs are relatively safe in hemodynamically stable patients with AT, close monitoring is recommended during intravenous antiarrhythmic drug therapy to evaluate for hypotension, bradycardia or heart failure, especially of patients with childhood and manifest Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Treatment of AT

For example, severe bradycardia following termination of AT, occurrence of bundle block, cardiac dysfunction according to negative inotropic action, past history of atrial flutter.

Abbreviations: AT, atrial tachycardia; COR, class of recommendation; ECG, electrocardiogram; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

On the other hand, out‐of‐hospital self‐administration of antiarrhythmic drugs after the onset of cardiac palpitations, so‐called “pill‐in‐the pocket” therapy, is a favorable approach for AT termination in hemodynamically stable patients with severe subjective symptoms and low frequency.
531
 This approach can not only improve the efficacy of pharmacological AT termination according to subsequent treatment after the onset of cardiac palpitations, but also avoid admission to the emergency room with cardiac palpitations. Oral β‐blockers, verapamil and Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as pilsicainide or cibenzoline are well selected to restore normal sinus rhythm. However, it is necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of antiarrhythmic drugs on the basis of close monitoring on ECG before using this approach. Synchronized electrical cardioversion under intravenous anesthesia and atrial overdrive pacing are recommended in patients with AT refractory to this approach. Table 51 indicatepatiensts the recommendations and level of evidence for the acute treatment of AT.

Catheter ablation is recommended for patients with symptomatic AT, deteriorated quality of life, incessant AT and failed or adverse response to antiarrhythmic drugs.

 are relatively useful in patients with AT, although there is limited evidence regarding their efficacy and safety.

Several studies report moderate efficacy of oral amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm as long‐term treatment in children.
660
, 
661
 Although most reports are in children, limited data suggest similar efficacy in adults.
662
 It is preferable to select oral amiodarone for adult patients with heart failure or failed response to the abovementioned antiarrhythmic drugs.
663
 On the other hand, ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in adult congenital heart disease patients and AT to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.
664
 Recommendations for ongoing management of AT and clinical evidence from observational, prospective studies and meta‐analysis are shown in Table 52.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Ongoing Management of AT

For example: pilsicainide, cibenzoline, propafenone, flecainide.

Abbreviations: AT, atrial tachycardia; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro‐reentrant atrial arrhythmia characterized by a regular atrial rate of 240–440 beats/min and constant P‐wave morphology. AFL is electrocardiographically classified into 2 types: slow cycle length at atrial rates of 240–340 beats/min (type I), and fast cycle length at atrial rates of 340–440 beats/min (type II).
665
 Most of the type I AFL circuits rotating around the tricuspid valve involve the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), and are labeled CTI‐dependent AFL.
666
 When CTI‐dependent AFL involves a circuit that rotates around the tricuspid valve in a counterclockwise direction, it is the so‐called “common type”; less commonly, the CTI‐dependent AFL circuit rotates in a clockwise direction, also known as the “uncommon type”.
667
 Common‐type AFL is characterized electrocardiographically by dominant negative flutter waves in the inferior leads (so‐called “sawtooth waves”) and a positive P wave in lead V1. In contrast, uncommon‐type AFL has the opposite pattern (i.e., positive flutter waves in the inferior leads and wide, negative flutter waves in lead V1). It is common for AF and AFL to coexist in the same patient. Previous studies have reported that 22–82% of patients developing AF underwent CTI ablation within a mean follow‐up of 14–60 months,
668
, 
669
, 
670
, 
671
 and AFL is often observed in patients with AF treated with Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (so‐called “IA or IC flutter”).
672

In contrast, non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL, or uncommon flutter, describes macro‐reentrant ATs that are not dependent on conduction through the CTI.
673
, 
674
 A variety of circuits have been described, including a path around the mitral annulus (perimitral flutter), reentry involving the left atrial roof, and reentry around regions of scarring in the right or left atrium.
675
 Non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL can involve multiple atrial reentry circuits and can often occur in patients with atrial scarring from prior cardiac surgery or ablation, but also may occur in any form of cardiac disease or may be idiopathic. The reentrant circuits are classified as either macro‐reentrant AT (large; often several centimeters or longer in diameter) or micro‐reentrant AT (≤2 cm in diameter), which may be indistinguishable from AT.

 in terminating AFL was comparable or inferior to that of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are intravenously administered to restore sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, intravenous β‐blockers and non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control for AFL.
687

On the other hand, it has been reported in Europe, America and Japan that intravenous amiodarone is effective for terminating AFL.
694
, 
695
 However, intravenous amiodarone should be only administered to patients with AFL and heart failure, or who are refractory to Class I antiarrhythmic drug therapy, because intravenous amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Japan. Synchronized electrical cardioversion under intravenous anesthesia is recommended for patients with AFL refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

Intravenous digoxin is generally selected to achieve favorable rate control for AFL in hemodynamically unstable patients with cardiac dysfunction.
686
 Intravenous β‐blockers (landiolol), diltiazem and verapamil are also effective as favorable rate control drugs for AFL.
512

687
, 
689
 However, avoidance of concomitant diltiazem and verapamil use in patients with pre‐excited AFL, moderate or severe heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, AV block and intraventricular conduction disturbance without implantation of permanent pacemaker is recommended.

According to a randomized control study (J‐LAND study) in Japan, the efficacy and safety of intravenous landiolol has been demonstrated in patients with AFL and cardiac dysfunction.
512
 However, it is reported that the efficacy of intravenous landiolol for achieving favorable rate control in patents with AFL is inferior to that in patients with AF.
515
 In addition, careful management of intravenous landiolol for AFL is required in patients with severe cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <25%) or hemodynamically unstable heart failure (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Ongoing Management of AFL

Class III antiarrhythmic drugs are not covered by the National Health Insurance in Japan.

Abbreviations: AFL, atrial flutter; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is often preferred to long‐term pharmacotherapy for preventing recurrence of AFL, and is considered as a first‐line therapy in patients with CTI‐dependent and non‐CTI‐dependent AFL.
703
, 
709
 For patients in whom ablation is not being considered because of previous unsuccessful procedure or because of patient preference, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is available. The strategy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the ongoing management should be also performed on the basis of hemodynamics and organic heart disease in patients with AFL (Figure 21, Table 55).

In AFL patients with normal or mildly reduced cardiac function, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., bepridil and sotalol)
710
, 
711
 or Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blockers),
704
, 
705
, 
712
 which can prolong the atrial refractory period and delay the conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are considered as first‐line therapy. However, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with AFL are not covered by the NHI in Japan. Although these drugs are relatively safe in hemodynamically stable patients with AFL, close monitoring of the QT interval on ECG is required during oral Class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy to evaluate for torsade de pointes, bradycardia or heart failure.

On the other hand, Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, which can inhibit atrial extrasystoles as triggers and delay conduction velocity in the region of the CTI, are also considered as a first‐line therapy. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are orally administered to maintain sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, concomitant β‐blockers, diltiazem and verapamil use, which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control in AFL patients.
686
 amiodarone is considered as a second‐line therapy in patients with AFL refractory to the abovementioned antiarrhythmic drugs and has demonstrated favorable long‐term efficacy for preventing recurrence of AFL in Europe and the USA.
703
 However, amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the NHI in Japan. In AFL patients with moderately or severely reduced cardiac function, β‐blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy.
706
, 
707
 Careful ongoing management of β‐blockers is especially required to avoid recurrence of heart failure when β‐blockers are initially introduced or are adjusted at an appropriate dosage. Amiodarone without negative inotropic action is considered as a second‐line therapy.
80
 Careful ongoing management of amiodarone is also required to avoid occurrence of extracardiac adverse effects.

Several observational studies of AFL patients undergoing electrical cardioversion to restore sinus nodal rhythm reported short‐term thromboembolic risks ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%,
680
, 
681
 and the thromboembolic rate is significantly higher in patients with AFL lasting ≥48 h than in those with AFL lasting <48 h.
682
 Anticoagulants should be also given to maintain anticoagulation in the therapeutic range for 4 weeks after cardioversion because of transient deterioration of atrial myocardial contraction following cardioversion, so‐called “atrial stunning”, as a mechanism of thromboembolic complications.
708
, 
713
 In previous studies, atrial stunning has been observed for several weeks following not only pharmacological cardioversion but also electrical cardioversion in patients with AFL and AF. Ongoing management with anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) is recommended in patients with AFL to align with recommended anticoagulant therapy for patients with AF. Appropriate anticoagulation therapy should prescribe for 3 weeks before cardioversion and continue at least 4 weeks after cardioversion.
404

According to several prospective studies and a meta‐analysis,
683
, 
684
, 
685
 the long‐term thromboembolic risks in patients with AFL are comparable to those in patients with AF. Multicenter clinical studies of patients undergoing electrical cardioversion demonstrate a short‐term thromboembolic risk ranging from 1.7% to 7% in patients with AFL and AF,
714
 and the thromboembolic rate in patients with sustained AFL is 3% annually.
692
 Other studies have reported similar efficacy of anticoagulation in patients with AFL.
702
 Therefore, on the basis of available data, recommendations for anticoagulant therapy in patients with AFL are similar to those in patients with AF.

### Atrial Tachycardia

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) is defined as a fast rhythm from a discrete origin, discharging at a rate that is generally regular, and conducting in a centrifugal manner throughout the atrial tissue. The atrial rate during focal AT is generally between 100 and 250 beats/min. Focal AT represents approximately 3–17% of patients referred for supraventricular tachycardia ablation, and most patients with focal AT are observed to be in the young population.
637
, 
638
 Focal AT in the adult population is usually associated with a benign prognosis; non‐sustained focal AT is common and often does not require treatment, although AT‐induced cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation of incessant supraventricular tachycardia.
639
 Automaticity, triggered activity or micro‐reentry can be considered as the underlying mechanism of focal AT, although methods to distinguish these mechanisms through pharmacological examination or electrophysiological study have modest value because of limited sensitivity and specificity.
640

Focal AT has been localized to the crista terminalis, right or left atrial free wall or appendage, tricuspid or mitral annulus, para‐septal or para‐nodal areas, pulmonary veins, coronary sinus, and coronary cusps on the basis of mapping during electrophysiological studies and successful catheter ablation. Generally, focal AT originates more frequently from the right atrium than from the left atrium.
112
 Algorithms have been developed to evaluate the origin of the focal AT from the P‐wave morphology assessed on a standard 12‐lead ECG. A positive P wave in lead V1 and negative P waves in leads I and aVL are commonly correlated to AT originating from the left atrium, and positive P waves in leads II, III, and aVF indicate that the origin of AT is from the cranial portion of either atria. Shorter P‐wave duration is correlated to AT originating from the para‐septal portion versus the right or left atrial free wall.
639
, 
641

Sinus node reentrant tachycardia involves a micro‐reentrant circuit in the region of the sinoatrial node, and atrial rate during tachycardia is generally 100–150 beats/min. The P‐wave morphology is identical to that of sinus tachycardia. The differential diagnosis of sinus node reentrant tachycardia from sinus tachycardia is the abrupt onset and termination and often a longer RP interval than that observed during normal sinus rhythm, possible induction according to programmed stimulation, and possible demonstration of entrainment.
642

Adenosine‐sensitive atrial reentrant tachycardia also involves a micro‐reentrant circuit in the region of the atrioventricular nodal transitional area, depending on the Ca2+ channel current.
643
 This tachycardia has been localized to the anteroseptal or posteroseptal area, cavotricuspid isthmus and lateral tricuspid annulus on the basis of mapping during electrophysiological studies and successful catheter ablation, and can be terminated by rapid intravenous administration of adenosine triphosphate (2–5 mg). The incidence of left atrial tachycardia following pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation that involves a micro‐reentrant circuit arising from the mitral annulus or transitional area between the pulmonary veins and left atrium is increasing rapidly; a recent report presents approximately 1–6% of the patients referred for atrial tachycardia ablation.
644

The strategy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the acute setting should be performed on the basis of hemodynamics and organic heart disease in patients with AT. The class of recommendation and levels of evidence are presented in Table 51.

 Intravenous adenosine triphosphate and atrial overdrive pacing are usually effective in inhibiting AT with an automatic or a triggered mechanism, and intravenous β‐blockers, non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) and Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are also effective in terminating AT with the abovementioned mechanisms.
640
, 
649
, 
651
 Vagal maneuvers, intravenous β‐blockers, diltiazem and verapamil are effective in terminating AT with a micro‐reentrant mechanism when the micro‐reentrant circuit involves the sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodal area.
104
 However, in case of macro‐reentrant circuit involving working myocardium of the atrium, these drugs are not effective to terminate AT. Intravenous digoxin is not selected for terminating AT because of its slow pharmacokinetics. Although these drugs are relatively safe in hemodynamically stable patients with AT, close monitoring is recommended during intravenous antiarrhythmic drug therapy to evaluate for hypotension, bradycardia or heart failure, especially of patients with childhood and manifest Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Treatment of AT

For example, severe bradycardia following termination of AT, occurrence of bundle block, cardiac dysfunction according to negative inotropic action, past history of atrial flutter.

Abbreviations: AT, atrial tachycardia; COR, class of recommendation; ECG, electrocardiogram; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

On the other hand, out‐of‐hospital self‐administration of antiarrhythmic drugs after the onset of cardiac palpitations, so‐called “pill‐in‐the pocket” therapy, is a favorable approach for AT termination in hemodynamically stable patients with severe subjective symptoms and low frequency.
531
 This approach can not only improve the efficacy of pharmacological AT termination according to subsequent treatment after the onset of cardiac palpitations, but also avoid admission to the emergency room with cardiac palpitations. Oral β‐blockers, verapamil and Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as pilsicainide or cibenzoline are well selected to restore normal sinus rhythm. However, it is necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of antiarrhythmic drugs on the basis of close monitoring on ECG before using this approach. Synchronized electrical cardioversion under intravenous anesthesia and atrial overdrive pacing are recommended in patients with AT refractory to this approach. Table 51 indicatepatiensts the recommendations and level of evidence for the acute treatment of AT.

 On the other hand, ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in adult congenital heart disease patients and AT to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.

 Recommendations for ongoing management of AT and clinical evidence from observational, prospective studies and meta‐analysis are shown in Table 52.

### Atrial Flutter

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro‐reentrant atrial arrhythmia characterized by a regular atrial rate of 240–440 beats/min and constant P‐wave morphology. AFL is electrocardiographically classified into 2 types: slow cycle length at atrial rates of 240–340 beats/min (type I), and fast cycle length at atrial rates of 340–440 beats/min (type II).
665
 Most of the type I AFL circuits rotating around the tricuspid valve involve the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), and are labeled CTI‐dependent AFL.
666
 When CTI‐dependent AFL involves a circuit that rotates around the tricuspid valve in a counterclockwise direction, it is the so‐called “common type”; less commonly, the CTI‐dependent AFL circuit rotates in a clockwise direction, also known as the “uncommon type”.
667
 Common‐type AFL is characterized electrocardiographically by dominant negative flutter waves in the inferior leads (so‐called “sawtooth waves”) and a positive P wave in lead V1. In contrast, uncommon‐type AFL has the opposite pattern (i.e., positive flutter waves in the inferior leads and wide, negative flutter waves in lead V1). It is common for AF and AFL to coexist in the same patient. Previous studies have reported that 22–82% of patients developing AF underwent CTI ablation within a mean follow‐up of 14–60 months,
668
, 
669
, 
670
, 
671
 and AFL is often observed in patients with AF treated with Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (so‐called “IA or IC flutter”).
672

In contrast, non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL, or uncommon flutter, describes macro‐reentrant ATs that are not dependent on conduction through the CTI.
673
, 
674
 A variety of circuits have been described, including a path around the mitral annulus (perimitral flutter), reentry involving the left atrial roof, and reentry around regions of scarring in the right or left atrium.
675
 Non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL can involve multiple atrial reentry circuits and can often occur in patients with atrial scarring from prior cardiac surgery or ablation, but also may occur in any form of cardiac disease or may be idiopathic. The reentrant circuits are classified as either macro‐reentrant AT (large; often several centimeters or longer in diameter) or micro‐reentrant AT (≤2 cm in diameter), which may be indistinguishable from AT.

 in terminating AFL was comparable or inferior to that of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are intravenously administered to restore sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, intravenous β‐blockers and non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control for AFL.
687

On the other hand, it has been reported in Europe, America and Japan that intravenous amiodarone is effective for terminating AFL.
694
, 
695
 However, intravenous amiodarone should be only administered to patients with AFL and heart failure, or who are refractory to Class I antiarrhythmic drug therapy, because intravenous amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Japan. Synchronized electrical cardioversion under intravenous anesthesia is recommended for patients with AFL refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

Intravenous digoxin is generally selected to achieve favorable rate control for AFL in hemodynamically unstable patients with cardiac dysfunction.

 However, avoidance of concomitant diltiazem and verapamil use in patients with pre‐excited AFL, moderate or severe heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, AV block and intraventricular conduction disturbance without implantation of permanent pacemaker is recommended.

According to a randomized control study (J‐LAND study) in Japan, the efficacy and safety of intravenous landiolol has been demonstrated in patients with AFL and cardiac dysfunction.
512
 However, it is reported that the efficacy of intravenous landiolol for achieving favorable rate control in patents with AFL is inferior to that in patients with AF.
515
 In addition, careful management of intravenous landiolol for AFL is required in patients with severe cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <25%) or hemodynamically unstable heart failure (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Ongoing Management of AFL

Class III antiarrhythmic drugs are not covered by the National Health Insurance in Japan.

Abbreviations: AFL, atrial flutter; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is often preferred to long‐term pharmacotherapy for preventing recurrence of AFL, and is considered as a first‐line therapy in patients with CTI‐dependent and non‐CTI‐dependent AFL.
703
, 
709
 For patients in whom ablation is not being considered because of previous unsuccessful procedure or because of patient preference, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is available. The strategy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the ongoing management should be also performed on the basis of hemodynamics and organic heart disease in patients with AFL (Figure 21, Table 55).

In AFL patients with normal or mildly reduced cardiac function, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., bepridil and sotalol)
710
, 
711
 or Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blockers),
704
, 
705
, 
712
 which can prolong the atrial refractory period and delay the conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are considered as first‐line therapy. However, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with AFL are not covered by the NHI in Japan. Although these drugs are relatively safe in hemodynamically stable patients with AFL, close monitoring of the QT interval on ECG is required during oral Class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy to evaluate for torsade de pointes, bradycardia or heart failure.

On the other hand, Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, which can inhibit atrial extrasystoles as triggers and delay conduction velocity in the region of the CTI, are also considered as a first‐line therapy. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are orally administered to maintain sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, concomitant β‐blockers, diltiazem and verapamil use, which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control in AFL patients.
686
 amiodarone is considered as a second‐line therapy in patients with AFL refractory to the abovementioned antiarrhythmic drugs and has demonstrated favorable long‐term efficacy for preventing recurrence of AFL in Europe and the USA.
703
 However, amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the NHI in Japan. In AFL patients with moderately or severely reduced cardiac function, β‐blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy.
706
, 
707
 Careful ongoing management of β‐blockers is especially required to avoid recurrence of heart failure when β‐blockers are initially introduced or are adjusted at an appropriate dosage. Amiodarone without negative inotropic action is considered as a second‐line therapy.
80
 Careful ongoing management of amiodarone is also required to avoid occurrence of extracardiac adverse effects.

Several observational studies of AFL patients undergoing electrical cardioversion to restore sinus nodal rhythm reported short‐term thromboembolic risks ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%,
680
, 
681
 and the thromboembolic rate is significantly higher in patients with AFL lasting ≥48 h than in those with AFL lasting <48 h.
682
 Anticoagulants should be also given to maintain anticoagulation in the therapeutic range for 4 weeks after cardioversion because of transient deterioration of atrial myocardial contraction following cardioversion, so‐called “atrial stunning”, as a mechanism of thromboembolic complications.
708
, 
713
 In previous studies, atrial stunning has been observed for several weeks following not only pharmacological cardioversion but also electrical cardioversion in patients with AFL and AF. Ongoing management with anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) is recommended in patients with AFL to align with recommended anticoagulant therapy for patients with AF. Appropriate anticoagulation therapy should prescribe for 3 weeks before cardioversion and continue at least 4 weeks after cardioversion.
404

According to several prospective studies and a meta‐analysis,
683
, 
684
, 
685
 the long‐term thromboembolic risks in patients with AFL are comparable to those in patients with AF. Multicenter clinical studies of patients undergoing electrical cardioversion demonstrate a short‐term thromboembolic risk ranging from 1.7% to 7% in patients with AFL and AF,
714
 and the thromboembolic rate in patients with sustained AFL is 3% annually.
692
 Other studies have reported similar efficacy of anticoagulation in patients with AFL.
702
 Therefore, on the basis of available data, recommendations for anticoagulant therapy in patients with AFL are similar to those in patients with AF.

### Pathophysiology

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro‐reentrant atrial arrhythmia characterized by a regular atrial rate of 240–440 beats/min and constant P‐wave morphology. AFL is electrocardiographically classified into 2 types: slow cycle length at atrial rates of 240–340 beats/min (type I), and fast cycle length at atrial rates of 340–440 beats/min (type II).
665
 Most of the type I AFL circuits rotating around the tricuspid valve involve the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI), and are labeled CTI‐dependent AFL.
666
 When CTI‐dependent AFL involves a circuit that rotates around the tricuspid valve in a counterclockwise direction, it is the so‐called “common type”; less commonly, the CTI‐dependent AFL circuit rotates in a clockwise direction, also known as the “uncommon type”.
667
 Common‐type AFL is characterized electrocardiographically by dominant negative flutter waves in the inferior leads (so‐called “sawtooth waves”) and a positive P wave in lead V1. In contrast, uncommon‐type AFL has the opposite pattern (i.e., positive flutter waves in the inferior leads and wide, negative flutter waves in lead V1). It is common for AF and AFL to coexist in the same patient. Previous studies have reported that 22–82% of patients developing AF underwent CTI ablation within a mean follow‐up of 14–60 months,
668
, 
669
, 
670
, 
671
 and AFL is often observed in patients with AF treated with Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (so‐called “IA or IC flutter”).
672

In contrast, non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL, or uncommon flutter, describes macro‐reentrant ATs that are not dependent on conduction through the CTI.
673
, 
674
 A variety of circuits have been described, including a path around the mitral annulus (perimitral flutter), reentry involving the left atrial roof, and reentry around regions of scarring in the right or left atrium.
675
 Non‐isthmus‐dependent AFL can involve multiple atrial reentry circuits and can often occur in patients with atrial scarring from prior cardiac surgery or ablation, but also may occur in any form of cardiac disease or may be idiopathic. The reentrant circuits are classified as either macro‐reentrant AT (large; often several centimeters or longer in diameter) or micro‐reentrant AT (≤2 cm in diameter), which may be indistinguishable from AT.

 In previous studies, the efficacy of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as intravenous disopyramide,
688
 oral propafenone,
689
 intravenous procainamide
690
 and intravenous flecainide
691
 in terminating AFL was comparable or inferior to that of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are intravenously administered to restore sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, intravenous β‐blockers and non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control for AFL.
687

On the other hand, it has been reported in Europe, America and Japan that intravenous amiodarone is effective for terminating AFL.
694
, 
695
 However, intravenous amiodarone should be only administered to patients with AFL and heart failure, or who are refractory to Class I antiarrhythmic drug therapy, because intravenous amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Japan. Synchronized electrical cardioversion under intravenous anesthesia is recommended for patients with AFL refractory to antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

Intravenous digoxin is generally selected to achieve favorable rate control for AFL in hemodynamically unstable patients with cardiac dysfunction.
686
 Intravenous β‐blockers (landiolol), diltiazem and verapamil are also effective as favorable rate control drugs for AFL.
512
, 
687
, 
689
 However, avoidance of concomitant diltiazem and verapamil use in patients with pre‐excited AFL, moderate or severe heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, AV block and intraventricular conduction disturbance without implantation of permanent pacemaker is recommended.

According to a randomized control study (J‐LAND study) in Japan, the efficacy and safety of intravenous landiolol has been demonstrated in patients with AFL and cardiac dysfunction.
512
 However, it is reported that the efficacy of intravenous landiolol for achieving favorable rate control in patents with AFL is inferior to that in patients with AF.
515
 In addition, careful management of intravenous landiolol for AFL is required in patients with severe cardiac dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <25%) or hemodynamically unstable heart failure (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Ongoing Management of AFL

Class III antiarrhythmic drugs are not covered by the National Health Insurance in Japan.

Abbreviations: AFL, atrial flutter; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is often preferred to long‐term pharmacotherapy for preventing recurrence of AFL, and is considered as a first‐line therapy in patients with CTI‐dependent and non‐CTI‐dependent AFL.
703
, 
709
 For patients in whom ablation is not being considered because of previous unsuccessful procedure or because of patient preference, antiarrhythmic drug therapy is available. The strategy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in the ongoing management should be also performed on the basis of hemodynamics and organic heart disease in patients with AFL (Figure 21, Table 55).

In AFL patients with normal or mildly reduced cardiac function, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., bepridil and sotalol)
710
, 
711
 or Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blockers),
704
, 
705
, 
712
 which can prolong the atrial refractory period and delay the conduction velocity in the AV node through a direct pharmacological effect, are considered as first‐line therapy. However, Class III antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with AFL are not covered by the NHI in Japan. Although these drugs are relatively safe in hemodynamically stable patients with AFL, close monitoring of the QT interval on ECG is required during oral Class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy to evaluate for torsade de pointes, bradycardia or heart failure.

On the other hand, Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, which can inhibit atrial extrasystoles as triggers and delay conduction velocity in the region of the CTI, are also considered as a first‐line therapy. When Class I antiarrhythmic drugs with anticholinergic action, which may lead to a rapid 1 : 1 ventricular response, are orally administered to maintain sinus nodal rhythm in patients with AFL, concomitant β‐blockers, diltiazem and verapamil use, which can delay conduction velocity in the AV node, are preferable to achieve favorable rate control in AFL patients.
686
 amiodarone is considered as a second‐line therapy in patients with AFL refractory to the abovementioned antiarrhythmic drugs and has demonstrated favorable long‐term efficacy for preventing recurrence of AFL in Europe and the USA.
703
 However, amiodarone in patients with AFL is not covered by the NHI in Japan. In AFL patients with moderately or severely reduced cardiac function, β‐blockers are recommended as a first‐line therapy.
706
, 
707
 Careful ongoing management of β‐blockers is especially required to avoid recurrence of heart failure when β‐blockers are initially introduced or are adjusted at an appropriate dosage. Amiodarone without negative inotropic action is considered as a second‐line therapy.
80
 Careful ongoing management of amiodarone is also required to avoid occurrence of extracardiac adverse effects.

### Recommendations for Anticoagulant Therapy of Atrial Flutter

Several observational studies of AFL patients undergoing electrical cardioversion to restore sinus nodal rhythm reported short‐term thromboembolic risks ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%,
680
, 
681
 and the thromboembolic rate is significantly higher in patients with AFL lasting ≥48 h than in those with AFL lasting <48 h.
682
 Anticoagulants should be also given to maintain anticoagulation in the therapeutic range for 4 weeks after cardioversion because of transient deterioration of atrial myocardial contraction following cardioversion, so‐called “atrial stunning”, as a mechanism of thromboembolic complications.
708
, 
713
 In previous studies, atrial stunning has been observed for several weeks following not only pharmacological cardioversion but also electrical cardioversion in patients with AFL and AF. Ongoing management with anticoagulant therapy (warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants) is recommended in patients with AFL to align with recommended anticoagulant therapy for patients with AF. Appropriate anticoagulation therapy should prescribe for 3 weeks before cardioversion and continue at least 4 weeks after cardioversion.
404

According to several prospective studies and a meta‐analysis,
683
, 
684
, 
685
 the long‐term thromboembolic risks in patients with AFL are comparable to those in patients with AF. Multicenter clinical studies of patients undergoing electrical cardioversion demonstrate a short‐term thromboembolic risk ranging from 1.7% to 7% in patients with AFL and AF,
714
 and the thromboembolic rate in patients with sustained AFL is 3% annually.
692
 Other studies have reported similar efficacy of anticoagulation in patients with AFL.
702
 Therefore, on the basis of available data, recommendations for anticoagulant therapy in patients with AFL are similar to those in patients with AF.

### VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as tachycardia originating below the bifurcation of the His bundle. Sustained VT is defined as continuing for at least 30 s or requiring intervention. VT for <30 s is called non‐sustained VT. VT is divided into that occurring in the heart with structural heart disease, and idiopathic VT with no apparent heart disease. The most common forms of idiopathic VT are fascicular left ventricular VT (LF‐VT) and VT originating in the outflow tract (OT‐VT).

The organic heart diseases in VT with structural heart disease include myocardial infarction (MI), dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, and post‐cardiac surgery.
715
 In Europe and North America, the most common underlying disease is old MI. However, in Japan, the rate of cardiomyopathy is relatively high.
1
 Sustained VT is a major cause of syncope and sudden death due to arrhythmia. The risk of sudden death increases in patients with reduced cardiac function because of the underlying disease.

Regarding idiopathic VT, LF‐VT is often reported in Asia, including Japan.
716
, 
717
 Both LF‐VT and OT‐VT are likely to occur with physical exercise or mental excitation. In general, idiopathic VT has a better prognosis than VT with structural heart disease.

Most cases of VT with structural heart disease are caused by reentry, dependent on the scar tissue associated with the organic heart disease.
718
 Cardiomyocytes are surrounded by fibrous tissue in the scar area, which causes conduction disturbance and formation of a reentry circuit.
719
, 
720
 Infiltration of adipocytes also contributes to the formation of reentry circuits.
721
 Sustained VT with structural heart disease typically presents as a monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia, and is often evoked and terminated by programmed stimulation.

Idiopathic LF‐VT is caused by abnormal Purkinje fibers in part of the reentry circuit.
722
, 
723
, 
724
 Because it is known that abnormal Purkinje fibers have decremental conduction properties and verapamil sensitivity, LF‐VT is also called verapamil‐sensitive VT.
725
 A bundle branch reentry is considered another type of VT originating from the bundle branch and Purkinje fibers.
726
 These VTs have an anatomically fixed reentry circuit and can be diagnosed as reentry by electrophysiological study.

The focus of OT‐VT is distributed through the left and right ventricular OTs, the left ventricular epicardium, the cusp of the aortic valve, the pulmonary artery, and the basal septum, although the most frequent focus is in the right OT.
727
, 
728
, 
729
 Most cases of OT‐VT are catecholamine‐dependent, and present with multiple monomorphic premature ventricular contractions and recurrent non‐sustained VT. It has been reported that OT‐VT is caused by abnormal automaticity or triggered activity.
730
, 
731

Idiopathic VT is defined as the VT without any apparent structural heart diseases, diagnosed by physical examination, 12‐lead ECG, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with idiopathic VT generally have a preferable prognosis, and the indication of pharmacological therapy based on the patient’s preference, symptoms etc. The tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy is a reversible myocardial dysfunction due to frequent extrasystoles or tachycardia. Therapeutic options should be considered in this form of cardiomyopathy even without symptoms of tachycardia.
732

The origin and the mechanism of VT can be predicted by the QRS morphology during VT in typical idiopathic VT (Figure 22). The mode of onset (during activity or rest), ambulatory ECG recording and exercise ECG are helpful for the decision of antiarrhythmic drugs (Figure 23, Table 56).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Treatment of Idiopathic VT

COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

The origin of idiopathic VT is predominantly in the area of the right ventricular OT, left ventricular OT, aortic sinus, tricuspid annulus, mitral annulus, and papillary muscle.
733
 The most frequent form of 12‐lead ECG during VT shows left bundle branch block morphology and right deviation (inferior axis), which originates from the OT (Figure 22A). The mechanism of this form of VT is mainly abnormal automaticity or triggered activity, and OT‐VT usually shows a non‐sustained and repetitive form. The mechanism of triggered activity is delayed afterdepolarization, which is responsible for the Ca2+ channel current. Antiarrhythmic drugs that inhibit the Ca2+ channel current, such as β‐blockers or non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers, may be effective for OT‐VT. These drugs are administered by bolus injection to terminate VT, and then orally to prevent recurrence. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blocker), such as propafenone, are an alternative choice if patients do not have reduced cardiac and renal function.

76

734

, 
736

VT with right bundle branch block and left deviation (superior axis) is idiopathic reentrant VT (idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia; ILVT), related to the Purkinje network around the left bundle branch (Figure 22B). This VT is characterized as verapamil‐sensitive. Verapamil is effective for terminating and preventing this VT. Intravenous injection of 5 mg of verapamil usually terminates VT. Higher doses (>5 mg) of verapamil are sometime required to terminate VT if it has been sustained for a long time and the intrinsic adrenergic activity is high. The other form of idiopathic VT, such as papillary muscle VT, should be considered in the case of verapamil non‐sensitive VT.
723

β‐blockade is effective at inhibiting papillary muscle VT. There is no specific pharmacological approach for the other forms of idiopathic VT. β‐blocker or Class I antiarrhythmic drug is empirically administered.

Avoidance of aggravating factors, such as excessive consumption of caffeine, smoking and alcohol, may be sufficient for mild symptoms.
737
 Catheter ablation can be a highly effective treatment with high acute success rate and low recurrence rate during long‐term follow‐up.
4
, 
76
, 
737
 If catheter ablation fails or is not applicable, pharmacological therapy should be considered.

VT can occur in patients with organic heart disease such as MI, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, post‐myocarditis, and congenital heart diseases, including Fallot’s tetralogy. In those cases, cardiac function is mostly deteriorated by the cardiac disease, and tachycardic attacks are more likely to occur in patients with more severe deterioration. It is very common for those patients to become hemodynamically unstable at the time of the VT attacks, and the first treatment is to terminate the tachycardia. Table 57 shows treatment of recommendations and levels of evidence for VT associated with organic heart disease.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Therapy for VT Associated With Organic Heart Disease

Indication of catheter ablation is the same as in the “Guideline for Non‐pharmacotherapy of Cardiac Arrhythmias”.

Sustained VT associated with organic heart disease has different ECG findings depending on whether it is monomorphic or polymorphic (Figure 24).
738
 If the patient is hemodynamically unstable with VT, perform direct‐current defibrillation according to the procedure of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and consider intravenous administration of amiodarone or nifekalant as an antiarrhythmic drug (Figure 25).
739
, 
740
, 
741
, 
742
 When these drugs are ineffective or unavailable, consider intravenous lidocaine as an alternative.
739
, 
743
 Emergency catheter ablation may be indicated for frequent recurrent monomorphic VT and non‐sustained VT. Because reentry is usually the main mechanism of sustained VT, pacing stimulation from the ventricle can be used to terminate it in many cases.

Drug selection for the purpose of termination and prevention of sustained VT associated with organic heart disease. *1In the cases of sustaining hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, the drug should be administered where immediate direct current defibrillation can be performed. *2Alternative drug when no other antiarrhythmic drug is available. *3The drug should be used only for the monomorphic sustained VT. *4The drug should be initiate from low dose and gradually increase for sustained VT. VT, ventricular tachycardia.

In patients with frequent VT after implantation of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD), intravenous administration of an antiarrhythmic drug, such as nifekalant in Japan,
744
 may be performed when using sedation and anesthesia is being considered.

If the status is hemodynamically stable, drug treatment can be considered after 12‐lead ECG recording and careful observation of hemodynamics. At the same time, proceed with a detailed evaluation of the organic heart disease from physical and laboratory findings. When an antiarrhythmic drug is intravenously administered with ECG monitoring, attention should be paid to blood pressure, bradycardia, and QRS width prolongation until the tachycardia terminates. Always keep in mind the possibility of sudden changes, and apply direct‐current defibrillation immediately the hemodynamics deteriorate due to drug administration, etc.

Intravenous administration of amiodarone, nifekalant, or procainamide is considered a first‐line drug therapy.
745
, 
746
, 
747
, 
748
, 
749
 If the tachycardia is stable monomorphic sustained VT, intravenous procainamide should be administered preferentially.
745
, 
746
, 
747
, 
748
 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in other countries, meta‐analyses, and retrospective studies in Japan have shown that procainamide is significantly superior to lidocaine in terminating monomorphic VT.
745
, 
746
, 
747
 In addition, procainamide is superior to amiodarone, both for terminating tachycardia and less adverse events, according to the RCTs, which targeted approximately 80% of cases of VT related to organic heart disease with cardiac dysfunction.
748
 Another study reported that amiodarone was significantly superior to lidocaine in terminating tachycardia and 1‐day survival.
749
 On the other hand, another retrospective study has reported that amiodarone had limited acute effect on terminating VT in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cardiac dysfunction,
750
 which suggests the acute effect of terminating VT by amiodarone is not been well established. With nifekalant, VT was terminated in 52.8% of the Japanese study patients.
744
 Although lidocaine is not recommended for monomorphic VT,
745
, 
746
, 
747
, 
749
, 
751
 it may be selected as an alternative drug when amiodarone, nifekalant, and procainamide cannot be used or the patient is in the acute phase of MI.
752
 Intravenous drip infusion of landiolol, a very short‐acting β
1‐blocker, is recommended for recurrent VT associated with organic heart disease in which antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, and nifekalant are ineffective.
753
, 
754
 It should be intravenously administered with gradually increasing dose while monitoring hemodynamics and ECG. Intravenous administration of sotalol, which is not available in Japan, has been shown to be significantly superior to terminating tachycardia compared with lidocaine.
745
, 
751

Prevention of VT associated with organic heart disease is classified into primary prevention to prevent the onset of symptoms, and secondary prevention to prevent recurrence of attacks. As sustained VT is directly related to prognosis, positive consideration to preventing it should be given. First, fully evaluate whether there is any possibility that VT is associated with reversible factors such as ischemia, electrolyte abnormality, and drugs. When myocardial ischemia causes tachycardia, coronary revascularization is strongly considered. When drug administration is tried to prevent tachycardia, the drug with fewest side effects should be selected because of the need for long‐term administration.

Implantation of an ICD is the first choice for preventing recurrent hemodynamically unstable VT.
755
, 
756
, 
757

Even if VT is hemodynamically stable, unstable VT can occasionally occur later in patients with organic heart disease such as IHD with cardiac dysfunction. An ICD is recommended in such cases for preventing poor prognosis.
758
, 
759
 Drug therapy is used when an ICD cannot be implanted or when it reduces the occurrence of VT in an ICD‐implanted patient. Whether or not an antiarrhythmic drug is used for an ICD‐implanted patient depends on the case and the facility’s policy. Drugs that can terminate VT do not always have the effect of preventing recurrence.

Amiodarone and sotalol are mainly used to prevent recurrence of VT.
84
, 
760
, 
761
 Bepridil or β‐blocker may be used in some cases. Generally, amiodarone is used without evaluating drug effect by electrophysiological study.
755
 No one knows if drug selection based on electrophysiological study prevents recurrence of VT.
762
 According to a Japanese trial, amiodarone administration (150 or 200 mg/day) based on electrophysiological study was effective in preventing tachycardia in patients with relatively preserved cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 30–50%).
763
 On the other hand, it did not work in the patients with LVEF <30%.
763
 A multicenter RCT clarified that sotalol significantly reduces both mortality and the need for ICD operation.
764
 In addition, it has been reported that the combination of amiodarone and β‐blocker significantly reduced the need for ICD operation compared with administration of β‐blocker or sotalol alone.
84

Electrical storm (ES) patients should be managed in hospital. Amiodarone or nifekalant is generally used to suppress the recurrence of arrhythmias, and a combination of amiodarone with propranolol significantly suppresses the occurrence of events compared with amiodarone plus metoprolol.
765
 In cases where these drugs are ineffective, Na+ channel blockers can be used while checking their effectiveness. Cather ablation is recommended when arrhythmia control is difficult even with the abovementioned drugs.
766
, 
767
, 
768
 At this time, do not forget the use of pharmacotherapy to prevent deterioration of the organic heart disease.

Holter‐ECG monitoring in out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest and sudden death, and the effectiveness of ICDs in primary prevention of sudden death clarify that VT is closely associated with sudden death. However, the prognostic effect of ICDs in primary prevention varies according to the type of organic heart disease. In patients with cardiac dysfunction after MI, ICD therapy has been shown to have a significant prognostic effect in comparison with conventional medical therapy.
769
, 
770
, 
771
 On the other hand, although sudden death from fatal arrhythmia is suppressed by an ICD,
772
 there is no significant difference in total death between ICD therapy and amiodarone or conventional medical therapy in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy.
771
, 
772
, 
773
, 
774
 However, ICD therapy improved prognosis compared with conventional medical therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy patients who have NYHA III heart failure.
772

Na+ channel blockers did not improve the prognosis, even though frequent ventricular premature contractions and non‐sustained VT associated with MI increase the risk of sudden death. In a meta‐analysis of post‐MI and heart failure cases, amiodarone reduced sudden arrhythmic death by 29% and total death by 13%.
775
 However, a subsequent RCT showed no significant difference in survival between amiodarone and placebo in either IHD or non‐IHD.
771
 Moreover, according to a recent meta‐analysis, amiodarone had no favorable effect on overall mortality, although it suppressed sudden death and cardiovascular death.
761

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone blockers, as well as β‐blockers, are known to improve mortality, including sudden death, among patients with congestive heart failure.

Polymorphic VT (PMVT) often occurs during acute myocardial ischemia, often degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF). PMVT is documented more frequently than monomorphic VT under such conditions.
776
, 
777
 Apart from acute ischemia, as the clinical entity that promotes PMVT, PMVT has been triggered by ectopic firing from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and from left Purkinje fibers.
63
, 
778
, 
779
, 
780
 The coupling interval (CI) of the triggering premature ventricular contraction (PVC) from the Purkinje fibers has been shown to be shorter and the QRS width to be narrower, as compared with the triggering PVC from the RVOT.
63
, 
781
 PMVT that is induced by PVC with a CI <300 ms is termed short‐coupled variant of TdP (Figure 26).

Direct‐current (DC) shock using biphasic waveform with >150 J should be done for the termination of PMVT, and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be initiated according to advanced cardiac life support.

 Amiodarone or nifekalant should be administered for PMVT refractory to DC shock.
740
, 
741

787

β‐blockers might be effective for bail‐out of PMVT that repeatedly appears during the subacute phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
783
 PMVT that occurs after relieving ischemia during the subacute phase of ACS or after percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic coronary syndrome is subject to progressing to ES. Quinidine has potential to terminate such PMVT.
788

The pharmacological approach to preventing short‐coupled TdP developing under the condition of neither ischemic nor structural heart disease has not been established, as there have been only retrospective cohort studies with small numbers of the patients, in which the preventive effects of β‐blockers, Ca2+ channel blockers, and quinidine on short‐coupled TdP were reported.

### Epidemiology / Pathophysiology / Electrophysiology

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defined as tachycardia originating below the bifurcation of the His bundle. Sustained VT is defined as continuing for at least 30 s or requiring intervention. VT for <30 s is called non‐sustained VT. VT is divided into that occurring in the heart with structural heart disease, and idiopathic VT with no apparent heart disease. The most common forms of idiopathic VT are fascicular left ventricular VT (LF‐VT) and VT originating in the outflow tract (OT‐VT).

The organic heart diseases in VT with structural heart disease include myocardial infarction (MI), dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, and post‐cardiac surgery.
715
 In Europe and North America, the most common underlying disease is old MI. However, in Japan, the rate of cardiomyopathy is relatively high.
1
 Sustained VT is a major cause of syncope and sudden death due to arrhythmia. The risk of sudden death increases in patients with reduced cardiac function because of the underlying disease.

Regarding idiopathic VT, LF‐VT is often reported in Asia, including Japan.
716
, 
717
 Both LF‐VT and OT‐VT are likely to occur with physical exercise or mental excitation. In general, idiopathic VT has a better prognosis than VT with structural heart disease.

Most cases of VT with structural heart disease are caused by reentry, dependent on the scar tissue associated with the organic heart disease.
718
 Cardiomyocytes are surrounded by fibrous tissue in the scar area, which causes conduction disturbance and formation of a reentry circuit.
719
, 
720
 Infiltration of adipocytes also contributes to the formation of reentry circuits.
721
 Sustained VT with structural heart disease typically presents as a monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia, and is often evoked and terminated by programmed stimulation.

Idiopathic LF‐VT is caused by abnormal Purkinje fibers in part of the reentry circuit.
722
, 
723
, 
724
 Because it is known that abnormal Purkinje fibers have decremental conduction properties and verapamil sensitivity, LF‐VT is also called verapamil‐sensitive VT.
725
 A bundle branch reentry is considered another type of VT originating from the bundle branch and Purkinje fibers.
726
 These VTs have an anatomically fixed reentry circuit and can be diagnosed as reentry by electrophysiological study.

The focus of OT‐VT is distributed through the left and right ventricular OTs, the left ventricular epicardium, the cusp of the aortic valve, the pulmonary artery, and the basal septum, although the most frequent focus is in the right OT.

### Epidemiology

The organic heart diseases in VT with structural heart disease include myocardial infarction (MI), dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, cardiac sarcoidosis, and post‐cardiac surgery.
715
 In Europe and North America, the most common underlying disease is old MI. However, in Japan, the rate of cardiomyopathy is relatively high.
1
 Sustained VT is a major cause of syncope and sudden death due to arrhythmia. The risk of sudden death increases in patients with reduced cardiac function because of the underlying disease.

Regarding idiopathic VT, LF‐VT is often reported in Asia, including Japan.
716
, 
717
 Both LF‐VT and OT‐VT are likely to occur with physical exercise or mental excitation. In general, idiopathic VT has a better prognosis than VT with structural heart disease.

### Pathophysiology / Electrophysiology

Most cases of VT with structural heart disease are caused by reentry, dependent on the scar tissue associated with the organic heart disease.
718
 Cardiomyocytes are surrounded by fibrous tissue in the scar area, which causes conduction disturbance and formation of a reentry circuit.
719
, 
720
 Infiltration of adipocytes also contributes to the formation of reentry circuits.
721
 Sustained VT with structural heart disease typically presents as a monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia, and is often evoked and terminated by programmed stimulation.

Idiopathic LF‐VT is caused by abnormal Purkinje fibers in part of the reentry circuit.
722
, 
723
, 
724
 Because it is known that abnormal Purkinje fibers have decremental conduction properties and verapamil sensitivity, LF‐VT is also called verapamil‐sensitive VT.
725
 A bundle branch reentry is considered another type of VT originating from the bundle branch and Purkinje fibers.
726
 These VTs have an anatomically fixed reentry circuit and can be diagnosed as reentry by electrophysiological study.

The focus of OT‐VT is distributed through the left and right ventricular OTs, the left ventricular epicardium, the cusp of the aortic valve, the pulmonary artery, and the basal septum, although the most frequent focus is in the right OT.

### Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia

Idiopathic VT is defined as the VT without any apparent structural heart diseases, diagnosed by physical examination, 12‐lead ECG, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with idiopathic VT generally have a preferable prognosis, and the indication of pharmacological therapy based on the patient’s preference, symptoms etc. The tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy is a reversible myocardial dysfunction due to frequent extrasystoles or tachycardia. Therapeutic options should be considered in this form of cardiomyopathy even without symptoms of tachycardia.
732

The origin and the mechanism of VT can be predicted by the QRS morphology during VT in typical idiopathic VT (Figure 22). The mode of onset (during activity or rest), ambulatory ECG recording and exercise ECG are helpful for the decision of antiarrhythmic drugs (Figure 23, Table 56).

The origin of idiopathic VT is predominantly in the area of the right ventricular OT, left ventricular OT, aortic sinus, tricuspid annulus, mitral annulus, and papillary muscle.
733
 The most frequent form of 12‐lead ECG during VT shows left bundle branch block morphology and right deviation (inferior axis), which originates from the OT (Figure 22A). The mechanism of this form of VT is mainly abnormal automaticity or triggered activity, and OT‐VT usually shows a non‐sustained and repetitive form. The mechanism of triggered activity is delayed afterdepolarization, which is responsible for the Ca2+ channel current. Antiarrhythmic drugs that inhibit the Ca2+ channel current, such as β‐blockers or non‐dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers, may be effective for OT‐VT. These drugs are administered by bolus injection to terminate VT, and then orally to prevent recurrence. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (Na+ channel blocker), such as propafenone, are an alternative choice if patients do not have reduced cardiac and renal function.

VT with right bundle branch block and left deviation (superior axis) is idiopathic reentrant VT (idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia; ILVT), related to the Purkinje network around the left bundle branch (Figure 22B). This VT is characterized as verapamil‐sensitive. Verapamil is effective for terminating and preventing this VT. Intravenous injection of 5 mg of verapamil usually terminates VT. Higher doses (>5 mg) of verapamil are sometime required to terminate VT if it has been sustained for a long time and the intrinsic adrenergic activity is high. The other form of idiopathic VT, such as papillary muscle VT, should be considered in the case of verapamil non‐sensitive VT.
723

β‐blockade is effective at inhibiting papillary muscle VT. There is no specific pharmacological approach for the other forms of idiopathic VT. β‐blocker or Class I antiarrhythmic drug is empirically administered.

Avoidance of aggravating factors, such as excessive consumption of caffeine, smoking and alcohol, may be sufficient for mild symptoms.
737
 Catheter ablation can be a highly effective treatment with high acute success rate and low recurrence rate during long‐term follow‐up.

### Ventricular Tachycardia Associated With Organic Heart Disease

VT can occur in patients with organic heart disease such as MI, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, post‐myocarditis, and congenital heart diseases, including Fallot’s tetralogy. In those cases, cardiac function is mostly deteriorated by the cardiac disease, and tachycardic attacks are more likely to occur in patients with more severe deterioration. It is very common for those patients to become hemodynamically unstable at the time of the VT attacks, and the first treatment is to terminate the tachycardia. Table 57 shows treatment of recommendations and levels of evidence for VT associated with organic heart disease.

Sustained VT associated with organic heart disease has different ECG findings depending on whether it is monomorphic or polymorphic (Figure 24).
738
 If the patient is hemodynamically unstable with VT, perform direct‐current defibrillation according to the procedure of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and consider intravenous administration of amiodarone or nifekalant as an antiarrhythmic drug (Figure 25).

 Emergency catheter ablation may be indicated for frequent recurrent monomorphic VT and non‐sustained VT. Because reentry is usually the main mechanism of sustained VT, pacing stimulation from the ventricle can be used to terminate it in many cases.

Drug selection for the purpose of termination and prevention of sustained VT associated with organic heart disease. *1In the cases of sustaining hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, the drug should be administered where immediate direct current defibrillation can be performed. *2Alternative drug when no other antiarrhythmic drug is available. *3The drug should be used only for the monomorphic sustained VT. *4The drug should be initiate from low dose and gradually increase for sustained VT. VT, ventricular tachycardia.

In patients with frequent VT after implantation of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD), intravenous administration of an antiarrhythmic drug, such as nifekalant in Japan,
744
 may be performed when using sedation and anesthesia is being considered.

If the status is hemodynamically stable, drug treatment can be considered after 12‐lead ECG recording and careful observation of hemodynamics. At the same time, proceed with a detailed evaluation of the organic heart disease from physical and laboratory findings. When an antiarrhythmic drug is intravenously administered with ECG monitoring, attention should be paid to blood pressure, bradycardia, and QRS width prolongation until the tachycardia terminates. Always keep in mind the possibility of sudden changes, and apply direct‐current defibrillation immediately the hemodynamics deteriorate due to drug administration, etc.

Intravenous administration of amiodarone, nifekalant, or procainamide is considered a first‐line drug therapy.

 If the tachycardia is stable monomorphic sustained VT, intravenous procainamide should be administered preferentially.
745
, 
746
, 
747
, 
748
 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in other countries, meta‐analyses, and retrospective studies in Japan have shown that procainamide is significantly superior to lidocaine in terminating monomorphic VT.
745
, 
746
, 
747
 In addition, procainamide is superior to amiodarone, both for terminating tachycardia and less adverse events, according to the RCTs, which targeted approximately 80% of cases of VT related to organic heart disease with cardiac dysfunction.
748
 Another study reported that amiodarone was significantly superior to lidocaine in terminating tachycardia and 1‐day survival.
749
 On the other hand, another retrospective study has reported that amiodarone had limited acute effect on terminating VT in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cardiac dysfunction,
750
 which suggests the acute effect of terminating VT by amiodarone is not been well established. With nifekalant, VT was terminated in 52.8% of the Japanese study patients.
744
 Although lidocaine is not recommended for monomorphic VT,
745
, 
746
, 
747
, 
749
, 
751
 it may be selected as an alternative drug when amiodarone, nifekalant, and procainamide cannot be used or the patient is in the acute phase of MI.
752
 Intravenous drip infusion of landiolol, a very short‐acting β
1‐blocker, is recommended for recurrent VT associated with organic heart disease in which antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, and nifekalant are ineffective.
753
, 
754
 It should be intravenously administered with gradually increasing dose while monitoring hemodynamics and ECG. Intravenous administration of sotalol, which is not available in Japan, has been shown to be significantly superior to terminating tachycardia compared with lidocaine.
745
, 
751

Prevention of VT associated with organic heart disease is classified into primary prevention to prevent the onset of symptoms, and secondary prevention to prevent recurrence of attacks. As sustained VT is directly related to prognosis, positive consideration to preventing it should be given. First, fully evaluate whether there is any possibility that VT is associated with reversible factors such as ischemia, electrolyte abnormality, and drugs. When myocardial ischemia causes tachycardia, coronary revascularization is strongly considered. When drug administration is tried to prevent tachycardia, the drug with fewest side effects should be selected because of the need for long‐term administration.

Implantation of an ICD is the first choice for preventing recurrent hemodynamically unstable VT.
755
, 
756
, 
757

Even if VT is hemodynamically stable, unstable VT can occasionally occur later in patients with organic heart disease such as IHD with cardiac dysfunction. An ICD is recommended in such cases for preventing poor prognosis.
758
, 
759
 Drug therapy is used when an ICD cannot be implanted or when it reduces the occurrence of VT in an ICD‐implanted patient. Whether or not an antiarrhythmic drug is used for an ICD‐implanted patient depends on the case and the facility’s policy. Drugs that can terminate VT do not always have the effect of preventing recurrence.

Amiodarone and sotalol are mainly used to prevent recurrence of VT.
84
, 
760
, 
761
 Bepridil or β‐blocker may be used in some cases. Generally, amiodarone is used without evaluating drug effect by electrophysiological study.
755
 No one knows if drug selection based on electrophysiological study prevents recurrence of VT.
762
 According to a Japanese trial, amiodarone administration (150 or 200 mg/day) based on electrophysiological study was effective in preventing tachycardia in patients with relatively preserved cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 30–50%).
763
 On the other hand, it did not work in the patients with LVEF <30%.
763
 A multicenter RCT clarified that sotalol significantly reduces both mortality and the need for ICD operation.
764
 In addition, it has been reported that the combination of amiodarone and β‐blocker significantly reduced the need for ICD operation compared with administration of β‐blocker or sotalol alone.
84

Electrical storm (ES) patients should be managed in hospital. Amiodarone or nifekalant is generally used to suppress the recurrence of arrhythmias, and a combination of amiodarone with propranolol significantly suppresses the occurrence of events compared with amiodarone plus metoprolol.
765
 In cases where these drugs are ineffective, Na+ channel blockers can be used while checking their effectiveness. Cather ablation is recommended when arrhythmia control is difficult even with the abovementioned drugs.
766
, 
767
, 
768
 At this time, do not forget the use of pharmacotherapy to prevent deterioration of the organic heart disease.

Holter‐ECG monitoring in out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest and sudden death, and the effectiveness of ICDs in primary prevention of sudden death clarify that VT is closely associated with sudden death. However, the prognostic effect of ICDs in primary prevention varies according to the type of organic heart disease. In patients with cardiac dysfunction after MI, ICD therapy has been shown to have a significant prognostic effect in comparison with conventional medical therapy.
769
, 
770
, 
771
 On the other hand, although sudden death from fatal arrhythmia is suppressed by an ICD,
772
 there is no significant difference in total death between ICD therapy and amiodarone or conventional medical therapy in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy.
771
, 
772
, 
773
, 
774
 However, ICD therapy improved prognosis compared with conventional medical therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy patients who have NYHA III heart failure.
772

Na+ channel blockers did not improve the prognosis, even though frequent ventricular premature contractions and non‐sustained VT associated with MI increase the risk of sudden death. In a meta‐analysis of post‐MI and heart failure cases, amiodarone reduced sudden arrhythmic death by 29% and total death by 13%.
775
 However, a subsequent RCT showed no significant difference in survival between amiodarone and placebo in either IHD or non‐IHD.
771
 Moreover, according to a recent meta‐analysis, amiodarone had no favorable effect on overall mortality, although it suppressed sudden death and cardiovascular death.
761

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone blockers, as well as β‐blockers, are known to improve mortality, including sudden death, among patients with congestive heart failure.

In a meta‐analysis of post‐MI and heart failure cases, amiodarone reduced sudden arrhythmic death by 29% and total death by 13%.
775
 However, a subsequent RCT showed no significant difference in survival between amiodarone and placebo in either IHD or non‐IHD.
771
 Moreover, according to a recent meta‐analysis, amiodarone had no favorable effect on overall mortality, although it suppressed sudden death and cardiovascular death.
761

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone blockers, as well as β‐blockers, are known to improve mortality, including sudden death, among patients with congestive heart failure.

### Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in Cases Without QT Prolongation

Polymorphic VT (PMVT) often occurs during acute myocardial ischemia, often degenerating into ventricular fibrillation (VF). PMVT is documented more frequently than monomorphic VT under such conditions.
776
, 
777
 Apart from acute ischemia, as the clinical entity that promotes PMVT, PMVT has been triggered by ectopic firing from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and from left Purkinje fibers.

, 
778
, 
779
, 
780
 The coupling interval (CI) of the triggering premature ventricular contraction (PVC) from the Purkinje fibers has been shown to be shorter and the QRS width to be narrower, as compared with the triggering PVC from the RVOT.
63
, 
781
 PMVT that is induced by PVC with a CI <300 ms is termed short‐coupled variant of TdP (Figure 26).

The pharmacological approach to preventing short‐coupled TdP developing under the condition of neither ischemic nor structural heart disease has not been established, as there have been only retrospective cohort studies with small numbers of the patients, in which the preventive effects of β‐blockers, Ca2+ channel blockers, and quinidine on short‐coupled TdP were reported.

### POLYMORPHIC VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA / TORSADE DE POINTES

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by QT interval prolongation on ECG and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), named torsade de pointes (TdP), leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death.
789
, 
790
 Thus, when we look at a representative ECG of TdP, we should speculate the patient may have LQTS (Figure 27A).

(A) Monitoring ECGs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de Pointes) with syncope in a patient with LQT2. Change in the R‐R interval (short–long–short) followed by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, TdP, characterized as a twisting QRS axis. (B) Secondary (Drug) induced QT prolongation. Drug‐induced TdP due to oral disopyramide (300 mg/day). A similar short–long–short change in R‐R followed by TdP. ECG, electrocardiogram; LQT2, long QT syndrome type 2; TdP, torsade de pointes.

LQTS is conventionally classified as congenital (genetic) or secondary (acquired). Secondary LQTS is determined by the QT interval not being prolonged under normal conditions but is significantly prolonged by secondary factors such as drugs and bradycardia (Figure 27B). However, recent studies have shown that nearly 30% of patients with secondary LQTS have the same genetic abnormalities as those with congenital LQTS,
791
 so secondary LQTS can be thought as a concealed type of congenital LQTS. Therefore, for either congenital or secondary LQTS, the pharmacological treatment is almost the same. Furthermore, pharmacological treatment of congenital LQTS is divided into 1) acute treatment at TdP occurrence based on QT interval prolongation, and 2) prevention of TdP and cardiac arrest or sudden death at non‐acute phase (preventive medicine).

Most cases of TdP spontaneously terminate and patients usually feel dizzy, lightheadedness and faintness (loss of consciousness); however, if it progresses to ventricular fibrillation (VF) without termination, immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and electrical defibrillation are required.

To suppress and prevent recurrence of TdP in the acute phase, intravenous injection of magnesium sulfate (bolus of 30–40 mg/kg over 5–10 min, i.e. 2 g of magnesium sulfate [1 ampoule] for adult weighing 60 kg) is recommended, and if effective, continuous infusion of 3–20 mg/min
793
 (in children: 0.05–0.3 mg/kg/min). Intravenous infusion of a β‐blocker (propranolol or landiolol) is also effective,
794
 and in some patients, antiarrhythmic drugs (lidocaine or mexiletine) or Ca2+ channel antagonists (verapamil) may be effective in suppressing TdP.
795
, 
796

When bradycardia exacerbates the QT interval prolongation and occurrence of TdP, temporary pacing to increase the heart rate is very effective. Hypokalemia often promotes development of TdP, thus maintain the serum potassium level >4.0 mEq/L as much as possible.

β‐blockers are effective for suppression of cardiac events in 74% of LQT1 and 63% of LQT2,
798
, 
799
 and are the first therapeutic choice for most cases of the congenital LQTS. Oral β‐blocker is a Class I indication for patients with a history of syncope or VT/VF, but even if asymptomatic, β‐blocker is a Class I indication for patients with QTc interval ≥470 ms (especially in LQT1 or LQT2). In case with asymptomatic and QTc <470 ms, oral β‐blocker may be recommended as a Class IIa indication in LQT1, LQT2 (both sexes) and female LQT3.
800
 Oral β‐blocker can be used (recommendation Class IIb) in asymptomatic male LQT3 with QTc <470 ms, or genetically unknown or undetermined cases
801
 (Table 59, Figure 28).

 Flecainide is effective in LQT7 (Andersen‐Tawil syndrome), as well as in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).
809

The Ca2+ channel blocker, verapamil, suppresses early afterdepolarization and development of TdP in the acute phase,
795
, 
796
 so might be effective as a supportive therapy in patients who still have recurrence of events despite optimal β‐blocker therapy. Verapamil can be effective in a case of LQT8 (Timothy syndrome) caused by a gain‐of‐function mutation in the CACNA1C gene;
810
 however, there was no evidence of suppression of events by oral Ca2+ channel blockers over a long‐term follow‐up.

Hypokalemia exacerbates the increase in the QT interval, so potassium containing drugs is sometimes prescribed as a supportive treatment in LQTS. Maintaining the serum potassium level >4.0 mEq/L may be effective in suppressing cardiac events
811
, 
812
 (Table 60).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Other Pharmacological Treatment Except for β‐Blockers in Congenital LQTS

COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; LQTS, long QT syndrome; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

In congenital LQTS, TdP is sometimes induced by drugs. Therefore, in either congenital or acquired LQTS, patients should not take any medicine that has a potential to prolong the QT interval (Table 61).

Causes of Acquired Long QT Syndrome

Please refer to the acute therapy of secondary (acquired) LQTS (Figure 29).

Regarding the treatment of acquired LQTS, the first priority is to remove any factor that is prolonging the QT interval, and the second is to treat any primary disease that may be inducing prolongation of the QT interval. It is important to remove secondary factors, as shown in Table 61; for example, withdraw a culprit drug, conduct the pacing therapy for bradycardia and correct hypokalemia. In cases of TdP, physicians must treat the patient as an emergency as described below and need to follow‐up the patient under continuous ECG monitoring on hospitalization until the causative factor can be removed and TdP is no longer a risk (Figure 29).

793
, 
813
 but physicians should consider reducing or ceasing magnesium sulfate administration if adverse effects occurred. Carefully observe the patient’s physical condition, and control the dosage under monitoring of the plasma concentration of magnesium sulfate because patients with renal dysfunction or elderly patients can easily become hypermagnesemia.

(2) Infusion of isoproterenol: 0.5–5 μg/min (0.1–1 μg/kg/min in children). The infusion rate should be adjusted to keep heart rate >100 beats/min; however, this therapy should be used as a bridge therapy to temporary pacing.
814
 Moreover, this therapy is not recommended for patients with congenital LQTS because of its exacerbating effect to QT interval prolongation.
815

(3) Serum potassium is adjusted to maintain within 4.5∼5.0 mEq/mL.
792
 Patients need to be kept ≥70 beats/min under overdrive pacing for the prevention of TdP induced by a short–long–short sequence pattern.

### VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION AND VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL DISEASES

Several hypotheses of the mechanism underlying the specific ECG manifestation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) have been proposed for Brugada syndrome (BrS) and early repolarization syndrome (ERS). One of the major theories reported by experimental studies relies on a prominent transient outward current (I
to) in epicardial cells but not in endocardial cells, which creates a transmural voltage gradient and thus causes J–ST‐segment elevation.
817
 Prominent I
to‐mediated dispersion of repolarization also leads to the development of reentrant arrhythmia. Despite still being controversial, this hypothesis suggests that reduced I
to and increased inward current (I
Na, I
Ca) can decrease J–ST‐segment elevation and suppress reentrant arrhythmia. In fact, the pharmacologic mechanism of therapeutic agents that are effective in BrS and ERS is quite similar to this hypothesis.

Pharmacologic therapy has been reported to suppress the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia accompanied by attenuation of specific ECG change in BrS and ERS, despite still lacking studies of high evidence level.

Isoproterenol (ISP), which increases the L‐type I
Ca and reduces I
to, followed by increased heart rate, has been reported to be useful for suppressing frequent VF episodes, including electrical storm, in BrS (not covered by insurance in Japan). As reported from Japan, intravenous ISP is recommended to be administered as a bolus injection (1–2 μg) followed by continuous infusion (0.15 μg/min) or a continuous infusion (0.003–0.006 μg/kg/min).
818
, 
819

Oral pharmacologic therapy can be considered in patients with frequent ICD discharges due to VF, including electrical storm, as a chronic treatment.

In Europe and the USA, quinidine of 600–900 mg/day is recommended for the prevention of VF;
826
, 
827
 however, the usual dose in Japan is 300–600 mg/day. Careful attention is necessary to the occurrence of side effects such as gastrointestinal,
828
 and it is not recommended as an alternative to ICD because of the uncertainty of the prevention of sudden death.
820

Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been shown to suppress VF, most likely by augmentation of the Ca2+ channel current (I
Ca), as well as by reduction of I
to secondary to an increase in heart rate.
821
, 
829

Bepridil, a Ca2+ channel antagonists, blocks multiple K+ channels, including I
to. Long‐term administration of bepridil has been reported to increase the Na+ channel current. These pharmacologic mechanisms should prevent spontaneous VF episodes.
830
 It is usually effective at a dose of 200 mg/day, but patients with SCN5A mutation are reported to show an effect even at a dose of 100 mg/day.
822
 Combination with cilostazol is also reported to be effective.
823

831
 disopyramide,
832
 and denopamine

Similar to BrS, ICD is the first‐line treatment for prevention of sudden cardiac death, and pharmacologic therapy is only an adjunct treatment in ERS. There are fewer studies and reports on pharmacologic therapy for ERS than for BrS, and the evidence level is low (Table 64).

 Quinidine can be considered for prevention of VF in patients with ICD indication but without consent of ICD implantation, but its long‐term efficacy is unknown. Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea caused by quinidine are known to be common in Japanese patients, thus caution is required when it is administered.

Several genetic mutations associated with CPVT are reported. CPVT1 is the most common genetic mutation, encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2).

 CPVT2 is the second most common genetic mutation, encoding calsequestrin2 (CASQ2).

 These genetic mutations lead to abnormal Ca2+ handling and Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, various ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillation can develop due to delayed afterdepolarization. It is reported that about 1/7 to 1/8 of all unexplained sudden cardiac deaths might be caused by CPVT.

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare inherited arrhythmia characterized by markedly shortened QT intervals, atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), episodes of syncope and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). Accoriding to the HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes., SQTS is diagnosed in the presence of (1) QT ≤330 msec, or (2) QT <360 ms and one of the following conditions: presence of SQTS mutation, family history of SQTS, family history of sudden cardiac death which occured less than 40 years old, and VT/VF without organic heart disease.
863
 The diagnosis is based on the QT interval, clinical symptoms, family history, and genetic mutations. On the other hand, in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, SQTS is (1) diagnosed in the presence of QTc ≤340 ms (Class I), and (2) should be considered in the presence of a QTc ≤360 ms and ≥1 of the following: (a) confirmed pathogenic mutation, (b) family history of SQTS, (c) family history of SCD at age <40 years, (d) surviving a VT/VF episode in the absence of organic heart disease (Class IIa).
850
 Mutations in 7 genes encoding the K+ channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2), L‐type Ca2+ channels (CACNA1C, CACNB2b, and CACNA2D1), and the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (SLC4A3) have hitherto been reported in SQTS. An ICD is the most effective treatment for preventing sudden death in high‐risk patients, and is recommended in patients with a diagnosis of SQTS who (a) are survivors of an aborted cardiac arrest, and/or (b) have documented spontaneous sustained VT (Class I).
850
, 
863

The purpose of pharmacologic therapy in patients with SQTS is to prevent concomitant AF and ventricular arrhythmias. In patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias during ICD treatment, or in patients who are eligible for ICD treatment but for whom it cannot be done for any reason, pharmacologic treatment should be considered to prevent VF. Many previous reports have shown the effectiveness of quinidine and it is considered as the first‐line pharmacologic treatment of SQTS.
864

865

866

867

In 2017, Mazzanti et al
867
 reported the inhibitory effect of quinidine on arrhythmic events in 17 SQTS cases. Two patients discontinued the drug due to gastrointestinal symptoms, and the remaining 15 patients received quinidine (584 ± 53 mg/day) for approximately 6 years. Quinidine treatment prolonged the QTc interval by a mean of 60 ms. No fatal arrhythmic events were observed in the quinidine group during the follow‐up period, and the annual rate of cardiac arrest before and after treatment improved from 12% to 0%. Quinidine has a high pharmacological affinity for the activated state of IKr channels, while other IKr inhibitors such as sotalol have a high affinity for the inactivated state of the channels.
868
 Therefore, quinidine may have a greater effect on QT prolongation than sotalol in SQTS type 1 (e.g., KCNH2‐N588K mutation), which is enhanced IKr channel function.
865
, 
869
 In small cohorts of patients, disopyramide,
870
, 
871
 nifekalant
872
 or a combination of both
873
 have been reported to prolong the QTc interval; isoproterenol
874
 and amiodarone
875
 have been reported to inhibit VF; and propafenone has been reported to inhibit AF.
876
 Accoring to the HRS/EHRS/APHRS expert consensus statement in 2013, the use of quinidine or sotalol is considered as Class IIb recommendation for the patients with asymptomatic SQTS who had a family history of SCD.
863
 In the 2015 ESC guidelines, quinidine or sotalol may be considered in asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of SQTS and a family history of SCD, patients who qualify for an ICD but present a contraindication to the ICD or refuse it (Class IIb).
850
 However, because of the lack of evidence for sotalol, only quinidine is recommended in this guideline (Table 68).

### Brugada Syndrome and Early Repolarization Syndrome

Several hypotheses of the mechanism underlying the specific ECG manifestation and ventricular fibrillation (VF) have been proposed for Brugada syndrome (BrS) and early repolarization syndrome (ERS). One of the major theories reported by experimental studies relies on a prominent transient outward current (I
to) in epicardial cells but not in endocardial cells, which creates a transmural voltage gradient and thus causes J–ST‐segment elevation.
817
 Prominent I
to‐mediated dispersion of repolarization also leads to the development of reentrant arrhythmia. Despite still being controversial, this hypothesis suggests that reduced I
to and increased inward current (I
Na, I
Ca) can decrease J–ST‐segment elevation and suppress reentrant arrhythmia. In fact, the pharmacologic mechanism of therapeutic agents that are effective in BrS and ERS is quite similar to this hypothesis.

Pharmacologic therapy has been reported to suppress the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia accompanied by attenuation of specific ECG change in BrS and ERS, despite still lacking studies of high evidence level.

### Other Inherited Arrhythmias (Short QT Syndrome)

Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare inherited arrhythmia characterized by markedly shortened QT intervals, atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), episodes of syncope and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). Accoriding to the HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes., SQTS is diagnosed in the presence of (1) QT ≤330 msec, or (2) QT <360 ms and one of the following conditions: presence of SQTS mutation, family history of SQTS, family history of sudden cardiac death which occured less than 40 years old, and VT/VF without organic heart disease.
863
 The diagnosis is based on the QT interval, clinical symptoms, family history, and genetic mutations. On the other hand, in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, SQTS is (1) diagnosed in the presence of QTc ≤340 ms (Class I), and (2) should be considered in the presence of a QTc ≤360 ms and ≥1 of the following: (a) confirmed pathogenic mutation, (b) family history of SQTS, (c) family history of SCD at age <40 years, (d) surviving a VT/VF episode in the absence of organic heart disease (Class IIa).
850
 Mutations in 7 genes encoding the K+ channels (KCNH2, KCNQ1, and KCNJ2), L‐type Ca2+ channels (CACNA1C, CACNB2b, and CACNA2D1), and the Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (SLC4A3) have hitherto been reported in SQTS. An ICD is the most effective treatment for preventing sudden death in high‐risk patients, and is recommended in patients with a diagnosis of SQTS who (a) are survivors of an aborted cardiac arrest, and/or (b) have documented spontaneous sustained VT (Class I).
850
, 
863

The purpose of pharmacologic therapy in patients with SQTS is to prevent concomitant AF and ventricular arrhythmias. In patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias during ICD treatment, or in patients who are eligible for ICD treatment but for whom it cannot be done for any reason, pharmacologic treatment should be considered to prevent VF. Many previous reports have shown the effectiveness of quinidine and it is considered as the first‐line pharmacologic treatment of SQTS.
864
, 
865
, 
866
, 
867

In 2017, Mazzanti et al
867
 reported the inhibitory effect of quinidine on arrhythmic events in 17 SQTS cases. Two patients discontinued the drug due to gastrointestinal symptoms, and the remaining 15 patients received quinidine (584 ± 53 mg/day) for approximately 6 years. Quinidine treatment prolonged the QTc interval by a mean of 60 ms. No fatal arrhythmic events were observed in the quinidine group during the follow‐up period, and the annual rate of cardiac arrest before and after treatment improved from 12% to 0%. Quinidine has a high pharmacological affinity for the activated state of IKr channels, while other IKr inhibitors such as sotalol have a high affinity for the inactivated state of the channels.
868
 Therefore, quinidine may have a greater effect on QT prolongation than sotalol in SQTS type 1 (e.g., KCNH2‐N588K mutation), which is enhanced IKr channel function.
865
, 
869
 In small cohorts of patients, disopyramide,
870
, 
871
 nifekalant
872
 or a combination of both
873
 have been reported to prolong the QTc interval; isoproterenol
874
 and amiodarone
875
 have been reported to inhibit VF; and propafenone has been reported to inhibit AF.
876
 Accoring to the HRS/EHRS/APHRS expert consensus statement in 2013, the use of quinidine or sotalol is considered as Class IIb recommendation for the patients with asymptomatic SQTS who had a family history of SCD.
863
 In the 2015 ESC guidelines, quinidine or sotalol may be considered in asymptomatic patients with a diagnosis of SQTS and a family history of SCD, patients who qualify for an ICD but present a contraindication to the ICD or refuse it (Class IIb).
850
 However, because of the lack of evidence for sotalol, only quinidine is recommended in this guideline (Table 68).

### VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION / PULSELESS VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA / CARDIAC ARREST

Because ventricular fibrillation (VF)/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT) are extremely severe arrhythmias causing rapid decline in cardiac output and possibly leading to unconsciousness and cardiac arrest, they require immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CRP). Figure 31 shows the treatment flowchart. Concomitant use of vasopressin
877
, 
878
 and routine use of magnesium are not recommended.
879
, 
880
 However, magnesium may be considered in cases of polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation.
881
 Atropine is not recommended for routine use in either pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole,
881
 but such usage should be considered in the case of ineffective adrenaline administration for asystole.
882
 Figure 32 shows the method for performing left stellate ganglion block against refractory VT/VF.

Antiarrhythmic drugs are associated with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), but there is no proof of long‐term survival or favorable neurological outcome. According to a systematic review/meta‐analysis of 17 previous reports (10 reports from randomized controlled trials and 7 reports from observational studies), amiodarone injection, lidocaine, and nifekalant can be effective for obtaining ROSC, but had no improvement on survival discharge.
883
 In a recent systematic review/meta‐analysis (30 previous reports, 39,914 patients), there was no conclusive evidence that amiodarone, lidocaine, esmolol, nifekalant, sotalol, magnesium, or vasopressin may possibly improve ROSC, survival admission, survival discharge, and neurological outcome, and only nifekalant achieved significantly more cases of survival admission compared with lidocaine.
740

According to a multicenter cohort study in Japan, the groups administered nifekalant, amiodarone, or lidocaine indicated higher 1‐month survival rates compared with the non‐administration group, but neurological outcomes remain unknown.

Although amiodarone was effective for survival admission in the 2015 guideline presented by the American Heart Association,
743
, 
892
 it could not obtain favorable survival discharge and neurological outcome compared with placebo in a large double‐blind randomized controlled trial presented in 2016.
739
 Although there were similar results in meta‐analyses,
893
, 
894
 survival discharge did not indicate more favorable outcomes compared with lidocaine in an analysis of the administrative claim database of Japan.
895
 According to a multicenter cohort study and review in Japan, amiodarone 125–150 mg can be superior to 300 mg in terms of efficacy and reduction in side effects.
741
, 
885
 Thus, the appropriate initial dose of amiodarone might be ≤150 mg.

Nifekalant has a greater defibrillation effect than lidocaine or other conventional treatments.
742
, 
886
, 
887
, 
888
 According to a multicenter cohort study in Japan, nifekalant or amiodarone improved the 24‐h survival rate to the same degree.
741
 On the basis of an administrative claim database study
889
 and a single‐center prospective study
890
 in Japan, there was no difference in ROSC between nifekalant and amiodarone, but nifekalant could potentially improve survival admission. As one of the reasons, the time to successful defibrillation was shorter than with amiodarone.
890
, 
891
 Thus, there are more reports in Japan indicating the usefulness of nifekalant in such cases.

In a large‐scale clinical study of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest cases, lidocaine was inferior to amiodarone in survival admission but showed no difference in survival discharge.
743
 The large‐scale clinical trials described previously did not indicate either a higher rate of survival discharge or favorable neurological outcomes compared with placebo.
739

It is reported that sympathetic block treatment (e.g., esmolol intravenous injection, propranolol intravenous injection, and stellate ganglion block) could be more effective than conventional antiarrhythmic drugs against electrical storm (ES) after acute myocardial infarction.
783
 The clinical studies in Japan, such as J‐Land II, reported some usefulness of landiolol intravenous injection against nifekalant/amiodarone‐resistant ES.
753
, 
754
 Furthermore, it was also indicated that left stellate ganglion block could be effective for nifekalant‐resistant VF/pVT in the case of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest.
896
 Stellate ganglion block is a method of administering infiltration anesthesia to sympathetic ganglion after confirming the 6th cervical vertebra at the level of the cricoid cartilage by ultrasound examination of the neck.
897
, 
898
 It is effective as a means of treating VF/pVT that cannot be controlled by conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.
899

Although there is an observational study describing suppression of recurrence by lidocaine in terms of antiarrhythmic drug administration as a preventive, it did not indicate a significant effect on survival admission or survival discharge in the propensity score analysis.
900
 It is reported that administration of early β‐blocker (oral or intravenous injection) after ROSC could increase chances of long‐term survival,
901
 but it also may possibly cause hemodynamic instability, worsening of heart failure, and bradyarrhythmia.

### Lidocaine

In a large‐scale clinical study of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest cases, lidocaine was inferior to amiodarone in survival admission but showed no difference in survival discharge.
743
 The large‐scale clinical trials described previously did not indicate either a higher rate of survival discharge or favorable neurological outcomes compared with placebo.
739

### β‐Blockers

It is reported that sympathetic block treatment (e.g., esmolol intravenous injection, propranolol intravenous injection, and stellate ganglion block) could be more effective than conventional antiarrhythmic drugs against electrical storm (ES) after acute myocardial infarction.
783
 The clinical studies in Japan, such as J‐Land II, reported some usefulness of landiolol intravenous injection against nifekalant/amiodarone‐resistant ES.
753
, 
754
 Furthermore, it was also indicated that left stellate ganglion block could be effective for nifekalant‐resistant VF/pVT in the case of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest.
896
 Stellate ganglion block is a method of administering infiltration anesthesia to sympathetic ganglion after confirming the 6th cervical vertebra at the level of the cricoid cartilage by ultrasound examination of the neck.
897
, 
898
 It is effective as a means of treating VF/pVT that cannot be controlled by conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.
899

### Treatment by Antiarrhythmic Drugs After Return of Spontaneous Circulation

Although there is an observational study describing suppression of recurrence by lidocaine in terms of antiarrhythmic drug administration as a preventive, it did not indicate a significant effect on survival admission or survival discharge in the propensity score analysis.
900
 It is reported that administration of early β‐blocker (oral or intravenous injection) after ROSC could increase chances of long‐term survival,
901
 but it also may possibly cause hemodynamic instability, worsening of heart failure, and bradyarrhythmia.

### ARRHYTHMIAS IN PEDIATRICS

The mechanisms of most arrhythmias in pediatric patients are the same as in adult patients. However, prevalence, natural history, and expression of symptoms of arrhythmias differ in children according to their age. As a result, treatment strategies also differ between adults and children. Typical symptoms during tachycardia in infants are vomiting, poor feeding, and respiratory distress, and in preschool children, chest or abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. In school‐age children, palpitations, and chest discomfort are the most common, but some children are first diagnosed with arrhythmias in school heart screening without any symptoms.

Indications of catheter ablation for tachyarrhythmias in children are expanding to infants and perioperative patients with congenital heart disease, consequently the importance of antiarrhythmic medications for tachycardia has relatively declined, but they still remain valuable therapy in some pediatric patients for bridge therapy to catheter ablation or with difficulty to perform catheter ablation in some reason.

This guideline is based on the “Guideline for Antiarrhythmic Drugs” developed by the Japanese Society of Pediatric Cardiology,
902
 and other local and foreign guidelines

 for children.

The evidence for antiarrhythmic drug therapy in children is much less than for adults, and most of the studies have been retrospective, small in size, and observational. As a result, most of the indications and dosages of antiarrhythmic drugs in children are basically determined according to those in adults, and only a few drugs have determined indications and dosages after clinical trials in children. For these reasons, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in children largely depends on the experience of the physician. In this guideline, pediatric patients are defined as those under 15 years of age.

Narrow QRS tachycardia is clinically equal to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and includes the following diagnoses: atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrial tachycardia (AT), and intra‐atrial reentrant tachycardia. AVRT accounts for more than half of the cases in preschool children, whereas AVNRT is more common in school‐aged children.
903

In neonates and infants, sustained or repetitive tachycardia is likely to result in heart failure, because they cannot complain of palpitations; therefore, the tachycardia should be terminated as soon as possible (Figure 33).

Flow chart to terminate SVT in children. *Off‐label. †Contraindicated for neonates and infants. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

In critically ill children with tachycardia, if it is not determined to be SVT, synchronized electrical cardioversion (0.5–2.0 J/kg) should be performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation if necessary. In hemodynamically stable children with tachycardia, vagal stimulation (e.g., breath‐holding, ice immersion, carotid sinus massage) should be performed, and if these are not effective, antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered. Transesophageal atrial overdrive pacing can also be useful in neonates and infants, and vagal reflexes by insertion of an esophageal catheter may terminate tachycardia in some patients.

The tachycardia circuit of most SVTs includes the AV node. Therefore, bolus intravenous administration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which transiently suppresses AV nodal conduction, is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of SVT.
906
, 
907
, 
909
, 
910
 The effect of ATP is augmented by the use of dipyridamole, and attenuated by the use of xanthine derivatives. In addition, we need to pay attention to bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Due to the short half‐life of ATP in blood, ATP should be administered bolus injection as rapidly as possible, followed by an adequate amount of physiological saline or 5% glucose solution infusion.

Ca2+ channel blocker (verapamil)
911
, 
913
 or digoxin is administered intravenously in recurrent cases. Verapamil may be given in older children but is contraindicated in small infants because it may lead to cardiovascular collapse.
911
, 
914
 In AVRT, slow intravenous administration of a Class IC (flecainide) or IA (procainamide and disopyramide) antiarrhythmic drug is also recommended because of the prolonged refractory period of the accessory pathways. Amiodarone is also recommended when other drugs are ineffective. It may take some time to terminate tachycardia after injection of amiodarone, and one may need to pay attention to hypotension, especially in infants and neonates.
915

Prophylactic treatment of SVT in children. SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

The indication for prophylactic treatment of arrhythmia is repetitive or long‐lasting tachycardia. Newborns and infants are likely to develop heart failure, because the tachycardia is usually noticed only after the patient becomes quite ill. Therefore, antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered to prevent tachycardia.

In recent years, the selection of antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent SVT has shifted towards Class IC or III drugs away from digoxin and β‐blockers.
849
 Combinations of these drugs are effective for SVT that is refractory to monotherapy,
916
 but interactions and arrhythmogenesis with multiple antiarrhythmic drugs also need to be considered. If the SVT is recurrent after 1 year of age, it is unlikely to resolve spontaneously,
917
 and long‐term drug management should be considered according to the severity of the tachyarrhythmia. In patients with short duration and spontaneously terminated tachycardia without organic heart disease or pre‐excitation syndrome, antitachycardia medication is usually unnecessary. Children with a history of tachycardia, or their guardians, should be educated in how to terminate the tachycardia with appropriate vagal stimulation maneuvers according to their ages.

The safety and efficacy of catheter ablation in children has improved, and it should be considered for children aged >5 years, or body weight >15 kg, who require continuous antiarrhythmic medication. However, the indication of catheter ablation should be carefully determined by the type and origin of the arrhythmia, and body size. On the other hand, a single oral dose to be taken only during an attack may be recommended in cases of ineffective of vagal nerve stimulation procedures. However, the indication of antiarrhythmic medication should be restricted in children with severe left ventricular dysfunction and/or sinus bradycardia. The efficacy of a single oral dose of verapamil, propranolol
110
 or sotalol
918
 has been reported.

The frequency of AVNRT is <10% in infants and toddlers, but higher in patients over 5 years of age. The indication of catheter ablation is determined by age, body size, severity of symptoms, frequency and duration of tachyarrhythmia, efficacy and side effect of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the presence of concomitant cardiac disease. Catheter ablation is the first‐line treatment for older children because the efficacy of pharmacotherapy is 30–50%, and the risk of AV block associated with catheter ablation is low in older children.
4
, 
849

The standard prophylactic medication for AVNRT in children has been Ca2+ channel blockers and β‐blockers. The monotherapy with atenolol was reported to be effective in 59% of adolescents with AVNRT.
919
 The combination of β‐blocker and Class IC drug was preferred in patients without sufficient suppression of AV nodal conduction and no structural heart disease.
849

Pre‐excitation syndrome can cause AVRT via accessory pathway, rapid ventricular conduction via antegrade accessory pathway with atrial fibrillation (AF),
920
 and decreased ventricular function associated with ventricular dyssynchronous contractions.
921
 The onset of AVRT in children doublepeaks in infants or teenagers. Over 90% of patients with pre‐excitation syndrome diagnosed in infancy show improvement of the tachycardia by 18 months of age.
922
, 
923
 However, those without improvement tend to have persistent tachycardia episodes (Table 70).

If the accessory pathway has a short anterograde refractory period, rapid conduction to the ventricles may occur during AF. The incidence of sudden cardiac death in a cohort of pediatric and adult patients with pre‐excitation syndrome was 0.0025, 0.0000, and 0.0015 per patient‐year for symptomatic, asymptomatic, and the overall patients, respectively.

 Catheter ablation is the first‐line treatment for pre‐excitation syndrome in older children with tachycardia, and pharmacotherapy is recommended as the first‐line therapy in children under 5 years of age with recurrent SVT.

, 
849
 Therefore, long‐term management with antiarrhythmic drugs is still recommended in infants and older children who are a high risk for catheter ablation.

The results of pharmacotherapy for SVT in infants and toddlers have been reported in different clinical situations such as age, dosages of antiarrhythmic drugs, and association of organic heart disease.

 In children with pre‐excitation syndrome, Class IC, IA, or III drugs are preferred to prolong the refractory period of the accessory pathway, especially in cases of a short effective refractory period.

The efficacy of flecainide is reported to be 73–100%,
933
, 
934
 with no deaths, and <1% of serious proarrhythmic events.
933
 The efficacy of sotalol is reported to have an efficacy be 64–94%,

936
, 
937
, 
938
 and ≈10% of proarrhythmic events such as sinus atrial block, advanced AV block, and torsade de pointes (TdP).
937
 Reports of the use of amiodarone for AVRT are limited, and none has demonstrated that amiodarone is superior to Class IC medications or sotalol from the efficacy and safety standpoints. Amiodarone should be administered to patients with uncontrollable tachycardia by several conventional antiarrhythmic drugs and with a high risk for catheter ablation.
849

In addition, one should keep in mind that the use of drugs to suppress AV nodal conduction in children with WPW syndrome has a risk of rapid conduction to the ventricles during AF.
939

Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) mainly presents in 2–10% of pediatric patients in the early postoperative period after surgery for the following congenital heart diseases (CHDs): ventricular septal defect, AV septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the great arteries, and the Norwood operation.
940
 Although JET usually recovers spontaneously within a few days, it can be fatal in the early postoperative period due to hypotension and hemodynamic collapse. Therefore, aggressive and intensive treatment for JET may be required, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Table 71).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Therapeutic Intervention for Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia in Pediatric Patients

Abbreviations: COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Postoperative JET is treated with combinations of reducing dose or discontinuation of catecholamine, atrial overdrive pacing, hypothermia, deep sedation, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Although amiodarone has been reported to decrease mortality from 35% to 4%,
941
, 
942
, 
943
, 
944
 monotherapy resulted in termination of JET in only 11%, and usually requires a combination of non‐pharmacological therapy.
941

In Japan, procainamide and nifekalant were commonly used before the introduction of amiodarone. The efficacy of nifekalant manifests more immediately, it has a shorter half‐life, and there is less chance of hypotension than with amiodarone; however, nifekalant has more chance of QT prolongation and TdP than amiodarone. Landiolol is also reported as an effective medication to suppress JET.
945
 If these antiarrhythmic medications are not sufficient to control JET, additional treatment with digoxin and flecainide might be effective.
849
 Intraoperative and postoperative administration of dexmedetomidine might reduce the occurrence of postoperative JET.
946
, 
947
 On the other hand, congenital or non‐surgical JET might be controlled by single use or combination of amiodarone, β‐blocker, and Class IC drug.
940

Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a long RP’ narrow QRS tachycardia due to a rare form of accessory pathway with decremental conduction properties and usually located in the posteroseptal region of tricuspid annulus. Several retrospective multicenter studies were reported that amiodarone, verapamil, and digoxin were effective for controlling PJRT in 40–85% of cases, and Class IC drugs in 60–66%.
849
 Because PJRT frequently leads to tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological therapy should be initiated without delay.
849
, 
948
, 
949
 Most of the patients with PJRT will require catheter ablation to control the tachycardia sometime in the future.
950

Treatment of atrial tachycardia. *Off‐label. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

Most of the mechanisms of AT are reported to be increased automaticity or triggered activity, but part of the mechanism of AT is micro‐reentry or macro‐reentry. AT can be repetitive or persistent, and may result in congestive heart failure or tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy. In neonates and infants, AT usually improves spontaneously in a few months, and recurrence was not common during a long follow‐up period.
647
, 
663
, 
951
 However, conversion of AT to sinus rhythm by medication is sometimes difficult, and considerable number of cases of AT require rate control.
952
 On the other hand, AT onset in older children is more resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and less likely to terminate spontaneously.
663
, 
951

Catheter ablation is the first‐line therapy for drug‐resistance, in older children, and for patients with impaired cardiac function. The purpose of pharmacological therapy is classified into termination of AT (rhythm control) and control of heart rate (rate control).

In general, AT due to automaticity is terminated by β‐blockers,
663
, 
953
 whereas AT due to triggered activity and micro‐reentry is terminated by β‐blockers and Ca2+ channel blockers, but some ATs are terminated by ATP.
954
, 
955
 In addition, Class IC and IA drugs,
930
, 
956
, 
957
, 
958
 Class III drugs,
959
, 
960
 and Class IV drugs (bepridil) are also effective for controlling refractory AT. Multidrug therapy with 1–3 drugs of digoxin, Class IC or III, combined with β‐blockers resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 70% of patients.
66
, 
951
, 
952
, 
961
 Although the outcome of multifocal AT is poor, combined use of amiodarone and propafenone was reported as effective to control multifocal AT.
956
 Antiarrhythmic drugs with negative inotropic effect should be used carefully, or avoid, in cases of decreased cardiac function.

If combined therapy fails to convert AT to sinus rhythm, combined therapy with β‐blockers, verapamil, and digoxin, which may suppress AV conduction (i.e., rate control), may be a second‐line therapy.

Atrial flutter (AFL) sometimes develops in the fetus and neonate without any organic heart disease, but the incidence is quite rare in school‐aged children. Furthermore, AFL often manifests as a late complication of surgical treatment of CHD. In hemodynamically unstable neonates, R wave‐synchronized electrical cardioversion is the first‐line therapy, and transesophageal overdrive pacing might also be effective to terminate AFL. The sinus rhythm recovery rate of cardioversion and transesophageal overdrive pacing are reported as 87% and 60–70%, respectively.
962
, 
963
 Once AFL is converted to sinus rhythm, the recurrence rate is very low, and long‐term prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be unnecessary.
962
 In the hemodynamically stable newborn with AFL, pharmacological therapy might be another option, but it may take some time until AFL terminates and resolves to sinus rhythm.

In school‐aged and older children, the mechanism of AFL without structural heart disease is counterclockwise rotating peritricuspid valve flutter. If the patient has unstable hemodynamics or syncope, synchronized electrical cardioversion should be performed. Catheter ablation is also recommended in these patients. One should note that AFL in older children may be complicated by sick sinus syndrome, and the presence of bradycardia after ablation.

The differential diagnosis of wide QRS tachycardia includes monomorphic/polymorphic VT, antidromic AVRT, SVT with bundle branch block, and rapid ventricular conduction via antegrade accessory pathway with AF. In general, fatal VT is uncommon in pediatric patients;
964
, 
965
 however, some patients with ventricular arrhythmia who developed convulsions or syncope have been misdiagnosed as neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Most of the antiarrhythmic drug therapy for wide QRS tachycardia overlaps the treatment for adults (see further discussions in relevant sections) (Figures 36 and 37).

Termination of VT. *Off‐label. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; LAD, left axis deviation; LBBB, left bundle branch block; RAD, right axis deviation; RBBB, right bundle branch block; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Prophylactic treatment of VT. ICD, implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator; LAD, left axis deviation; LBBB, left bundle branch block; RAD, right axis deviation; RBBB, right bundle branch block; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Electrical cardioversion with 1–2 J/kg should be delivered, with an increase in the dose of energy to 4 J/kg if unsuccessful. In cases of recurrence or failure to terminate the tachycardia, combined use with antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered.

In general, intravenous administration of lidocaine, nifekalant or amiodarone should be used as first‐line pharmacological therapy. In the case of neonates or patients with low cardiac function after CHD surgery, one must pay close attention to the use of intravenous amiodarone because of the potential for hypotension and circulatory collapse.
902
 Magnesium sulfate and β‐blockers may also be administered in the case of TdP.
849
 Even in stable hemodynamic patients, electrical cardioversion should always be kept on standby for emergency use.

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Pharmacotherapy of VT in Pediatric Patients

Contraindicated for neonates and infants.

Abbreviations: ICD, implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator; COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service; PVC, premature ventricular contraction; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Idiopathic VT in children is considered benign when the ventricular arrhythmia disappears during exercise. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in children is high in the neonatal period and adolescence. Although non‐sustained VT usually has a relatively good prognosis, it may cause palpitations, syncope, and also heart failure in some patients. For medical therapy, see further discussion in VT section of the adult (Chapter VII) (Table 72).
849
, 
902
 If the patient develops polymorphic VT during exercise, one should note the possibility of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT; see Chapter IX.2).

The first‐line therapy for idiopathic VT is catheter ablation in older children.
4
, 
849
 An implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) should be considered for fatal arrhythmias requiring cardioversion, and uncontrollable VT with medication or catheter ablation.

Patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) should be encouraged to make lifestyle and daily living changes. At school, children with LQT1 should avoid competitive exercise, swimming, and marathons. The first‐line pharmacotherapy is β‐blockers. Patients who remain symptomatic despite medication should be considered for an ICD. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine, medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have been reported to increase cardiac events in patients with LQTS.
966
 Neonates with LQT2 complicated by 2 : 1 AV block
967
, 
968
 may require pacemaker implantation with the use of β‐blocker or mexiletine.
968

There is a potential risk of sudden cardiac death in older children with Brugada syndrome; therefore, children who develop syncope or cardiac arrest with type I Brugada ST‐T change have a risk of VT or sudden death, and are recommended for an ICD. Implantation of ICD in children has several problems around issues with the leads because of body growth, and inappropriate shock by sinus tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia. Quinidine or other antiarrhythmic medication might be effective to delay implantation of ICD.
849

See Chapter IX.2.

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a high risk of sudden cardiac death due to distinct arrhythmia have an indication of ICD with the use of amiodarone. β‐blockers and amiodarone could be a bridging therapy in high‐risk children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy until device implantation.
849

The mechanism of arrhythmias after CHD surgery is electrical or pathological over time due to residual anatomical defect and surgical scar. After CHD surgery, there can be coincident occurrence of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the same patient.
969
, 
970
 Spontaneous disappearance of these arrhythmias is unlikely, and usually requires appropriate treatment. One should initiate antiarrhythmic medications after careful evaluation of cardiac function.

Patients after CHD surgery often develop postoperative scar tissue that may result in intra‐atrial reentrant tachycardia, because almost all surgical procedures require an atriotomy. Catheter ablation is effective treatment for these arrhythmias, and should be an option instead of long‐term pharmacological therapy.
971
 Long‐term drug therapy may not always result in good outcomes.
972
 Although amiodarone might be effective in some of these tachycardias, it has a risk of fast ventricular response, and hemodynamic compromise due to decreased atrial tachycaria rate. β‐blockers, Class IC drugs, and Class III drugs might be effective for these reentrant atrial tachycardias, and sotalol was effective for AFL in 78% of postoperative CHD patients.
973

It is well known that VT may develop in long‐term patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). It is reported that 12% of postoperative TOF patients may have VT, and in 8% of the patients it led to sudden cardiac death during 21 years’ follow‐up.
969
, 
974

β‐blockers are recommended in patients with mild symptoms associated with VT, but catheter ablation should be considered for patients with severe symptoms or sustained VT. The outcome of catheter ablation for VT after repaired TOF is reportedly favorable.
975
, 
976

Medical treatment for VT after CHD surgery might be continued until, or in some cases even after, successful catheter ablation, or ICD implantation. Patients with impaired cardiac function should avoid Class IC drugs, and the use of β‐blockers or Class III drugs is recommended.
849

Most of the patients with single ventricular physiology undergo the Fontan operation as functional hemodynamic repair, and part of the procedure is using the atrial wall as a Fontan circuit. The atrial muscle after this procedure is dilated, scarred, and arrhythmogenic; thus, occurrence of resistant atrial arrhythmia is not uncommon.
977
 These atrial arrhythmias might be improved by surgical replacement with an artificial conduit (total cavopulmonary connection),
978
 catheter ablation, or combined pharmacotherapy such as β‐blockers and Class III drugs.

, 
849
 Therefore, long‐term management with antiarrhythmic drugs is still recommended in infants and older children who are a high risk for catheter ablation.

The results of pharmacotherapy for SVT in infants and toddlers have been reported in different clinical situations such as age, dosages of antiarrhythmic drugs, and association of organic heart disease.

 In children with pre‐excitation syndrome, Class IC, IA, or III drugs are preferred to prolong the refractory period of the accessory pathway, especially in cases of a short effective refractory period.

The efficacy of flecainide is reported to be 73–100%,
933
, 
934
 with no deaths, and <1% of serious proarrhythmic events.

 The efficacy of sotalol is reported to have an efficacy be 64–94%,

936
, 
937
, 
938
 and ≈10% of proarrhythmic events such as sinus atrial block, advanced AV block, and torsade de pointes (TdP).
937
 Reports of the use of amiodarone for AVRT are limited, and none has demonstrated that amiodarone is superior to Class IC medications or sotalol from the efficacy and safety standpoints. Amiodarone should be administered to patients with uncontrollable tachycardia by several conventional antiarrhythmic drugs and with a high risk for catheter ablation.
849

In addition, one should keep in mind that the use of drugs to suppress AV nodal conduction in children with WPW syndrome has a risk of rapid conduction to the ventricles during AF.
939

Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) mainly presents in 2–10% of pediatric patients in the early postoperative period after surgery for the following congenital heart diseases (CHDs): ventricular septal defect, AV septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the great arteries, and the Norwood operation.
940
 Although JET usually recovers spontaneously within a few days, it can be fatal in the early postoperative period due to hypotension and hemodynamic collapse. Therefore, aggressive and intensive treatment for JET may be required, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Table 71).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Therapeutic Intervention for Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia in Pediatric Patients

Abbreviations: COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Postoperative JET is treated with combinations of reducing dose or discontinuation of catecholamine, atrial overdrive pacing, hypothermia, deep sedation, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Although amiodarone has been reported to decrease mortality from 35% to 4%,
941
, 
942
, 
943
, 
944
 monotherapy resulted in termination of JET in only 11%, and usually requires a combination of non‐pharmacological therapy.
941

In Japan, procainamide and nifekalant were commonly used before the introduction of amiodarone. The efficacy of nifekalant manifests more immediately, it has a shorter half‐life, and there is less chance of hypotension than with amiodarone; however, nifekalant has more chance of QT prolongation and TdP than amiodarone. Landiolol is also reported as an effective medication to suppress JET.
945
 If these antiarrhythmic medications are not sufficient to control JET, additional treatment with digoxin and flecainide might be effective.
849
 Intraoperative and postoperative administration of dexmedetomidine might reduce the occurrence of postoperative JET.
946
, 
947
 On the other hand, congenital or non‐surgical JET might be controlled by single use or combination of amiodarone, β‐blocker, and Class IC drug.

Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a long RP’ narrow QRS tachycardia due to a rare form of accessory pathway with decremental conduction properties and usually located in the posteroseptal region of tricuspid annulus. Several retrospective multicenter studies were reported that amiodarone, verapamil, and digoxin were effective for controlling PJRT in 40–85% of cases, and Class IC drugs in 60–66%.
849
 Because PJRT frequently leads to tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological therapy should be initiated without delay.
849
, 
948
, 
949
 Most of the patients with PJRT will require catheter ablation to control the tachycardia sometime in the future.
950

Treatment of atrial tachycardia. *Off‐label. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

Most of the mechanisms of AT are reported to be increased automaticity or triggered activity, but part of the mechanism of AT is micro‐reentry or macro‐reentry. AT can be repetitive or persistent, and may result in congestive heart failure or tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy. In neonates and infants, AT usually improves spontaneously in a few months, and recurrence was not common during a long follow‐up period.
647
, 
663
, 
951
 However, conversion of AT to sinus rhythm by medication is sometimes difficult, and considerable number of cases of AT require rate control.
952
 On the other hand, AT onset in older children is more resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and less likely to terminate spontaneously.
663
, 
951

Catheter ablation is the first‐line therapy for drug‐resistance, in older children, and for patients with impaired cardiac function. The purpose of pharmacological therapy is classified into termination of AT (rhythm control) and control of heart rate (rate control).

In general, AT due to automaticity is terminated by β‐blockers,
663
, 
953
 whereas AT due to triggered activity and micro‐reentry is terminated by β‐blockers and Ca2+ channel blockers, but some ATs are terminated by ATP.
954
, 
955
 In addition, Class IC and IA drugs,
930
, 
956
, 
957
, 
958
 Class III drugs,
959
, 
960
 and Class IV drugs (bepridil) are also effective for controlling refractory AT. Multidrug therapy with 1–3 drugs of digoxin, Class IC or III, combined with β‐blockers resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 70% of patients.
66

951
, 
952
, 
961
 Although the outcome of multifocal AT is poor, combined use of amiodarone and propafenone was reported as effective to control multifocal AT.
956
 Antiarrhythmic drugs with negative inotropic effect should be used carefully, or avoid, in cases of decreased cardiac function.

If combined therapy fails to convert AT to sinus rhythm, combined therapy with β‐blockers, verapamil, and digoxin, which may suppress AV conduction (i.e., rate control), may be a second‐line therapy.

Atrial flutter (AFL) sometimes develops in the fetus and neonate without any organic heart disease, but the incidence is quite rare in school‐aged children. Furthermore, AFL often manifests as a late complication of surgical treatment of CHD. In hemodynamically unstable neonates, R wave‐synchronized electrical cardioversion is the first‐line therapy, and transesophageal overdrive pacing might also be effective to terminate AFL. The sinus rhythm recovery rate of cardioversion and transesophageal overdrive pacing are reported as 87% and 60–70%, respectively.
962
, 
963
 Once AFL is converted to sinus rhythm, the recurrence rate is very low, and long‐term prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be unnecessary.
962
 In the hemodynamically stable newborn with AFL, pharmacological therapy might be another option, but it may take some time until AFL terminates and resolves to sinus rhythm.

In school‐aged and older children, the mechanism of AFL without structural heart disease is counterclockwise rotating peritricuspid valve flutter. If the patient has unstable hemodynamics or syncope, synchronized electrical cardioversion should be performed. Catheter ablation is also recommended in these patients. One should note that AFL in older children may be complicated by sick sinus syndrome, and the presence of bradycardia after ablation.

### Mechanism and Diagnosis

Narrow QRS tachycardia is clinically equal to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and includes the following diagnoses: atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), atrial tachycardia (AT), and intra‐atrial reentrant tachycardia. AVRT accounts for more than half of the cases in preschool children, whereas AVNRT is more common in school‐aged children.
903

### Acute Treatment of Narrow QRS Tachycardia

In neonates and infants, sustained or repetitive tachycardia is likely to result in heart failure, because they cannot complain of palpitations; therefore, the tachycardia should be terminated as soon as possible (Figure 33).

Flow chart to terminate SVT in children. *Off‐label. †Contraindicated for neonates and infants. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

In critically ill children with tachycardia, if it is not determined to be SVT, synchronized electrical cardioversion (0.5–2.0 J/kg) should be performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation if necessary. In hemodynamically stable children with tachycardia, vagal stimulation (e.g., breath‐holding, ice immersion, carotid sinus massage) should be performed, and if these are not effective, antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered. Transesophageal atrial overdrive pacing can also be useful in neonates and infants, and vagal reflexes by insertion of an esophageal catheter may terminate tachycardia in some patients.

The tachycardia circuit of most SVTs includes the AV node. Therefore, bolus intravenous administration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which transiently suppresses AV nodal conduction, is useful for the diagnosis and treatment of SVT.
906

907
, 
909
, 
910
 The effect of ATP is augmented by the use of dipyridamole, and attenuated by the use of xanthine derivatives. In addition, we need to pay attention to bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Due to the short half‐life of ATP in blood, ATP should be administered bolus injection as rapidly as possible, followed by an adequate amount of physiological saline or 5% glucose solution infusion.

, 
913
 or digoxin is administered intravenously in recurrent cases. Verapamil may be given in older children but is contraindicated in small infants because it may lead to cardiovascular collapse.
911
, 
914
 In AVRT, slow intravenous administration of a Class IC (flecainide) or IA (procainamide and disopyramide) antiarrhythmic drug is also recommended because of the prolonged refractory period of the accessory pathways. Amiodarone is also recommended when other drugs are ineffective. It may take some time to terminate tachycardia after injection of amiodarone, and one may need to pay attention to hypotension, especially in infants and neonates.

### Prophylactic Treatment of Narrow QRS Tachycardia (Figure 34)

Prophylactic treatment of SVT in children. SVT, supraventricular tachycardia.

The indication for prophylactic treatment of arrhythmia is repetitive or long‐lasting tachycardia. Newborns and infants are likely to develop heart failure, because the tachycardia is usually noticed only after the patient becomes quite ill. Therefore, antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered to prevent tachycardia.

In recent years, the selection of antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent SVT has shifted towards Class IC or III drugs away from digoxin and β‐blockers.
849
 Combinations of these drugs are effective for SVT that is refractory to monotherapy,
916
 but interactions and arrhythmogenesis with multiple antiarrhythmic drugs also need to be considered. If the SVT is recurrent after 1 year of age, it is unlikely to resolve spontaneously,
917
 and long‐term drug management should be considered according to the severity of the tachyarrhythmia. In patients with short duration and spontaneously terminated tachycardia without organic heart disease or pre‐excitation syndrome, antitachycardia medication is usually unnecessary. Children with a history of tachycardia, or their guardians, should be educated in how to terminate the tachycardia with appropriate vagal stimulation maneuvers according to their ages.

The safety and efficacy of catheter ablation in children has improved, and it should be considered for children aged >5 years, or body weight >15 kg, who require continuous antiarrhythmic medication. However, the indication of catheter ablation should be carefully determined by the type and origin of the arrhythmia, and body size. On the other hand, a single oral dose to be taken only during an attack may be recommended in cases of ineffective of vagal nerve stimulation procedures. However, the indication of antiarrhythmic medication should be restricted in children with severe left ventricular dysfunction and/or sinus bradycardia. The efficacy of a single oral dose of verapamil, propranolol
110
 or sotalol
918
 has been reported.

### Treatment for Each Type of Supraventricular Tachycardia

The frequency of AVNRT is <10% in infants and toddlers, but higher in patients over 5 years of age. The indication of catheter ablation is determined by age, body size, severity of symptoms, frequency and duration of tachyarrhythmia, efficacy and side effect of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the presence of concomitant cardiac disease. Catheter ablation is the first‐line treatment for older children because the efficacy of pharmacotherapy is 30–50%, and the risk of AV block associated with catheter ablation is low in older children.
4
, 
849

The standard prophylactic medication for AVNRT in children has been Ca2+ channel blockers and β‐blockers. The monotherapy with atenolol was reported to be effective in 59% of adolescents with AVNRT.
919
 The combination of β‐blocker and Class IC drug was preferred in patients without sufficient suppression of AV nodal conduction and no structural heart disease.
849

Pre‐excitation syndrome can cause AVRT via accessory pathway, rapid ventricular conduction via antegrade accessory pathway with atrial fibrillation (AF),
920
 and decreased ventricular function associated with ventricular dyssynchronous contractions.
921
 The onset of AVRT in children doublepeaks in infants or teenagers. Over 90% of patients with pre‐excitation syndrome diagnosed in infancy show improvement of the tachycardia by 18 months of age.
922
, 
923
 However, those without improvement tend to have persistent tachycardia episodes (Table 70).

 The efficacy of sotalol is reported to have an efficacy be 64–94%,
935
, 
936
, 
937
, 
938
 and ≈10% of proarrhythmic events such as sinus atrial block, advanced AV block, and torsade de pointes (TdP).
937
 Reports of the use of amiodarone for AVRT are limited, and none has demonstrated that amiodarone is superior to Class IC medications or sotalol from the efficacy and safety standpoints. Amiodarone should be administered to patients with uncontrollable tachycardia by several conventional antiarrhythmic drugs and with a high risk for catheter ablation.
849

In addition, one should keep in mind that the use of drugs to suppress AV nodal conduction in children with WPW syndrome has a risk of rapid conduction to the ventricles during AF.
939

### Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia

Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) mainly presents in 2–10% of pediatric patients in the early postoperative period after surgery for the following congenital heart diseases (CHDs): ventricular septal defect, AV septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the great arteries, and the Norwood operation.
940
 Although JET usually recovers spontaneously within a few days, it can be fatal in the early postoperative period due to hypotension and hemodynamic collapse. Therefore, aggressive and intensive treatment for JET may be required, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Table 71).

Recommendations and Levels of Evidence for Acute Therapeutic Intervention for Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia in Pediatric Patients

Abbreviations: COR, class of recommendation; GOR, grade of recommendation; LOE, level of evidence; MINDS, Medical Information Network Distribution Service.

Postoperative JET is treated with combinations of reducing dose or discontinuation of catecholamine, atrial overdrive pacing, hypothermia, deep sedation, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Although amiodarone has been reported to decrease mortality from 35% to 4%,
941
, 
942
, 
943
, 
944
 monotherapy resulted in termination of JET in only 11%, and usually requires a combination of non‐pharmacological therapy.
941

In Japan, procainamide and nifekalant were commonly used before the introduction of amiodarone. The efficacy of nifekalant manifests more immediately, it has a shorter half‐life, and there is less chance of hypotension than with amiodarone; however, nifekalant has more chance of QT prolongation and TdP than amiodarone. Landiolol is also reported as an effective medication to suppress JET.
945
 If these antiarrhythmic medications are not sufficient to control JET, additional treatment with digoxin and flecainide might be effective.
849
 Intraoperative and postoperative administration of dexmedetomidine might reduce the occurrence of postoperative JET.
946
, 
947
 On the other hand, congenital or non‐surgical JET might be controlled by single use or combination of amiodarone, β‐blocker, and Class IC drug.
940

### Permanent Junctional Reciprocating Tachycardia

Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a long RP’ narrow QRS tachycardia due to a rare form of accessory pathway with decremental conduction properties and usually located in the posteroseptal region of tricuspid annulus. Several retrospective multicenter studies were reported that amiodarone, verapamil, and digoxin were effective for controlling PJRT in 40–85% of cases, and Class IC drugs in 60–66%.
849
 Because PJRT frequently leads to tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological therapy should be initiated without delay.
849
, 
948
, 
949
 Most of the patients with PJRT will require catheter ablation to control the tachycardia sometime in the future.
950

### Focal Atrial Tachycardia/Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (Figure 35)

Treatment of atrial tachycardia. *Off‐label. ATP, adenosine triphosphate.

Most of the mechanisms of AT are reported to be increased automaticity or triggered activity, but part of the mechanism of AT is micro‐reentry or macro‐reentry. AT can be repetitive or persistent, and may result in congestive heart failure or tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy. In neonates and infants, AT usually improves spontaneously in a few months, and recurrence was not common during a long follow‐up period.
647
, 
663
, 
951
 However, conversion of AT to sinus rhythm by medication is sometimes difficult, and considerable number of cases of AT require rate control.
952
 On the other hand, AT onset in older children is more resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and less likely to terminate spontaneously.
663
, 
951

Catheter ablation is the first‐line therapy for drug‐resistance, in older children, and for patients with impaired cardiac function. The purpose of pharmacological therapy is classified into termination of AT (rhythm control) and control of heart rate (rate control).

In general, AT due to automaticity is terminated by β‐blockers,
663
, 
953
 whereas AT due to triggered activity and micro‐reentry is terminated by β‐blockers and Ca2+ channel blockers, but some ATs are terminated by ATP.
954
, 
955
 In addition, Class IC and IA drugs,
930
, 
956
, 
957
, 
958
 Class III drugs,
959
, 
960
 and Class IV drugs (bepridil) are also effective for controlling refractory AT. Multidrug therapy with 1–3 drugs of digoxin, Class IC or III, combined with β‐blockers resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 70% of patients.
66
, 
951
, 
952
, 
961
 Although the outcome of multifocal AT is poor, combined use of amiodarone and propafenone was reported as effective to control multifocal AT.
956
 Antiarrhythmic drugs with negative inotropic effect should be used carefully, or avoid, in cases of decreased cardiac function.

If combined therapy fails to convert AT to sinus rhythm, combined therapy with β‐blockers, verapamil, and digoxin, which may suppress AV conduction (i.e., rate control), may be a second‐line therapy.

### Control of Heart Rate (Rate Control)

### Atrial Flutter

Atrial flutter (AFL) sometimes develops in the fetus and neonate without any organic heart disease, but the incidence is quite rare in school‐aged children. Furthermore, AFL often manifests as a late complication of surgical treatment of CHD. In hemodynamically unstable neonates, R wave‐synchronized electrical cardioversion is the first‐line therapy, and transesophageal overdrive pacing might also be effective to terminate AFL. The sinus rhythm recovery rate of cardioversion and transesophageal overdrive pacing are reported as 87% and 60–70%, respectively.
962
, 
963
 Once AFL is converted to sinus rhythm, the recurrence rate is very low, and long‐term prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be unnecessary.
962
 In the hemodynamically stable newborn with AFL, pharmacological therapy might be another option, but it may take some time until AFL terminates and resolves to sinus rhythm.

In school‐aged and older children, the mechanism of AFL without structural heart disease is counterclockwise rotating peritricuspid valve flutter. If the patient has unstable hemodynamics or syncope, synchronized electrical cardioversion should be performed. Catheter ablation is also recommended in these patients. One should note that AFL in older children may be complicated by sick sinus syndrome, and the presence of bradycardia after ablation.

### Wide QRS Tachycardia

The differential diagnosis of wide QRS tachycardia includes monomorphic/polymorphic VT, antidromic AVRT, SVT with bundle branch block, and rapid ventricular conduction via antegrade accessory pathway with AF. In general, fatal VT is uncommon in pediatric patients;
964
, 
965
 however, some patients with ventricular arrhythmia who developed convulsions or syncope have been misdiagnosed as neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Most of the antiarrhythmic drug therapy for wide QRS tachycardia overlaps the treatment for adults (see further discussions in relevant sections) (Figures 36 and 37).

Termination of VT. *Off‐label. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; LAD, left axis deviation; LBBB, left bundle branch block; RAD, right axis deviation; RBBB, right bundle branch block; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Prophylactic treatment of VT. ICD, implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator; LAD, left axis deviation; LBBB, left bundle branch block; RAD, right axis deviation; RBBB, right bundle branch block; VT, ventricular tachycardia.

Electrical cardioversion with 1–2 J/kg should be delivered, with an increase in the dose of energy to 4 J/kg if unsuccessful. In cases of recurrence or failure to terminate the tachycardia, combined use with antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered.

In general, intravenous administration of lidocaine, nifekalant or amiodarone should be used as first‐line pharmacological therapy. In the case of neonates or patients with low cardiac function after CHD surgery, one must pay close attention to the use of intravenous amiodarone because of the potential for hypotension and circulatory collapse.
902
 Magnesium sulfate and β‐blockers may also be administered in the case of TdP.
849
 Even in stable hemodynamic patients, electrical cardioversion should always be kept on standby for emergency use.

Idiopathic VT in children is considered benign when the ventricular arrhythmia disappears during exercise. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmia in children is high in the neonatal period and adolescence. Although non‐sustained VT usually has a relatively good prognosis, it may cause palpitations, syncope, and also heart failure in some patients. For medical therapy, see further discussion in VT section of the adult (Chapter VII) (Table 72).

902
 If the patient develops polymorphic VT during exercise, one should note the possibility of catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT; see Chapter IX.2).

The first‐line therapy for idiopathic VT is catheter ablation in older children.
4
, 
849
 An implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) should be considered for fatal arrhythmias requiring cardioversion, and uncontrollable VT with medication or catheter ablation.

Patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) should be encouraged to make lifestyle and daily living changes. At school, children with LQT1 should avoid competitive exercise, swimming, and marathons. The first‐line pharmacotherapy is β‐blockers. Patients who remain symptomatic despite medication should be considered for an ICD. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine, medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have been reported to increase cardiac events in patients with LQTS.
966
 Neonates with LQT2 complicated by 2 : 1 AV block

 may require pacemaker implantation with the use of β‐blocker or mexiletine.
968

There is a potential risk of sudden cardiac death in older children with Brugada syndrome; therefore, children who develop syncope or cardiac arrest with type I Brugada ST‐T change have a risk of VT or sudden death, and are recommended for an ICD. Implantation of ICD in children has several problems around issues with the leads because of body growth, and inappropriate shock by sinus tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia. Quinidine or other antiarrhythmic medication might be effective to delay implantation of ICD.
849

See Chapter IX.2.

Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a high risk of sudden cardiac death due to distinct arrhythmia have an indication of ICD with the use of amiodarone. β‐blockers and amiodarone could be a bridging therapy in high‐risk children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy until device implantation.
849

### Treatment for Unstable Hemodynamic Patients With Wide QRS Tachycardia

Electrical cardioversion with 1–2 J/kg should be delivered, with an increase in the dose of energy to 4 J/kg if unsuccessful. In cases of recurrence or failure to terminate the tachycardia, combined use with antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered.

### Treatment of Stable Hemodynamic Patients With Wide QRS Tachycardia

In general, intravenous administration of lidocaine, nifekalant or amiodarone should be used as first‐line pharmacological therapy.

849

### Postoperative Arrhythmias in Congenital Heart Disease

The mechanism of arrhythmias after CHD surgery is electrical or pathological over time due to residual anatomical defect and surgical scar. After CHD surgery, there can be coincident occurrence of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the same patient.
969
, 
970
 Spontaneous disappearance of these arrhythmias is unlikely, and usually requires appropriate treatment. One should initiate antiarrhythmic medications after careful evaluation of cardiac function.

Patients after CHD surgery often develop postoperative scar tissue that may result in intra‐atrial reentrant tachycardia, because almost all surgical procedures require an atriotomy. Catheter ablation is effective treatment for these arrhythmias, and should be an option instead of long‐term pharmacological therapy.
971
 Long‐term drug therapy may not always result in good outcomes.
972
 Although amiodarone might be effective in some of these tachycardias, it has a risk of fast ventricular response, and hemodynamic compromise due to decreased atrial tachycaria rate. β‐blockers, Class IC drugs, and Class III drugs might be effective for these reentrant atrial tachycardias, and sotalol was effective for AFL in 78% of postoperative CHD patients.
973

It is well known that VT may develop in long‐term patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). It is reported that 12% of postoperative TOF patients may have VT, and in 8% of the patients it led to sudden cardiac death during 21 years’ follow‐up.
969
, 
974

β‐blockers are recommended in patients with mild symptoms associated with VT, but catheter ablation should be considered for patients with severe symptoms or sustained VT. The outcome of catheter ablation for VT after repaired TOF is reportedly favorable.
975
, 
976

Medical treatment for VT after CHD surgery might be continued until, or in some cases even after, successful catheter ablation, or ICD implantation. Patients with impaired cardiac function should avoid Class IC drugs, and the use of β‐blockers or Class III drugs is recommended.
849

Most of the patients with single ventricular physiology undergo the Fontan operation as functional hemodynamic repair, and part of the procedure is using the atrial wall as a Fontan circuit. The atrial muscle after this procedure is dilated, scarred, and arrhythmogenic; thus, occurrence of resistant atrial arrhythmia is not uncommon.
977
 These atrial arrhythmias might be improved by surgical replacement with an artificial conduit (total cavopulmonary connection),
978
 catheter ablation, or combined pharmacotherapy such as β‐blockers and Class III drugs.

### Arrhythmias During Pregnancy

During pregnancy, the maternal physiology changes dynamically: volume of circulating blood, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity increase, and blood electrolytes and many hormone levels associated with pregnancy fluctuate. Myocardial extension with increased preload can cause potential myocardial instability. Therefore, the incidence of arrhythmias, including benign ones that do not require therapeutic intervention, increases. Arrhythmia is the most common cardiovascular event observed in pregnant women, especially during the second trimester (14th to 27th week) to the third trimester (28th week) of pregnancy.
982
 Sinus arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, and supraventricular/ventricular extrasystoles are frequently observed, even in normal pregnancy.
983
 In addition, many pregnant and postpartum women complain of palpitations and dizziness, but these are not always caused by arrhythmia.
984

Pregnant women with a history of arrhythmia before pregnancy are more likely to relapse during the perinatal period. Especially, a pregnancy complicated with AF and/or atrial flutter needs careful attention because the risks of neonatal complications, such as preterm birth and low birth weight, have been reported as high.
985
, 
986
 Catheter ablation or device implantation before pregnancy is preferred in women with this indication.

Most treatments for arrhythmia during pregnancy are those given in the non‐pregnant condition, but it is necessary to select drugs while considering the effect on the fetus (Table 73). As a point to note, because it is difficult to carry out a safety test of drug treatment in pregnant or lactating women, the description in the package insert and the experience in actual clinical use are sometimes dissociated. In this guideline, following the previous guidelines, a comprehensive evaluation of the use of antiarrhythmic agents during pregnancy was performed.
987
, 
988
 Please note that some of the recommendations are different from those in the package insert. A β‐blocker can be administered (only when the benefit exceeds the risk), with consideration for side effects on the baby, such as intrauterine growth retardation.
987

Safety of Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Pregnant and Lactating Women

Amiodarone should be avoided as much as possible during pregnancy because of its effects on the fetal thyroid gland, but not in cases of low cardiac function and high risk for sudden death. Because amiodarone has a high rate of transfer to breast milk, breastfeeding is not recommended.

Superior ventricular/ventricular extrasystole occurs very often during pregnancy, in women with and without organic heart disease.
983
, 
984
 Many are asymptomatic and do not require treatment; but if symptoms are severe, or if they are associated with paroxysmal AF or hypofunction of the heart, drug treatment should be considered.

During pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is the main focus, and the drugs used are the same as when non‐pregnant. For reentrant supraventricular tachycardia that persists even after attempting the Valsalva procedure, adenosine has no placental crossing and does not affect the fetus, so can be safely used.
988
, 
989
 In severe cases, group I drugs for Wolf‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome. β‐blockers and verapamil, for cases other than WPW syndrome, are effective for prevention in severe cases.
988
 Because ectopic atrial tachycardia causes tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, if it is difficult to return to sinus rhythm, use a β‐blocker, verapamil or digoxin to control the heart rate. If heart rate control is inadequate, consider ablation treatment in a specialized facility.
988

AF in pregnant women with structural heart disease is more likely to occur between the 20th and 30th weeks of gestation, and maternal mortality and rates of fetal complications are high.
986
 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as upstream treatment are contraindicated after the second trimester of pregnancy. AF in pregnant women without structural heart disease is rare, and differential diagnosis for hyperthyroidism or electrolyte abnormalities is necessary.

Heart rate control is the main focus for persistent AF. Electrical cardioversion is selected when hemodynamics are unstable or when heart failure is exacerbated by the continuation of tachycardia. Pharmacotherapy for the purpose of preventing recurrence is similar to that administered during non‐pregnancy, but attention should be paid to arrhythmogenic and negative inotropic effects.
987
 Amiodarone should be replaced with other antiarrhythmic drugs as much as possible, and minimum use should be observed.

Anticoagulant therapy is performed according to the risk of thromboembolism during non‐pregnancy.
21
 In a pregnant woman needing anticoagulation for AF, heparin use is recommended because warfarin has a great risk for the fetus. The safety of direct oral anticoagulants during pregnancy has not been well established.
988

Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (outflow tract origin or verapamil‐sensitive VT) may be present during pregnancy, but many cases are associated with organic heart disease. Clinically significant VT occurs in 1–2% of pregnancies with organic heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy, with the most frequent occurrence in the third trimester of pregnancy. In cases of VT, maternal death, neonatal death, premature birth and low birth weight are more common.
990
 If hemodynamics are unstable, emergency cardioversion should be performed. If stable, oral treatment with β‐blockers, verapamil, sotalol or other antiarrhythmic drugs is recommended.
850
 Severe cases may require an ICD. However, its application should be carefully considered for ventricular arrhythmias associated with peripartum cardiomyopathy, in which cases cardiac function often recovers.
991
, 
992

In congenital long QT syndrome, especially type 2, postpartum arrhythmic events are more common than during pregnancy, and β‐blockers are effective in avoiding such events.
993
, 
994
 Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia may be exacerbated during pregnancy with increased sympathetic activity, so use of β‐blockers and flecainide is recommended. In Brugada syndrome, pregnancy is not reported to increase arrhythmic events.
995
, 
996

Because heart rate tends to increase during pregnancy, pregnancy and childbirth in women with bradycardia, but without pacemaker indication before pregnancy, often end without complications. However, because sympathetic nerve activity can decrease postpartum, careful attention is needed for prevention of bradycardia exacerbation.
997

### Superior Ventricular Extrasystole / Ventricular Extrasystole

Superior ventricular/ventricular extrasystole occurs very often during pregnancy, in women with and without organic heart disease.
983
, 
984
 Many are asymptomatic and do not require treatment; but if symptoms are severe, or if they are associated with paroxysmal AF or hypofunction of the heart, drug treatment should be considered.

### Supraventricular Tachycardia

During pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is the main focus, and the drugs used are the same as when non‐pregnant. For reentrant supraventricular tachycardia that persists even after attempting the Valsalva procedure, adenosine has no placental crossing and does not affect the fetus, so can be safely used.

 In severe cases, group I drugs for Wolf‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome. β‐blockers and verapamil, for cases other than WPW syndrome, are effective for prevention in severe cases.
988
 Because ectopic atrial tachycardia causes tachycardia‐induced cardiomyopathy, if it is difficult to return to sinus rhythm, use a β‐blocker, verapamil or digoxin to control the heart rate. If heart rate control is inadequate, consider ablation treatment in a specialized facility.

### Atrial Fibrillation / Atrial Flutter

AF in pregnant women with structural heart disease is more likely to occur between the 20th and 30th weeks of gestation, and maternal mortality and rates of fetal complications are high.
986
 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as upstream treatment are contraindicated after the second trimester of pregnancy. AF in pregnant women without structural heart disease is rare, and differential diagnosis for hyperthyroidism or electrolyte abnormalities is necessary.

Heart rate control is the main focus for persistent AF. Electrical cardioversion is selected when hemodynamics are unstable or when heart failure is exacerbated by the continuation of tachycardia. Pharmacotherapy for the purpose of preventing recurrence is similar to that administered during non‐pregnancy, but attention should be paid to arrhythmogenic and negative inotropic effects.
987
 Amiodarone should be replaced with other antiarrhythmic drugs as much as possible, and minimum use should be observed.

Anticoagulant therapy is performed according to the risk of thromboembolism during non‐pregnancy.

 In a pregnant woman needing anticoagulation for AF, heparin use is recommended because warfarin has a great risk for the fetus. The safety of direct oral anticoagulants during pregnancy has not been well established.

### Ventricular Tachycardia

Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (outflow tract origin or verapamil‐sensitive VT) may be present during pregnancy, but many cases are associated with organic heart disease. Clinically significant VT occurs in 1–2% of pregnancies with organic heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy, with the most frequent occurrence in the third trimester of pregnancy. In cases of VT, maternal death, neonatal death, premature birth and low birth weight are more common.
990
 If hemodynamics are unstable, emergency cardioversion should be performed. If stable, oral treatment with β‐blockers, verapamil, sotalol or other antiarrhythmic drugs is recommended.
850
 Severe cases may require an ICD. However, its application should be carefully considered for ventricular arrhythmias associated with peripartum cardiomyopathy, in which cases cardiac function often recovers.

### Inherited Arrhythmias

In congenital long QT syndrome, especially type 2, postpartum arrhythmic events are more common than during pregnancy, and β‐blockers are effective in avoiding such events.
993
, 
994
 Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia may be exacerbated during pregnancy with increased sympathetic activity, so use of β‐blockers and flecainide is recommended. In Brugada syndrome, pregnancy is not reported to increase arrhythmic events.
995
, 
996

### Bradycardia

Because heart rate tends to increase during pregnancy, pregnancy and childbirth in women with bradycardia, but without pacemaker indication before pregnancy, often end without complications. However, because sympathetic nerve activity can decrease postpartum, careful attention is needed for prevention of bradycardia exacerbation.
