## Neonatal death of siblings with Uhl’s disease and KCNH2 mutation - A rare association

### Abstract

ABSTRACTUhl’s disease is a rare disorder secondary to the uncontrolled destruction of right ventricular myocytes during the perinatal period. We present here the case of a 1-month-old child who died suddenly of Uhl’s disease, which was only diagnosed at autopsy and histological examination. From an anamnestic point of view, the child’s sister had also died at about 1 month of age from the same pathology. In both cases, genetic tests showed a heterozygous mutation in the KCNH2 gene. The case that we presented is particularly significant as very few familial cases of Uhl disease have been described in the literature, and genetic analyses have been conducted in very few cases. It is possible that the observed mutation played a role in the onset of the disease process. However, further scientific studies with larger case series are needed to confirm our results.

### INTRODUCTION

Uhl’s disease is a pathological condition characterized by congenital hypoplasia of the right ventricle (RV) myocardium.[1] The occurrence is very rare and, in many cases, is diagnosed after birth due to symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia.[2]

We present here the case of a 1-month-old child who died suddenly due to Uhl’s disease, which was only diagnosed postmortem by autopsy. The child’s sister had also died at about 1 month of age from the same pathology. In both cases, genetic tests showed a heterozygous mutation in the KCNH2 gene.

### CASE REPORT

A 30-day-old infant was found lifeless by his mother. After prolonged and unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the infant was declared dead. The baby weighed 2210 g at birth with an APGAR score of 9. From an anamnestic point of view, the baby was born by cesarean section at 36 weeks due to intrauterine growth retardation.

The baby had diarrhea and poor feeding in the absence of fever a few days before the event. With regard to the family history, a sister had died at the age of 1 month from suspected Uhl’s disease, diagnosed by radiological examination when the child was still alive, and no autopsy was performed. The sister’s genetic analysis described three different mutations in the DSP and DMD gene and another mutation in heterozygosity in the KCNH2 gene.

In the present case’s autopsy, the heart was irregularly shaped due to dilatation and deflation of the RV, prominence of the atrium and ipsilateral auricle, increased volume, and decreased consistency in the RV [Figure 1a and b]. The RV profile was irregular, with areas of juxtaposition of the endocardium to the pericardium. Macroscopically, no pathological abnormalities were detected in other organs.

Macroscopic findings. (a) Collapse of the right ventricular chamber; the wall is not supported by muscle fibers. (b) Short-axis cut of the heart; dilatation of the left ventricular chamber and the right ventricle with collapsed and thin walls (arrow)

Histopathological examination revealed the absence of the RV myocardium [Figure 2a and b]. On the histological section, a thrombus was adhered to the ventricle wall. Immunohistochemical reaction with desmin antibodies was negative in the RV [Figure 2c and d] with loose connective tissue in which isolated muscle fibrocells were present. The left ventricle appeared normal.

Microscopic findings. (a) Histological section with panoramic view of the interventricular septum characterized by a rich muscular component in the left ventricle and an absence of muscular cells and fibers in the wall of the right ventricle (×2). (b) Histological section of the right ventricle with thrombus in organization attached to the endocardium (×10) (arrow). (c and d) Immunohistochemistry with antidesmin antibodies showing the muscular component of the left ventricle and the absence in the right ventricle (×10), (×40)

Genetic analysis was performed by new generation sequence (NGS) sequencing of coding genomic regions and exon–intron junctions (5 nt) using WES_v1 Extended Esome kit (SOPHiA Genetics) on the NextSeq platform (Illumina). Data analysis was performed using SOPHiA DDM software (ILL1XG1G4_CNV_exome pipeline) and Sanger sequencing for confirmation of any pathogenic variants identified. Analytical sensitivity and specificity of Sanger sequencing are >99%.

The NGS technique allows deletions/duplications (copy number variations [CNVs]) to be identified in the regions analyzed with SOPHiA DDM software in 90% of the genes included in the kit (minimum resolution 4–5 exons). A real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm possible CNVs.

The search for possible variants associated with sudden infant death syndrome and cardiac alterations (code 21-ESO-0081) was performed.

The results showed a heterozygous variant C1747A > G in the KCNH2 gene (NM_00238). This variant, present in dbSNP (rs199473427), is described in association with autosomal dominant long QT syndrome type 2.[3]

### DISCUSSION

The pathogenesis of Uhl’s disease is related to a defect in the embryonic development of the right heart with a genetic substrate.[4] However, further studies[5] did not confirm this hypothesis: the RV does not originate from a single cardiogenic fold, and myocardial destruction appears to occur after the heart is already well developed.[2] There are no proven genetic mutations associated with Uhl’s anomaly.[6]

In the case, we presented, the 30-day-old infant suddenly presented with cardio-respiratory arrest and was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Surprisingly, an echocardiogram (performed when the infant was 10 days old) did not reveal any abnormalities of the RV.

There was a significant family history of a similar diagnosis in the sibling. A few years earlier, the parents had had a little girl who had died of heart failure due to Uhl’s disease at the age of 1 month. In this case, the genetic analysis described three different mutations involving the DSP gene, the DMD gene (linked to the X chromosome associated with muscular dystrophy), and another mutation in heterozygosity in the KCNH2 gene. This mutation is generally related to long QT syndrome, but it could also play a role in the genesis of this disease.

The case that we presented is particularly significant as very few familial cases of Uhl’s disease have been described in the literature, and genetic analyses have been carried out in very few cases. Only exceptionally this anomaly been described in identical twins[7] and in a familial pattern.[48]

This familial case could suggest that Uhl’s disease is a disorder with a genetic substratum. A mutation in the KCHN2 gene was found in both cases. Therefore, the question is whether this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is possible that the observed mutation played a role in the onset of the disease process. However, further scientific studies with larger case series are needed to confirm our results.

Therefore, we urge the performance of both clinical and forensic genetic tests that can confirm the presence of genetic mutations related to Uhl’s anomaly. This could also allow for prenatal screening, which could thus lead to earlier diagnosis and better infant survival.

We can also assume that two conditions (i.e., long QT2 and Uhl’s anomaly) coexisted in the siblings. Since there are no previous reports to link KCNH2 mutations with Uhl’s anomaly, this would only be a variant of uncertain significance in the present clinical case. Very few genes which might be classified as variants of uncertain significance are actually reclassified as pathogenic. However, the sudden death could be ascribed to the KCNH2 mutation.

From an autopsy point of view, the thorough multidisciplinary approach has clarified the cause of death. We emphasize the need for a careful and comprehensive multidisciplinary approach in cases of infant death. From a clinical point of view, early diagnosis is essential to avoid the onset of heart failure, identify cases requiring surgical intervention and increase the infant’s chances of survival.
