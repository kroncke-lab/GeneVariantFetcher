    "extraction_summary": "The paper discusses the creation of an hERG-deficient human cardiomyocyte model using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the KCNH2 gene. No specific genetic variants in KCNH2 are reported in terms of cDNA or protein notation. The study focuses on the functional impact of complete gene knockout rather than individual variants."
