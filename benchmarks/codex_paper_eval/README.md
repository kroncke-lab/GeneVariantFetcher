# Extraction-blinded paper evaluation

This harness compares paper-reading protocols on a fixed, gold-value-blinded
cardiac paper set. `prepare` may use gold only to determine PMID eligibility and
whether all three count fields have assertions. Extraction is finalized and
locked before `score` reads any gold value or row count.

## Fully traced run

```bash
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/run_eval.py prepare \
  --seed 2026072301 \
  --paper-manifest benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/highcarrier_48_papers_20260723.tsv \
  --run-id my_traced_run

.venv/bin/python benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/run_eval.py extract \
  --run-dir benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/runs/my_traced_run \
  --model gpt-5.6-sol

.venv/bin/python benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/run_eval.py lock \
  --run-dir benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/runs/my_traced_run

.venv/bin/python benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/run_eval.py score \
  --run-dir benchmarks/codex_paper_eval/runs/my_traced_run
```

Every paper gets exact route/extraction call traces and explicit route/final
decision events under `llm_traces/<GENE>/<PMID>/`. The trace manifest is inside
the pre-gold lock and is revalidated during scoring. The self-contained
`llm_trace_report.html` is generated automatically and locked alongside it;
open that file directly in a browser to review the run paper by paper. See
[`../../docs/LLM_TRACING.md`](../../docs/LLM_TRACING.md) for the trace contract
and adjudication workflow.

Runs made before trace schema v2 cannot be treated as exact request/response
audits. Their final predictions and rationales remain useful, but rerunning the
fixed manifest is required to produce authentic raw call traces.
