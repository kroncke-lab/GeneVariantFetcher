# Codex extraction-blinded paper evaluation — `20260902_zero_claim_guard_gold118`

## Technical summary

This hash-locked run evaluated **118 papers** (**per-gene counts {'SCN5A': 30, 'KCNH2': 28, 'KCNQ1': 30, 'RYR2': 30}**) after selecting only PMIDs with downloaded source and gold assertions for carriers, affected, and unaffected. Codex predictions were finalized before scoring.

- Variant precision **66.0%**, recall **86.4%**, F1 **74.8%** (546 TP, 281 FP, 86 FN).
- Precision versus counted extras **97.7%** (546 matched rows; 13 extra rows with patient counts). The stricter count-bearing-only diagnostic is **94.4%** and has a different numerator; it is not comparable to the repository's counted-extra precision floor.
- Exact API telemetry: **2,741,760 total tokens** (1,981,115 input; 760,645 output).
- Elapsed: **8708.0s wall clock**; 7811.9s summed per-paper route + read time.
- Notation twins merged before scoring: **1** same-paper prediction rows that were the same variant in another notation (equivalent-allele identity only; ambiguous or count-conflicting rows were left separate).
- Representation choices: {'text': 118}.

## Blinding and scorer audit

- Paper selection used the fixed manifest `tier2_gold_120.tsv` (118 papers) from the downloaded-source, gold-count-eligible pool. Routing, extraction, counts, evidence, and source locations were gold-value-blind.
- Blinding: gold was used only for PMID eligibility and count-field presence during selection; extraction exported no gold values or row counts, and predictions were locked before `score` opened gold.

## Count fidelity

Count recall is the share of all gold count assertions for which the locked prediction supplied a value; MAE/RMSE are computed only where both gold and prediction supplied a value.

| field | supplied / gold assertions | count recall | MAE | RMSE |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| carriers | 216 / 632 | 34.2% | 0.162 | 0.663 |
| affected | 133 / 632 | 21.0% | 0.429 | 2.233 |
| unaffected | 32 / 631 | 5.1% | 1.719 | 7.852 |

Gold encodes "no such individuals reported" as an explicit 0 while the pipeline deliberately abstains with NULL, so pooled count recall mixes that convention gap with real attribution misses. The stratified view separates them; the non-zero column is the actionable attribution number.

| field | non-zero gold: supplied / asserted | non-zero recall | zero gold: supplied / asserted | zero recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| carriers | 212 / 472 | 44.9% | 4 / 160 | 2.5% |
| affected | 116 / 406 | 28.6% | 17 / 226 | 7.5% |
| unaffected | 18 / 82 | 22.0% | 14 / 549 | 2.6% |

## Scope, method, and limitations

- Population: fixed manifest `tier2_gold_120.tsv` (118 papers); per-gene counts {'SCN5A': 30, 'KCNH2': 28, 'KCNQ1': 30, 'RYR2': 30}; every PMID has downloaded source and at least one gold assertion in each count field.
- Blinding: gold was used only for PMID eligibility and count-field presence during selection; extraction exported no gold values or row counts, and predictions were locked before `score` opened gold.
- Variant metrics are micro-averaged over gold rows. Precision treats unmatched predictions as false positives, although the curated recall packet may omit some real variants.
- Count MAE/RMSE are conditional on a supplied value. Count recall must be read alongside them because abstentions and missed variants are excluded from error magnitude.
- Source acquisition and gold completeness are separate from model reading quality; abstract-only or incomplete source is retained and labeled rather than silently excluded.
- The audited notation score is primary; the preserved raw score bounds sensitivity to post-lock matching adjudication.

## Reproducibility and evidence

- `selection.json`: selected PMIDs, source paths, source hashes, and available representations.
- `predictions.json`: immutable per-paper tools, rationales, extracted variants, counts, evidence quotes, source locations, and telemetry when captured.
- The production `gvf-run` trace manifest for every gene, including its exact call/decision records and write-time digest index, is SHA-256-bound in `predictions.json` and `LOCK.json` and revalidated before scoring.
- Each source run retains its own `llm_traces/<GENE>/<PMID>/` records and `llm_trace_report.html`; the evaluation projection does not copy or relabel those run-scoped records.
- `evidence.csv`: flat evidence ledger for every predicted variant.
- `paper_metrics.csv`: exact per-paper metrics.
- `LOCK.json`: SHA-256 digests proving prediction finalization before scoring.
- `report.json`: complete machine-readable score, errors, timing, and token usage.
- Phenotype-count recovery figure and inspectable source data: `figures/phenotype_count_recovery.svg`, `figures/phenotype_count_recovery.png`, `figures/phenotype_count_recovery.pdf`, `figures/data/phenotype_count_recovery.csv`, `figures/data/phenotype_count_recovery.json`.
- `matcher_adjudication.csv`: post-lock notation-equivalence audit; no extraction was edited.
- `report_raw_matcher.json` and `report_raw_matcher.md`: preserved pre-adjudication score.
- `validation_notes.md`: independent arithmetic, integrity checks, failure concentration, count outliers, and Claude comparison.
- `model_comparison.csv`: compact Codex/Claude comparison with scorer and telemetry caveats.
- `report_queries.sql`: executable DuckDB queries for the bounded analytical report datasets.

## Recommended next steps

1. Adjudicate extra predictions against the paper before treating precision as a production false-positive rate.
2. Review count outliers by source location and distinguish model mistakes from gold disagreements.
3. Add automatic fallback routing for data-rich papers that return zero or very few variants, then repeat with the same lock and count-recall definitions.

## Further questions

- Does table/PDF/OCR routing improve recall enough to justify its additional routing-call tokens?
- How much of the residual error is source incompleteness versus count-role interpretation?
