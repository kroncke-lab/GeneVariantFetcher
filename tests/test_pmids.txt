# GeneVariantFetcher Test PMIDs
# Generated 2026-01-25
#
# These PMIDs represent various failure modes for testing extraction improvements.
# Each category targets a specific issue type.

# =============================================================================
# CATEGORY 1: COMPLETE MISS - No extraction file exists (25 PMIDs)
# These papers have variants in curated Excel but zero extraction output.
# Root cause: Full-text retrieval failed (PDF conversion, HTML artifacts, etc.)
# =============================================================================
15840476  # 86 variants expected - Tester 2005 "Compendium of cardiac channel mutations"
10973849  # 59 variants expected - Splawski 2000 "Spectrum of mutations in long-QT syndrome genes"
26496715  # 53 variants expected - Gao 2016 "Common Genotypes of Long QT Syndrome in China"
11854117  # 44 variants expected - Moss 2002 "Increased risk of arrhythmic events in long-QT syndrome"
19038855  # 28 variants expected
14661677  # 25 variants expected
29650123  # 22 variants expected
16922724  # 20 variants expected
17905336  # 11 variants expected
19996378  # 9 variants expected
27871843  # 9 variants expected

21216356  # 8 variants expected
22727609  # 8 variants expected
15176425  # 7 variants expected
14998624  # 7 variants expected
24103226  # 7 variants expected
28532774  # 6 variants expected

19843919  # 5 variants expected
29759541  # 5 variants expected
29766883  # 5 variants expected

# =============================================================================
# CATEGORY 2: PARTIAL EXTRACTION - Some variants found, many missing (5 PMIDs)
# Extraction ran and found SOME variants, but missed many others.
# Root cause: Large tables truncated, supplements not fully parsed, gene filtering
# =============================================================================
24606995  # 1 found, 27 missing - Danish LQTS study, "64 mutations in 70 families"
24667783  # 2 found, 21 missing
23098067  # 2 found, 20 missing
29622001  # 19 found, 16 missing - Good partial extraction, missing frameshifts
24217263  # 1 found, 3 missing

# =============================================================================
# CATEGORY 3: COUNT MISMATCHES - Variants found but carrier counts differ (10 PMIDs)
# Extraction identified correct variants but penetrance/carrier counts are wrong.
# Root cause: Family vs proband counting, cohort aggregation, assay confusion
# =============================================================================
9544837   # 5 count mismatches
12442276  # 3 count mismatches
26823142  # 3 count mismatches
18808722  # 3 count mismatches - A490T: Excel=7, SQLite=2
20181576  # 2 count mismatches
26066609  # 2 count mismatches
22338672  # 2 count mismatches
28491588  # 2 count mismatches
29146210  # 2 count mismatches
18551196  # count mismatch - A558P: Excel=3, SQLite=2

# =============================================================================
# CATEGORY 4: WRONG VARIANTS EXTRACTED - Extraction ran but found wrong variants (10 PMIDs)
# Paper is in database, but extracted variants don't match Excel at all.
# Root cause: Gene confusion (KCNQ1 vs KCNH2), variant nomenclature mismatch
# =============================================================================
