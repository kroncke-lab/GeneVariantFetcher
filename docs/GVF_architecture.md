# GVF Architecture (Pointer)

This file is intentionally lightweight.

The canonical architecture documentation lives in:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Use that file for:
- pipeline stage definitions
- module responsibilities
- extension points and integration behavior

If you are updating architecture docs, update only `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and keep this pointer file unchanged.
