## Germline DNA-Repair Genes and HOXB13 Mutations in Korean Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Data from a Large Korean Cohort

### Abstract

PurposeGermline mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes such as BRCA2 have been associated with prostate cancer (PC) risk but has not been thoroughly evaluated for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) in Asian men. This study attempts to evaluate frequency of DDR mutations in the largest cohort of Koreans.Materials and MethodsWe recruited 340 patients with mPC unselected for family history of cancer and compared to 495 controls. Whole genome sequencing was applied to assess germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPVs) in 26 DDR genes and HOXB13, including 7 genes (ATM, BRCA1/2, CHEK2, BRIP1, PALB2, and NBN) associated with hereditary PC. Comparisons to published Caucasian and Japanese cohorts were performed.ResultsTotal of 28 PV/LPVs were identified in 30 (8.8%) patients; mutations were found in 13 genes, including BRCA2 (15 men [4.41%]), ATM (2 men [0.59%]), NBN (2 men [0.59%], and BRIP1 (2 men [0.59%]). Only one patient had HOXB13 mutation (0.29%). A lower rate of overall germline variant frequency was observed in Korean mPC compared to Caucasians (8.8% vs. 11.8%), but individual variants notably differed from Caucasian and geographically similar Japanese cohorts. PV/LPVs in DDR genes tended to increase gradually with higher Gleason scores (GS 7, 7.1%; GS 8, 7.5%; GS 9–10, 9.9%).ConclusionsBRCA2 was the most frequently mutated gene common to different cohorts supporting its importance, but differences in variant distribution in Korean mPC underscore the need for ethnic-specific genetic models. Future ethnic-specific analyses are warranted to verify our findings.

### INTRODUCTION

With considerable advances in identifying risk variants in the genomic landscape of prostate cancer (PC), germline mutation in nominal genes have garnered interest for prediction of cancer prognosis and treatment response. As such, recent guidelines instruct implementation of germline screening in men with high familial risk or early onset of PC based on results from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [1]. Currently, genetic factors contribute to approximately 5% to 15% of all PC cases, especially in carriers of rare pathogenic mutations (RPMs) in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 [2]. Such patients with either germline or somatic pathogenic variants (PVs) show differential response to treatment and have aggressive forms of the disease. With the approval of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as Olaparib in castration-resistant PC with BRCA mutation either germline and/or somatic, identification of such DDR mutations may provide a chance of early therapy.

Amidst evidence that support genetic testing to identify high-risk patients and guide eligibility for active surveillance as well as provide individualized methods of treatment based on genomic imprints, reports on germline mutation of risk variants for PC in Asian population are limited. Multi-ethnic based GWAS summary statistics are conducted primarily in Caucasian and European men, and large proportions of PC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lack significance when compared to East Asian cohorts [3]. Men of Asian ancestry were found to have differential levels of SNP-based composite genetic risk scores compared to African and European men when using the same risk variants [1], implying the need for ethnic-specific analysis to achieve robust performance suitable for clinical implementation. Metastatic PC (mPC) in Asians deserve further evaluation, not only due to the increase in incidence but also due to Asian men harboring more adverse phenotypes [4]. The objective of this study was to identify the frequency of germline mutation in DDR genes & highly penetrant HOXB13 in patients with mPC in Korean populations.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical variables including age at diagnosis and metastasis, initial PSA, and Gleason score (GS) were included. Histopathologic analysis was based on sextant transrectal ultrasound or MRI-fusion targeted biopsy as well as transurethral prostatectomy specimen, and radical prostatectomy (RP)-proven pathologic staging and grade were used when available. Total 340 patients treated or undergoing treatment for any mPC were included, defined as metastasis outside the prostate to lymph nodes, bone, and other organs. All mPC patients were recruited from a single tertiary hospital as part of a prospective biobank collected in all PC patients collected at initial presentation or at identification of metastatic status (de novo, progression, or recurrence). Allele frequency for healthy controls were obtained from 2 multicenter databases, Korean Variome Center (KoVariome) and Ulsan 10K Genomes Project (U10K). Total 495 healthy male controls were used (n=145 from KoVariome and n=350 from U10K), defined as male over 40 with no history of any cancer.

Patient recruit and clinical data collection was conducted at from a single tertiary medical center (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital) as a prospective biobank approved by the Institutional Review Board (B-167/355-302). Informed consent was obtained for all subjects diagnosed for PC between 2008 and 2021.

Selection of DDR genes were based on 20 genes from the pivotal study by Prichard et al [2], including ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, GEN, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, RAD61C, RAD51D, and XRCC2. HOXB13 with 6 additional PC-associated DDR genes proven in previous literature (BLM, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCA, RAD51B, RAD54L) were further included. HOXB13, a well-known tumor suppressor gene implicated in PC pathogenesis, was included as per recommendation for its inclusion in recent guidelines for germline testing. Whole genome sequencing was performed using DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform (MGI-Tech, Shenzhen, China), with 150 bp (base pair) read length and average 38× depth of coverage. Samples were obtained from both saliva (n=11) and blood (n=329) and DNA extracted per manufacturer instructions. Reads were aligned to human reference genome GRCh38 (hg38) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) [5], after quality filtration of raw FASTQ sequencing with FastQC and adapter sequence trimming with Cutadapt [6] (Supplement Fig. 1). Fastp [7] quality filter were applied prior to alignment, and duplicate reads were removed with Picard v2.21.8 [8]. GATK4 was used for Base Quality Score Recalibration and variant calling [9]. Annotations of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and indel (insertion-deletion mutations) were identified using SnpEff [10], and structural variants (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) using Lumpy [11] and CNVnator [12] frameworks, respectively. PVs and likely PVs (LPVs) for SNV and indels were further annotated using the ClinVar database (ver. 20211120) [13]. Slightly low mapping rates when DNA was extracted via saliva (Supplement Fig. 2), but no significant differences were observed in overall analysis.

Association and odds ratio (OR) for case-controls and inter-cohort comparisons were conducted with Fisher’s exact and logistic regression analysis, respectively. Cochran-Armitage test was used for trend. All tests were two-sided with p-value less than 0.05 considered significant unless quoted otherwise. Statistical tests were performed using the R package (ver. 4.0.5).

### 2. Ethics statement

Patient recruit and clinical data collection was conducted at from a single tertiary medical center (Seoul National University Bundang Hospital) as a prospective biobank approved by the Institutional Review Board (B-167/355-302). Informed consent was obtained for all subjects diagnosed for PC between 2008 and 2021.

### 3. Sequencing, variant calling & annotation

Selection of DDR genes were based on 20 genes from the pivotal study by Prichard et al [2], including ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, GEN, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, RAD61C, RAD51D, and XRCC2. HOXB13 with 6 additional PC-associated DDR genes proven in previous literature (BLM, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCA, RAD51B, RAD54L) were further included. HOXB13, a well-known tumor suppressor gene implicated in PC pathogenesis, was included as per recommendation for its inclusion in recent guidelines for germline testing. Whole genome sequencing was performed using DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform (MGI-Tech, Shenzhen, China), with 150 bp (base pair) read length and average 38× depth of coverage. Samples were obtained from both saliva (n=11) and blood (n=329) and DNA extracted per manufacturer instructions. Reads were aligned to human reference genome GRCh38 (hg38) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-MEM) [5], after quality filtration of raw FASTQ sequencing with FastQC and adapter sequence trimming with Cutadapt [6] (Supplement Fig. 1). Fastp [7] quality filter were applied prior to alignment, and duplicate reads were removed with Picard v2.21.8 [8]. GATK4 was used for Base Quality Score Recalibration and variant calling [9]. Annotations of single nucleotide variant (SNV) and indel (insertion-deletion mutations) were identified using SnpEff [10], and structural variants (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) using Lumpy [11] and CNVnator [12] frameworks, respectively. PVs and likely PVs (LPVs) for SNV and indels were further annotated using the ClinVar database (ver. 20211120) [13]. Slightly low mapping rates when DNA was extracted via saliva (Supplement Fig. 2), but no significant differences were observed in overall analysis.

### 4. Statistical analysis

Association and odds ratio (OR) for case-controls and inter-cohort comparisons were conducted with Fisher’s exact and logistic regression analysis, respectively. Cochran-Armitage test was used for trend. All tests were two-sided with p-value less than 0.05 considered significant unless quoted otherwise. Statistical tests were performed using the R package (ver. 4.0.5).

### RESULTS

Median age at diagnosis and metastasis for patients with mPC were 68 and 71 years old, respectively (Supplement Table 1). Median PSA was 37.6±507.1 ng/mL, with 8.4% GS 7 (3+4 or 4+3), 28.2% GS 8, and 63.4% GS 9 or higher. Of all patients, 127 (37.4%) were de novo mPC with no previous treatment, whereas 212 (62.4%) were recurrent mPC (progressed from localized disease) with overt metastases detected at imaging (32.1%) or suspected for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after initial treatment with potential micro-metastases (30.3%). Family history was collected in 285 participants, of whom only 15 (5.3%) had a positive family history. Nodal metastasis was identified in 48 (14.1%) patients who underwent RP.

Results from the ClinVar annotation statistics for 26 DDR genes and HOXB13 are found in Table 1. Total 1,442 single nucleotide variants and 376 indels were identified, with the vast majority of variants corresponding to benign (BV), likely-benign (LBV) or unknown significance (VUS). Six SNVs and 11 indels were classified as PV/LPV, constituting 0.42% and 3.2% of all SNVs and indels, respectively. Six stop-gain and frameshift variants not identified from ClinVar were putatively considered as PV/LPVs and included in downstream analysis, and categorization conducted through InterVar [14] based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline [15] has been further noted in Table 2. Of all patients, 30 (8.8%) harbored total 28 PV/LPVs in 13 out of 20 genes (Table 2). Twenty-five variations were SNV and indels, and 3 variations were large deletions corresponding to CNVs and SVs. BRCA2 variants were most commonly observed (4.41%), followed by ATM, BRIP1, NBN (each 0.59%), and BRCA1, FAM175A, GEN1, MSH6, PMS2, RAD51C, and RAD51D (each 0.29%) (Table 3, Fig. 1).

CNV and SV analysis indicated 3 large putatively pathogenic deletions in PMS2, F AM175A, and RAD51C (Table 2, Supplement Fig. 3, 4, 5). In the patient with PMS2 mutation, copy number deletion was found in exons 13 and 14 with about 3 kbp deletion in a homozygous pattern (2 copy loss). FAM175A and RAD51C showed deletions in exons 6–9 to 3’ untranslated region (UTR) and exons 4–7, respectively, with both heterozygous deletion profiles (single copy loss). Small 30 to 40 bp deletions in the intron region of BRCA2 were identified, located at the 13th and 23rd introns in 3 and 11 patient samples, respectively.

Sub-analysis for variant frequency and clinicopathologic correlation showed a positive trend for increasing GS, with germline mutations in 7% and 10% of GS ≤7 and ≥9 patients, respectively (Fig. 2). Although statistical significance for trend was not achieved (p=0.47), the results confirm previous findings [16] that the frequency of PV/LPV increase with GS, suggesting that the degree of aggressiveness may be higher in men with pathogenic germline mutations.

Analysis of Korean healthy males (n=495) revealed 9 (1.8%) mutation variants in BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, ATR, CHEK2, MLH1, and MSH2 in decreasing order (Table 3). BRCA2 mutation was significantly more likely to be present in Korean mPC compared to healthy counterparts (OR 11.37, p<0.001). ATM and BRCA1, considered PV for PC, was not significantly associated for increased risk for developing mPC (p=0.7 and 0.79, respectively). Further comparison to Caucasian mPC as reported by Pritchard et al [2] showed that while BRCA2 is the most frequently in both ethnicities (4.41% vs. 5.35% in Koreans and Caucasians, respectively), mutations in ATM and CHEK2 which displayed 2nd and 3rd highest frequency in Caucasian mPC were not found or had very low frequency in Koreans (0.59% & 0.0% vs. 1.59% & 1.45% in Koreans and Caucasians, respectively) (Table 3). Overall variant frequency was also ultimately lower in Koreans compared to Caucasians with no overlap of PV/LPV germline variants, underlying an ethnic difference in genetic predisposition for mPC.

To further assess the germline variant profile of DNA repair genes within the East-Asian ethnicity, Korean mPC was compared to the germline carrier frequency reported in a large Japanese cohort [17] (Supplement Table 2). Eight genes including BRCA1/2 and ATM were compared, with BRCA2 commonly found to be most frequent in both studies. However, BRCA2 frequency in the Korean mPC cohort was approximately 4-times higher than that of the Japanese cohort, with gene-based association test showing the most significant p-value in the BRCA2 gene with overall statistical significance. Only 1 patient had HOXB13 mutation (Gly132Glu), which was 2nd most frequent in Japanese.

### 1. Clinical characteristics

Median age at diagnosis and metastasis for patients with mPC were 68 and 71 years old, respectively (Supplement Table 1). Median PSA was 37.6±507.1 ng/mL, with 8.4% GS 7 (3+4 or 4+3), 28.2% GS 8, and 63.4% GS 9 or higher.

Family history was collected in 285 participants, of whom only 15 (5.3%) had a positive family history. Nodal metastasis was identified in 48 (14.1%) patients who underwent RP.

### 2. Germline variant mutation in DDR genes and HOXB13

Results from the ClinVar annotation statistics for 26 DDR genes and HOXB13 are found in Table 1. Total 1,442 single nucleotide variants and 376 indels were identified, with the vast majority of variants corresponding to benign (BV), likely-benign (LBV) or unknown significance (VUS). Six SNVs and 11 indels were classified as PV/LPV, constituting 0.42% and 3.2% of all SNVs and indels, respectively.

CNV and SV analysis indicated 3 large putatively pathogenic deletions in PMS2, F AM175A, and RAD51C (Table 2, Supplement Fig. 3, 4, 5). In the patient with PMS2 mutation, copy number deletion was found in exons 13 and 14 with about 3 kbp deletion in a homozygous pattern (2 copy loss). FAM175A and RAD51C showed deletions in exons 6–9 to 3’ untranslated region (UTR) and exons 4–7, respectively, with both heterozygous deletion profiles (single copy loss). Small 30 to 40 bp deletions in the intron region of BRCA2 were identified, located at the 13th and 23rd introns in 3 and 11 patient samples, respectively.

Although statistical significance for trend was not achieved (p=0.47), the results confirm previous findings [16] that the frequency of PV/LPV increase with GS, suggesting that the degree of aggressiveness may be higher in men with pathogenic germline mutations.

### 3. Comparison analysis to different cohorts

Analysis of Korean healthy males (n=495) revealed 9 (1.8%) mutation variants in BRCA2, ATM, BRCA1, ATR, CHEK2, MLH1, and MSH2 in decreasing order (Table 3). BRCA2 mutation was significantly more likely to be present in Korean mPC compared to healthy counterparts (OR 11.37, p<0.001). ATM and BRCA1, considered PV for PC, was not significantly associated for increased risk for developing mPC (p=0.7 and 0.79, respectively). Further comparison to Caucasian mPC as reported by Pritchard et al [2] showed that while BRCA2 is the most frequently in both ethnicities (4.41% vs. 5.35% in Koreans and Caucasians, respectively), mutations in ATM and CHEK2 which displayed 2nd and 3rd highest frequency in Caucasian mPC were not found or had very low frequency in Koreans (0.59% & 0.0% vs. 1.59% & 1.45% in Koreans and Caucasians, respectively) (Table 3). Overall variant frequency was also ultimately lower in Koreans compared to Caucasians with no overlap of PV/LPV germline variants, underlying an ethnic difference in genetic predisposition for mPC.

To further assess the germline variant profile of DNA repair genes within the East-Asian ethnicity, Korean mPC was compared to the germline carrier frequency reported in a large Japanese cohort [17] (Supplement Table 2). Eight genes including BRCA1/2 and ATM were compared, with BRCA2 commonly found to be most frequent in both studies. However, BRCA2 frequency in the Korean mPC cohort was approximately 4-times higher than that of the Japanese cohort, with gene-based association test showing the most significant p-value in the BRCA2 gene with overall statistical significance. Only 1 patient had HOXB13 mutation (Gly132Glu), which was 2nd most frequent in Japanese.

### DISCUSSION

Despite modifications in recent guidelines to support the use of genetic testing for assessment of germline mutations in men with high familial risk, evaluation amongst different racial and ethnic cohorts are lacking, with established literature suggesting varying genetic profiles depending on ancestry. Unlike previous studies in germline PC, we selected only men with proven metastatic cancer status to assess the linkage of germline DDR mutation with progression to mPC in the largest volume of Koreans to our knowledge. Approximately 9% of all mPC harbored at least one deleterious variant in DDR genes, with BRCA2 mutation most predominant. Three novel CNVs in PMS2, RAD51C, and FAM175A were identified, with higher GS patients showing a gradual increase in PV/LPV variant frequency. Comparison with healthy controls as well as Caucasian and Japanese cohorts indicate a distinct mutation profile in Korean mPC, further supporting the need for ethnic-specific appraisal of germline susceptibility in PC.

Germline mutations in DDR genes have especially been associated with increased risk for PC-mortality and early age at diagnosis [18] as well as GS reclassification during active surveillance [19], notably in BRCA1/2 and ATM carriers. Markedly high proportion of germline BRCA2 mutation in this study affirms previous literature suggesting localized BRCA2-mutant tumors harbor increased frequency of CNV than those without mutations [20]. Half of mutation carriers had variants in BRCA2, attesting to the hypothesis that BRCA2 aberrations may accelerate mutation as which occurs during hormone therapy, leading to aggressive, metastatic forms of the disease [21]. While BRCA1 and BRCA2 are both RPMs of importance as suggested in early literature, BRCA2 seems to play a more pivotal role in East Asian mPC. Study of germline PVs in more than 7000 Japanese patients [17] lay further support, as PC patients were 5.6 times more likely to harbor BRCA2 mutation (p<0.001) but failed to show statistical significance for BRCA1 (p=0.06). However, PV carriers had increased risk of aggressive (GS ≥8) tumors, which supports the upward trend for frequency of germline PVs from 7% in GS ≤7 to nearly 10% in GS ≥9 revealed from this study (Fig. 2).

Surprisingly, no overlap of individual variants was observed when compared to the Caucasian cohort [2], with considerable difference in overall distribution of RPMs. Overall germline variant carriers in Korean mPC were over 2-fold higher than in Japanese PC cohort (6.76% vs. 2.88%), but this can be attributed to the relatively low percentage of mPC (M1) patients included in the latter study (8.0%, n=297) [17]. Further comparison to 139 mPC from a UK biobank with all European ancestry found only 1 shared variant in BRCA2 (p.Thr3085fs) out of 22 PV identified [22]. Mutation in ATM and CHEK2, found in relatively high frequency in Caucasian mPC, did not show significant overlap in Korean mPC nor increased mPC risk compared to Korean healthy controls (OR 1.46, p=0.79), with CHEK2 mutation found only in a healthy male. Lack of RPM distribution overlap aside from BRCA2 suggest that while germline mutation in DDR substantially increases risk for mPC, different genomic factors may drive carcinogenesis depending on ethnicity. A recent meta-analysis of germline RPMs further suggest that amidst the myriad of gene panels recommended in current guidelines, only BRCA2, ATM, NBN, CHEK2, and PALB2 show significant association with PC progression to lethal or metastatic disease [23]. HOXB13, while associated with high PC risk in European and Caucasian cohorts, was found in only 1 Korean patient with mPC despite being the 2nd most frequently observed in Japanese PC [17]. Gly132Glu variant, classified as VUS in ClinVar, seems to be specific in East Asian and Korean men [24] and should be considered for ethnic-specific panels along with Gly135Glu. Difference in germline PV profiles even when compared to Japanese men of same East Asian ancestry provides evidence for a more tailored approach when assessing genetic risk, especially during the construction of risk scores from cancer-associated SNPs [25], as population-based scores tend to outperform generalized, multiethnic models [26].

While family history was collected in 285 participants (83.4%), only 5% had a positive history of PC. This suggests that while familial PC history may contribute to PC development and must be adequately screened for cascade testing, it may not influence oncologic severity and likelihood for metastasis. Association analysis conducted in a Japanese cohort with 473 men of BRCA1/2 family history further support this hypothesis [27], as familial BRCA mutations failed to show any correlation to GS ≥8 nor metastasis at diagnosis. Study of germline variants showed similar results, with family history failing to achieve statistical significance despite a relatively large sample size of combined 20,000 case and controls [17]. Only 9% in an earlier Korean study had 1st to 2nd degree family history of PC [24].

Of the 6 variants not reported in ClinVar, 4 were categorized as putative PV/LPV and 2 as VUS via InterVar (Table 3). Frameshift mutations considered VUS were absent from controls and potentially pathogenic based on the ACMG guidelines, but were found in GEN1 and RAD54L genes with little known mechanism of disease, and hence categorized as VUS. Interestingly, 30 to 40 bp mutations in the introns of BRCA2 were also identified in a relatively large portion of patients. The significance of such deletions in the 13th and 23rd introns are unknown, despite being found in 11 and 3 samples, respectively. Previous research has suggested that variants in the splicing site of intron 13 altered the maturation of mRNA and may play a role in breast and ovarian cancer [28], but no definite associations in PC can be made. However, intronic variants newly discovered from GWAS studies rather than conventional exome-based analyses have been linked to cellular signaling and differentiation that ultimately result in PC progression [29], and as such, these novel mutations may play a role in metastatic conversion. Also, the discovered intronic alterations may potentially correspond to transcription disruption and downstream loss-of-function in BRCA2 [28], though validation in large cohorts is required to assess functionality of such rare intronic variants. Findings from our research further support the need to study CNVs via whole-genome rather than exome-wide studies to evaluate whether these variants actually affect genomic pathogenesis in PC.

Our study is not without limitations. First, despite a relatively large cohort reported in Asian PC, the number of included participants in this study are modest to comprehensively represent populational burden and result in statistical significance. Also, this was a single institutional study, allowing the collection of well-conditioned data at the inevitable risk of selection bias. Lastly, comparison to a previous Korean study of germline PV shows identical mutations in only 2 out of 6 PVs (c.658_659delGT in BRCA2 and c.395G>A in HOXB13), most likely due to the lack of variant coverage in the sample population. However, as only 297 patients mPC patients were included in a previous analysis of East Asian PC and 30 men in the earlier Korean cohort, our study best represents germline mutation of mPC in East Asia. Also, novel CNVs were detected from this study, whose role in mPC pathogenesis need to be further discussed in future research. Patients with germline mutations should be carefully monitored and accurately stratified for early intervention rather than active surveillance [30].

### CONCLUSIONS

We successfully identified 26 DDR and HOXB13-related deleterious variants in 30 Korean men with aggressive mPC. Germline PV/LPV profiles show comparable frequency of overall carriers (8.8%) but distinctly different distribution when contrasted to previous studies in European and even geographically nearby Japanese cohorts, with BRCA2 playing a dominant role. These results illustrate further evidence for population-based, ethnic-specific analyses for genetic testing as well as highlighting the potential differences that exist even in common East Asian ancestry. These findings may further emphasize the importance of genomic background in Korean PC. Future combinatory efforts must be made in larger, multiethnic trials to identify PVs of variable importance depending on ancestry.
