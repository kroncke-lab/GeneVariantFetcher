The prevalence of somatic <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations and the ratio between somatic and germline <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations in unselected breast cancer patients are currently unclear.</p></div><div class=" sec"><div class="title">Patients and methods</div><p class="chapter-para">Paired normal and tumor DNA was analyzed for <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations by massively parallel sequencing in an unselected cohort of 273 breast cancer patients from south Sweden.</p></div><div class=" sec"><div class="title">Results</div><p class="chapter-para">Deleterious germline mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> (<em>n</em> = 10) or <em>BRCA2</em> (<em>n</em> = 10) were detected in 20 patients (7%). Deleterious somatic mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> (<em>n</em> = 4) or <em>BRCA2</em> (<em>n</em> = 5) were detected in 9 patients (3%). Accordingly, about 1 in 9 breast carcinomas (11%) in our cohort harbor a <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutation. For each gene, the tumor phenotypes were very similar regardless of the mutation being germline or somatically acquired, whereas the tumor phenotypes differed significantly between wild-type and mutated cases.

<p class="chapter-para">The tumor suppressor genes <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> have a critical role in the repair of DNA. Inactivation of either of these genes fundamentally influences cancer risk and development [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C1  MDW209C3"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C1  MDW209C3" data-open="MDW209C1  MDW209C3" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">1–3</a>]. Alleles can be inactivated by several mechanisms including germline mutation, somatic mutation, and epigenetic downregulation. The prevalence of somatic <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations in breast cancer is currently unclear, as studies have either been small in size or have focused only on a selected group of patients [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C4  MDW209C13"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C4  MDW209C13" data-open="MDW209C4  MDW209C13" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">4–13</a>]. Somatic mutation status is important to know since not only germline but also somatic mutations are believed to be treatment predictive for response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum agents [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C14"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C14" data-open="MDW209C14" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">14</a>]. For relapsed ovarian cancer, the PARP inhibitor olaparib has recently been approved in Europe for use in patients with <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations—regardless of the mutations being germline or somatic [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C15"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C15" data-open="MDW209C15" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">15</a>, <span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C16"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C16" data-open="MDW209C16" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">16</a>].

Additionally, cataloguing somatic <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> alterations could aid in the interpretation of germline variants of unknown significance [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C18"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C18" data-open="MDW209C18" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">18</a>].</p><p class="chapter-para">For the present study, we have analyzed an unselected cohort of 273 primary breast cancer patients treated in south Sweden at the Skåne University Hospital in Malmö.

<p class="chapter-para">Patients with preoperative diagnosis of invasive breast cancer scheduled for surgery in Malmö, Sweden, during the years 2007–2009, were asked to participate in the population-based All Breast Cancer in Malmö (ABiM) study.

<p class="chapter-para">In the present study, we report that 3% of the tumors from our cohort of unselected breast cancer patients harbored only somatic mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> and 7% harbored germline mutations. Accordingly, the likelihood of a mutation found in a breast carcinoma being somatic was 1/3 and germline 2/3, with ratio of 1 : 2. The tumor phenotypes were found to be similar regardless of the mutation being germline or somatically acquired, but germline mutations carriers were much younger at diagnosis (median age at diagnosis, germline <em>BRCA1</em> 41.5 years; germline <em>BRCA2</em> 49.5 years; somatic <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> 64 years; wild-type <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> 62.5 years), consistent with the Knudson two-hit hypothesis [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C25"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C25" data-open="MDW209C25" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">25</a>].</p><p class="chapter-para">Although our cohort is derived from a population-based series of breast cancer patients, we have previously shown that small- and low-grade tumors can be undersampled [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C19"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C19" data-open="MDW209C19" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">19</a>]. Therefore, and also influenced by DNA quantity requirements, patients with larger tumors and more aggressive features, such as high grade and high proliferation, were enriched in our study population. Accordingly, the prevalence of <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations, both germline and somatic, may be overestimations. However, given that there was no inclusion bias for age at diagnosis or family history, the ratio of somatic to germline mutations should be unbiased and representative. Our finding that 2/3 of the <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations found in the tumors were germline highlights the need for a strategy on how to deal with identified mutations when sequencing tumors without matched peripheral blood for comparison.</p><p class="chapter-para">A similar rate of 1/3 somatic versus 2/3 germline was found in the The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer study, which carried out exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples of a selected breast cancer patient cohort [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C26"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C26" data-open="MDW209C26" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">26</a>].

Their cohort consisted of patients referred to a tertiary cancer center who were likely to benefit from somatic genomic testing, and most patients had metastatic or inoperable disease. Although their study is informative for that kind of setting, it is possible that such ascertainment inflates the ratio of somatic to germline <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations.</p><p class="chapter-para"><em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations may soon prove treatment predictive for breast cancer.

Consequently, we can assess and interpret inclusion bias. Another strength is the comprehensive analytic method used, which is expected to detect a great majority of pathogenic mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>, including missense mutations and DNA copy number losses.</p><p class="chapter-para">There are also limitations to our study. First, a rather small number of carriers results in imprecise point estimates. Second, the ratio between somatic and germline <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutations depends on the study population, which must be considered for the generalizability of our results. Sweden is a country with a high incidence of breast cancer similar to that of the USA and most European nations: the lifetime risk for women is 12%. The median age at diagnosis (64 years) is higher than in many other countries. Although founder mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> have been reported, carriers of the five most common mutations account for only 19% of the total number of mutation carriers (Å. Borg, personal communication). Therefore, Sweden should be viewed as a country without strong founder mutations. Third, two of the mutations we found are not yet classified as definitely pathogenic (IARC class 5). For example, although <em>BRCA2</em> c.8524C&gt;T is not listed in BIC or ClinVar as definitely pathogenic, we consider it deleterious since it was classified pathogenic by Align-GVGD and found in one ovarian cancer sample according to COSMIC and independently in two of our tumor samples. In a homology-directed repair assay, it has intermediate function [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C28"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C28" data-open="MDW209C28" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">28</a>]. The stop-gain mutation <em>BRCA2</em> c.6901G&gt;T is located in exon 12. The fact that a low expressed transcript isoform carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion has been described [<span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C29"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C29" data-open="MDW209C29" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">29</a>, <span class="xrefLink" id="jumplink-MDW209C30"></span><a href="javascript:;" reveal-id="MDW209C30" data-open="MDW209C30" class="link link-ref link-reveal xref-bibr">30</a>] adds some uncertainty to the pathogenicity of this mutation. Functional and larger population-based studies are likely to be carried out over the next years, and they are needed to validate our results.</p><p class="chapter-para">In conclusion, in our data from a population without strong germline founder mutations, the likelihood of a <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>2</em> mutation found in a breast carcinoma being somatic was ∼1/3 and germline 2/3. This could have implications for treatment and genetic counseling.</p>                    <h2 scrollto-destination=112549595 id="112549595" class="section-title js-splitscreen-section-title" data-legacy-id=mdw209_s5>funding</h2>
