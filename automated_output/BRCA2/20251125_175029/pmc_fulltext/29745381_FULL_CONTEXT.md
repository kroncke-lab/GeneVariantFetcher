## Retraction Note to: The BRCA2 variant c.68–7 T > A is associated with breast cancer

### Retraction

This article [1] has been retracted at the request of the authors. Upon re-review of the data, the authors identified coding errors in this study. Due to an error in the SQL query, the conclusions drawn in the article are incorrect. A re-examination of the data shows that there is no association between familial breast cancer and the BRCA2 variant c.68–7 T > A. Another recent study suggests that the variant is not pathogenic [2]. All authors agree to this retraction.
