## BRCA1 and BRCA2 Germline Mutations Screening in Algerian Breast/Ovarian Cancer Families

### Abstract

Background: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in Algeria. The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Algerian population is largely unknown. Here, we describe analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 86 individuals from 70 families from an Algerian cohort with a personal and family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to breast cancer.
Methods: The approach used is based on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations screening by High-Resolution Melting (HRM) curve analysis followed by direct sequencing. All samples for which no pathogenic mutation was found were analyzed by MLPA for large deletions or duplications.
Results: Three distinct pathogenic mutations c.83_84delTG, c.181T>G, c.798_799delTT and two large rearrangements involving deletion of exon 2 and exon 8 respectively, were detected in BRCA1 gene. Moreover 17 unclassified variants and polymorphisms were detected in BRCA1 gene (6 described for the first time). Two pathogenic mutations, c.1310_1313delAAGA and c.5722_5723delCT and 40 unclassified variants and polymorphisms (14 never described before) were identified in BRCA2 gene.
Conclusions: For the first time, we used HRM and MLPA to identify BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Algerian patients with a personal and family history suggestive of genetic predisposition to breast cancer. The implications of these new findings in regard to genetic testing and counseling are substantial for the Algerian population.
