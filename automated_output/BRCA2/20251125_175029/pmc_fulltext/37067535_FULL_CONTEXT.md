## The pathogenic role of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition

### Abstract

AbstractSubstantial numbers of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) have been identified in BRCA1/2 through genetic testing, which poses a significant clinical challenge because the contribution of these VUSs to cancer predisposition has not yet been determined. Here, we report 10 Japanese patients from seven families with breast or ovarian cancer harboring the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant that was interpreted as a VUS. This variant recurs only in families from Japan and has not been reported in the global general population databases. A Japanese patient with Fanconi anemia with compound heterozygous variants c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) and c.475+1G>A in BRCA2 was reported. In silico predictions and quantitative cosegregation analysis suggest a high probability of pathogenicity. The clinical features of the variant carriers were not specific to, but were consistent with, those of patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A validated functional assay, called the mixed‐all‐nominated‐in‐one‐BRCA (MANO‐B) method and the accurate BRCA companion diagnostic (ABCD) test, demonstrated the deleterious effects of the variant. Altogether, following the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines, this variant satisfied the “PS3,” “PM2,” “PM3,” and “PP3” criteria. We thus conclude that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant is a “likely pathogenic” variant that is specifically observed in the Japanese population, leading to a breast and ovarian cancer predisposition.

### INTRODUCTION

The clinical application of high‐throughput sequencing technologies has recently identified an enormous number of sequence variants associated with the development of genetic disorders as well as variants whose clinical relevance remains to be determined, called “VUSs.” To the best of our knowledge, the term VUS was first used in a paper by Petrucelli et al. in 2002,
1
 describing genetic counseling practices for patients harboring variants with an unknown effect on protein function whose disease relevance was undefined in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Since then, the usage of the term VUS has spread widely, particularly in the field of HBOC. Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 genes has become increasingly relevant in the prevention and early detection strategies in healthy variant carriers, as well as in targeted treatment settings in patients with BRCA‐associated cancers using PARP inhibitors.
2
 Nonetheless, VUS still accounts for a significant fraction of variants in BRCA1/2 genetic testing,
3
 posing a challenge in the management of patients and their relatives. In this context, cosegregation analysis of the BRCA1/2 variants within families is one of the most powerful and robust methods to achieve a successful classification of the BRCA1/2 VUS.
4
 Moreover, the ACMG/AMP highlight functional studies as being among the most robust methods for establishing the pathogenicity of specific variants, using the codes “PS3”/“BS3” (well established functional assays demonstrate the [damaging/no damaging] effect on gene or gene product).
5

Here, we present a total of 10 Japanese patients from seven families with breast and ovarian cancers carrying a rare variant in the BRCA2 gene, c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe), classified as a VUS. The aim of this study was to reclassify this variant from VUS to a “pathogenic” or “likely pathogenic” variant. For this purpose, we thoroughly reviewed pertinent genetic and clinical information and performed a functional assay on this variant.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

We encountered two Japanese families (Families 1 and 2) in which several members carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant had a history of breast or ovarian cancer. Genetic testing for these families was conducted at Myriad Genetics Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT, USA) using BRACAnalysis, at FALCO Biosystems (Kyoto, Japan), or at Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Japan). This BRCA2 variant was interpreted according to the criteria of Myriad Genetics Laboratories. Subsequently, we further examined the database of the Japanese Organization of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (JOHBOC), which is the largest HBOC registration system in Japan, searching for data on this variant registered by August 2019. In the JOHBOC database, 62 hospitals in Japan registered 3517 probands and their relatives who underwent BRCA1/2 genetic testing, as reported previously.

 Almost all genetic testing was conducted at Myriad Genetics Laboratories using BRACAnalysis or at FALCO Biosystems, and the pathogenicity of the identified variants was classified based on the criteria of Myriad Genetics Laboratories. Following these investigations, we performed an extensive literature review of previous publications on this variant.

For public database analysis, we utilized population databases such as the gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), TopMed (https://bravo.sph.umich.edu/freeze8/hg38/), ToMMo 38KJPN (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/), and HGVD (http://www.hgvd.genome.med.kyoto‐u.ac.jp/). We also searched disease databases such as ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), HGMD (https://portal.biobase‐international.com/hgmd/pro/start.php), MGeND (https://mgend.med.kyoto‐u.ac.jp/), BRCA exchange (https://brcaexchange.org/), and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation databases (https://arup.utah.edu/database/BRCA/index.php). For in silico analyses, we utilized four prediction algorithms: CADD

This calculation was conducted for pedigrees that included at least two individuals with genotype information.

 In brief, a total of 244 BRCA2 variants was constructed by site‐directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the piggyBac vector containing a unique DNA barcode sequence. DLD1 BRCA2 (−/−) cells, derived from a BRCA2 knockout human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, were individually co‐transfected with the BRCA2 variant constructs and transposase expression vector. After the selection of stable transfectants using puromycin, equal amounts of DLD1 cells were mixed and cultured with PARP inhibitor (niraparib) or dimethyl sulfoxide. The barcode sequences were PCR amplified with genomic DNA extracted from the cell mixture and then subjected to deep sequence analysis to calculate their relative abundances. Based on the VarCall model,

### Patients carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant

We encountered two Japanese families (Families 1 and 2) in which several members carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant had a history of breast or ovarian cancer.

### RESULTS

The pedigree trees of the index families (Families 1 and 2) are shown in Figure 1A. In Family 1, the proband (III‐3) was a 59‐year‐old Japanese woman who was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, with negative immunostaining for estrogen and progesterone receptors and positive HER2. Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 identified a heterozygous missense variant NM_000059.3:c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) in BRCA2. This variant was initially classified as a VUS; thus, specific preventive and therapeutic management for HBOC was not utilized. Subsequently, her maternal cousin (III‐6), who also had a history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, which was positive for estrogen receptor and negative for progesterone receptor and HER2, at the age of 49 years, underwent BRCA1/2 genetic testing and was found to carry the same BRCA2 variant. Notably, the proband's mother (II‐2) and the cousin's mother (II‐4), who were sisters, had died of ovarian cancer (high‐grade serous carcinoma) at the ages of 65 and 72 years, respectively. Given that the proband and her cousin shared the same BRCA2 variant, their mothers were obligate variant carriers and were assumed to have this variant, despite the fact that genetic testing was not conducted. Another marked family history was that the proband's uncle (II‐3) had developed prostate cancer in his 70s. Additional genetic testing demonstrated that another female cousin (III‐7), who was a younger sister of III‐6 and had no history of cancer, did not harbor the variant.

Thus, their mothers (II‐2 and II‐4), both with a history of ovarian cancer, were obligate carriers of the variant. In Family 2, the proband (III‐1) and her mother (II‐14) harbored the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. (B) Three families (Families 3–5) from the JOHBOC database.

In Family 2, the proband (III‐1) was a 55‐year‐old Japanese woman who developed invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast at the age of 48 years, with negative immunostaining for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 (triple‐negative). Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 demonstrated that she had a missense variant c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) in BRCA2 in a heterozygous manner. Although this variant was interpreted as a VUS, an attending physician conducted a careful follow‐up. She has not developed any other cancers since then. Her mother (II‐14) had developed hepatic cirrhosis after a blood transfusion in her 30s. She later developed liver cancer in her 60s and then died at the age of 67 years. Genetic testing revealed that she also carried the same BRCA2 variant. Another notable family history was that the proband's maternal grandmother (I‐4) and maternal cousin (III‐9) developed breast cancer at the ages of 54 and 47 years, respectively, although genetic testing was not conducted for them.

According to the JOHBOC database, three Japanese patients with breast or ovarian cancer were registered as carriers of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The pedigree trees are shown in Figure 1B. In Family 3, a Japanese woman (III‐1) with a history of triple‐negative breast cancer at the age of 52 years harbored the BRCA1 c.188T>A (p.Leu63Ter) and BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variants. Her father (II‐1) developed pancreatic cancer at the age of 59 years, and her younger sister (III‐2) developed breast cancer at the age of 37 years, although genetic testing was not conducted for them. In Family 4, a Japanese woman (II‐1) who developed breast cancer positive for estrogen receptor and negative for progesterone receptor and HER2 at the age of 35 years had the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The patient's family history was unremarkable. In Family 5, a 53‐year‐old Japanese woman (II‐1) developed ovarian cancer (high‐grade serous carcinoma) and was found to carry the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The patient's family history was unremarkable.

We previously reported two Japanese patients with breast cancer carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant, where this variant was interpreted as a VUS.
22
 The pedigree trees are shown in Figure 1C. In Family 6, a Japanese woman (I‐2) harboring the variant developed breast cancer at the age of 63 years. Her daughter (II‐1) also developed bilateral breast cancer at the ages of 34 and 38 years, although genetic testing was not conducted. In Family 7, a Japanese woman (II‐1) with this variant developed breast cancer at 56 years of age. Her father (I‐1) had a history of prostate cancer at 72 years of age, while her mother (II‐2) developed breast cancer at the age of 85 years. Genetic testing for both parents was not conducted.

Moreover, we found that Mori et al.
23
 reported one Japanese male patient with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic multisystem disorder characterized by variable congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to malignancies. Biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in the BRCA2 gene are causative for Fanconi anemia. The patient had compound heterozygous variants c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) and c.475+1G>A in BRCA2. Given that the variant c.475+1G>A is known to be pathogenic, the finding that the variant c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) is in trans can be considered moderate evidence for pathogenicity.

In a comprehensive analysis of breast cancer in the Japanese population, Momozawa et al.
24
 reported that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant was found in 3 of 7051 Japanese females and none of 53 males with breast cancer. They also revealed that the variant was detected in none of 11,241 females and 2 of 12,490 males in the general Japanese population. The odds ratios were infinity (0.7–infinity) with a p‐value of 0.057 in females and 0.0 (0.0–572.9) with that of 1.000 in males. Therefore, the results between the two groups did not significantly differ in both sexes, indicating that the clinical significance of this variant was uncertain.

As shown in Table 1, the missense variant c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) in BRCA2 was not registered in population databases such as gnomAD, TopMed, and HGVD, whereas eight individuals were listed in ToMMo 38KJPN with an allele frequency of 1.03 × 10−4. In light of disease databases, this variant was interpreted as having “Uncertain significance” in ClinVar and MGeND. Notably, MGenD stated that four breast, two colorectal, and two prostate cancer patients had the variant; however, the details were not provided. According to HGMD, this variant was registered as a “Disease causing mutation?”. The clinical significance of this variant was “Not yet reviewed” in BRCA exchange. This variant was not listed in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation databases.

For in silico analyses, all prediction algorithms supported a deleterious effect, that is, this variant showed a CADD score of 27.0, and was predicted to be “Probably damaging” with a score of 1.0 by PolyPhen‐2, “Damaging” with a score of 0.0 by SIFT, and “Disease causing” by MutationTaster. Multiple alignment analysis involving 168 species revealed that serine 2616 (Ser2616) was conserved in 113 species and substituted with threonine in the remaining 55 species, but that substitution with phenylalanine was not observed in any species (Figure S1).

Among the families mentioned above, Families 1 and 2 were the only informative pedigrees in which genotype information was available for more than two individuals. According to the CoSeg R package, the cosegregation LRs of 7.535 and 1.321 were obtained from Families 1 and 2, respectively. A combined LR of 9.954 was obtained by multiplying these two scores. Thus, PPa was generated as 0.909 (= 9.954/(1 + 9.954)). Following the IARC guidelines, this PPa value was evaluated as Class 3 (uncertain).

Raw data of barcode sequence counts, including DLD cells harboring the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant, are shown in Table S1, and the processed data composed of normalized logarithmic fold change from all experiments are available as Data S1. The BF of this variant was estimated to be 6.09 × 102; thus, the variant was categorized as fClass 5 (pathogenic). The variant‐specific effect value, η, was calculated as −2.41 (95% CI: −2.70 to −2.14) as depicted in Figure 2 and Figure S2 coupled with the other 244 BRCA2 variants evaluated previously by the MANO‐B method.

Another notable family history was that the proband's maternal grandmother (I‐4) and maternal cousin (III‐9) developed breast cancer at the ages of 54 and 47 years, respectively, although genetic testing was not conducted for them.

### Registered families in the JOHBOC database

According to the JOHBOC database, three Japanese patients with breast or ovarian cancer were registered as carriers of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The pedigree trees are shown in Figure 1B. In Family 3, a Japanese woman (III‐1) with a history of triple‐negative breast cancer at the age of 52 years harbored the BRCA1 c.188T>A (p.Leu63Ter) and BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variants. Her father (II‐1) developed pancreatic cancer at the age of 59 years, and her younger sister (III‐2) developed breast cancer at the age of 37 years, although genetic testing was not conducted for them. In Family 4, a Japanese woman (II‐1) who developed breast cancer positive for estrogen receptor and negative for progesterone receptor and HER2 at the age of 35 years had the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The patient's family history was unremarkable. In Family 5, a 53‐year‐old Japanese woman (II‐1) developed ovarian cancer (high‐grade serous carcinoma) and was found to carry the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. The patient's family history was unremarkable.

### Literature review regarding the BRCA2 c.7847C>T variant

We previously reported two Japanese patients with breast cancer carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant, where this variant was interpreted as a VUS.
22
 The pedigree trees are shown in Figure 1C. In Family 6, a Japanese woman (I‐2) harboring the variant developed breast cancer at the age of 63 years. Her daughter (II‐1) also developed bilateral breast cancer at the ages of 34 and 38 years, although genetic testing was not conducted. In Family 7, a Japanese woman (II‐1) with this variant developed breast cancer at 56 years of age. Her father (I‐1) had a history of prostate cancer at 72 years of age, while her mother (II‐2) developed breast cancer at the age of 85 years. Genetic testing for both parents was not conducted.

Moreover, we found that Mori et al.
23
 reported one Japanese male patient with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic multisystem disorder characterized by variable congenital malformations, progressive bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to malignancies. Biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in the BRCA2 gene are causative for Fanconi anemia. The patient had compound heterozygous variants c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) and c.475+1G>A in BRCA2. Given that the variant c.475+1G>A is known to be pathogenic, the finding that the variant c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) is in trans can be considered moderate evidence for pathogenicity.

In a comprehensive analysis of breast cancer in the Japanese population, Momozawa et al.
24
 reported that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant was found in 3 of 7051 Japanese females and none of 53 males with breast cancer. They also revealed that the variant was detected in none of 11,241 females and 2 of 12,490 males in the general Japanese population. The odds ratios were infinity (0.7–infinity) with a p‐value of 0.057 in females and 0.0 (0.0–572.9) with that of 1.000 in males. Therefore, the results between the two groups did not significantly differ in both sexes, indicating that the clinical significance of this variant was uncertain.

### Variant database search and in silico analyses

As shown in Table 1, the missense variant c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) in BRCA2 was not registered in population databases such as gnomAD, TopMed, and HGVD, whereas eight individuals were listed in ToMMo 38KJPN with an allele frequency of 1.03 × 10−4. In light of disease databases, this variant was interpreted as having “Uncertain significance” in ClinVar and MGeND. Notably, MGenD stated that four breast, two colorectal, and two prostate cancer patients had the variant; however, the details were not provided. According to HGMD, this variant was registered as a “Disease causing mutation?”. The clinical significance of this variant was “Not yet reviewed” in BRCA exchange. This variant was not listed in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation databases.

For in silico analyses, all prediction algorithms supported a deleterious effect, that is, this variant showed a CADD score of 27.0, and was predicted to be “Probably damaging” with a score of 1.0 by PolyPhen‐2, “Damaging” with a score of 0.0 by SIFT, and “Disease causing” by MutationTaster. Multiple alignment analysis involving 168 species revealed that serine 2616 (Ser2616) was conserved in 113 species and substituted with threonine in the remaining 55 species, but that substitution with phenylalanine was not observed in any species (Figure S1).

### Quantitative cosegregation analysis

Among the families mentioned above, Families 1 and 2 were the only informative pedigrees in which genotype information was available for more than two individuals. According to the CoSeg R package, the cosegregation LRs of 7.535 and 1.321 were obtained from Families 1 and 2, respectively. A combined LR of 9.954 was obtained by multiplying these two scores. Thus, PPa was generated as 0.909 (= 9.954/(1 + 9.954)). Following the IARC guidelines, this PPa value was evaluated as Class 3 (uncertain).

### Functional analysis using the MANO‐B method and the ABCD test

Raw data of barcode sequence counts, including DLD cells harboring the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant, are shown in Table S1, and the processed data composed of normalized logarithmic fold change from all experiments are available as Data S1. The BF of this variant was estimated to be 6.09 × 102; thus, the variant was categorized as fClass 5 (pathogenic). The variant‐specific effect value, η, was calculated as −2.41 (95% CI: −2.70 to −2.14) as depicted in Figure 2 and Figure S2 coupled with the other 244 BRCA2 variants evaluated previously by the MANO‐B method.

### DISCUSSION

In recent years, the clinical interpretation of VUSs has become one of the most critical issues for high‐throughput sequencing approaches. Currently, efforts are ongoing in international consortia such as the ENIGMA to classify missense substitutions in BRCA1/2 according to their clinical relevance, using the multifactorial likelihood model.

 This model incorporates cosegregation profiles, tumor histopathology, co‐occurrence (in trans) with pathogenic variants, and evaluation of personal/family history of cancer. Given the rarity of each VUS in both the general population and cancer patients, insufficiency of family‐based genetic information for each VUS,
17
 and little predictive power of cancer histopathological features for BRCA2 variants,
26
 the cosegregation analysis of the variants with HBOC‐related cancers within families remains one of the most robust and powerful methods for VUS classification.
4
 In this study, however, we failed to demonstrate the pathogenicity of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant using the quantitative cosegregation analysis due to the limited number of genotyped individuals in each family. This is mainly because once a VUS is identified in a proband, genetic testing for other family members is not routinely conducted in genetic clinics.

Alternatively, in the framework of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, in vivo and in vitro functional assays can provide powerful insights into the effect of a variant on protein function and have a robust capacity to reclassify VUSs.
5
, 
27
 Thus, we utilized a newly developed and validated functional assay, the MANO‐B method, which enabled high‐throughput functional evaluation of BRCA2 variants using BRCA2‐deficient human cells and PARP inhibitors.
18
 The calculated sensitivity and specificity of this functional assay compared with those of the IARC classification system were reported to be 95% and 95% (95% CIs: 77–100 and 82–99), respectively.
18
 Moreover, we performed a simplified and on‐demand annotation assay, the ABCD test, and successfully demonstrated that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant had a deleterious effect and was classified as fClass 5 (pathogenic). Therefore, in light of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, this variant satisfied the “PS3” (well established in vivo and in vitro functional assays supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product), “PM2” (absent or extremely low frequency in the general population databases), “PM3” (for recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant), and “PP3” (multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product) criteria.
5
 Accordingly, the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant was classified as “likely pathogenic” according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines.

Several points regarding this study should be considered. First, the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant is a rare variant specifically observed in the Japanese population. As shown in Table 1, this variant was absent in global population databases such as gnomAD and TopMed. In addition, only eight Japanese individuals with this variant were registered in ToMMo 38KJPN, the largest variant database of the general Japanese population. Moreover, all variant carriers reported in the disease databases or literature were Japanese, as described above. These findings support the hypothesis that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant has a founder effect in the Japanese population. Unfortunately, haplotype analysis could not be conducted for the presented pedigrees because of the limited availability of genomic DNA samples.

Second, the clinical features of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant carriers should be discussed, as summarized in Table 2. Although the sample size is too small to draw a definitive conclusion, there seems to be no clinical difference between BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant carriers and patients with HBOC with BRCA2 pathogenic variants. In terms of age of cancer onset, the median age at the first onset of breast and ovarian cancers was 52 and 63 years, respectively, for all carriers of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant. These findings are consistent with those reported for BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers in the Japanese population (mean age ± SD = 45.2 ± 11.1 years for breast cancer and 58.3 ± 9.3 years for ovarian cancer), and for the BRCA‐negative Japanese population (48.8 ± 12.6 years for breast cancer and 53.8 ± 13.2 years for ovarian cancer).

, 
28
 From a histopathological perspective, three carriers with breast cancer (III‐3 and III‐6 in Family 1 and II‐1 in Family 3) were subgrouped as having luminal‐type breast cancer, whereas two patients (III‐1 in Family 2 and III‐1 in Family 3) developed triple‐negative breast cancer. Notably, patient III‐1 in Family 3 harbored c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) in BRCA2 as well as c.188T>A (p.Leu63Ter) in BRCA1, which is one of the BRCA1 founder variants in the Japanese population.
29
, 
30
 It is plausible that the BRCA1 c.188T>A (p.Leu63Ter) variant accounted for the onset of breast cancer in this individual and that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant had a subsidiary effect. Alternatively, according to the ENIGMA resource,
31
 triple‐negative tumor status is modestly predictive of BRCA2 pathogenic variant status in women over 50 years of age (LR = 1.79), suggesting that the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant may have contributed to the onset of triple‐negative breast cancer in these two individuals. Regarding ovarian cancer, three variant carriers had high‐grade serous adenocarcinoma. These findings are not specific to BRCA2 variant carriers, as luminal‐type tumors and high‐grade serous adenocarcinoma are the most common types of breast and ovarian cancer, respectively. As for the genetic location, this variant is located in the region inferred to be the BCCR2 in the BRCA2 gene. The ratio of the breast to ovarian cancers in carriers with this variant (7/3 = 2.33) was in line with what is expected for a pathogenic variant inside the BCCR2, estimated to be 2.31 (95% CI: 1.69–3.16).
32
 Altogether, these clinical characteristics observed in the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant are not specific to but are still compatible with those of the BRCA2‐associated HBOC spectrum.
31
 Of note, although “PP4” (Patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology) of the ACMG/AMP guideline did not seem applicable to the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant, it was still classified as “likely pathogenic” as discussed above.

Third, the characteristic features of the MANO‐B method as a functional assay of BRCA2 VUSs should be noted. To date, several hundred BRCA2 variants have been evaluated by a conventional HDR assay with a hamster cell line.
19
, 
33
, 
34
 There seems to be substantial room for improvement in the HDR assay because the throughput is quite low and it can assess the pathogenicity of variants only in the DNA‐binding domain.
3
 The MANO‐B method can overcome these limitations and provide scalable results using human cells stably expressing BRCA2 variants that enable us to evaluate all exonic variants of the BRCA2 gene. Notably, three variants (p.Arg2784Gln, p.Arg2842His, and p.Val2908Gly) exhibited some discrepancies between the functional interpretation in the MANO‐B method and the classification in the IARC/ClinVar, as depicted in Figure 2 and Figure S2. As discussed previously,
18
 this discrepancy is primarily attributable to the methodology underlying the IARC/ClinVar classification and the inconsistent results of the several functional assays. Moreover, from a clinical perspective, it should be added that the MANO‐B method and the ABCD test can be utilized as a companion diagnostic tool for PARP inhibitors in patients harboring BRCA2 VUSs. Once a dataset of 244 BRCA2 variants is obtained using the MANO‐B method, an additional independent assay generating only eight variants including a variant of interest can be integrated via batch effect compensation, as the ABCD test. The turnaround time of the ABCD test is estimated to be ~5 weeks, and there is no need to re‐analyze all variants each time. Thus, in a clinical setting, the MANO‐B method coupled with the ABCD test can serve as cancer‐risk‐management strategies including intensive cancer surveillance and preventive prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy among patients diagnosed as having BRCA2 VUS in a timely manner. Similarly, patients with metastatic breast/ovarian cancer harboring such VUS may benefit from therapy with platinum‐based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors targeting homologous recombination deficiency.
35

In conclusion, we report multiple cases of Japanese individuals carrying the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant that was initially categorized as a VUS. The clinical characteristics of the variant carriers were not specific to but were consistent with those of the BRCA2‐associated HBOC spectrum. This variant was observed only in the Japanese population, raising the possibility of a founder effect. The pathogenicity was successfully validated by a newly developed functional assay, the MANO‐B method and the ABCD test. These results, combined with in silico predictions as well as the presence in trans with a pathogenic variant in a patient of Fanconi anemia and absence from the general population databases, provide robust evidence for pathogenicity; thus, we propose re‐classification of the BRCA2 c.7847C>T (p.Ser2616Phe) variant to “likely pathogenic,” according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines. Further studies and case series are required to draw definitive conclusions regarding the pathogenicity of this variant.
