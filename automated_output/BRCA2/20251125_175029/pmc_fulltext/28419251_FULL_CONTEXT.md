## Evaluating genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk in high and moderate-penetrance genes in Asians

### Abstract

SummaryWe investigated up to 654 SNPs in 13 genes carrying high or moderate-penetrance mutations in association with breast cancer risk. Our study identified several new risk variants in the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and PALB2 genes in relation to breast cancer risk in Asian women.
