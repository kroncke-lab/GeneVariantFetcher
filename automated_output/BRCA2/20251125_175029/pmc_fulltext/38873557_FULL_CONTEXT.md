## Comparing Genomic Profiles of
ALK
Fusion-Positive and
ALK
Fusion-Negative Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Patients

### Abstract

Background
 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (
ALK
) fusion events account for 3 to 7% of genetic alterations in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to explore the landscape of
ALK
fusion-positive and
ALK
fusion-negative in a large cohort of NSCLC patients.
Methods
 The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of NSCLC patients who underwent next-generation sequencing from 2020 to 2023 in Yinfeng Gene Technology Co., Ltd. Clinical laboratory were included in this study.
Results
 In the current study, a total of 180 (3.20%) patients tested positive for
ALK
fusions in 5,622 NSCLC samples. Within the
ALK
-positive cohort, a total of 228
ALK
fusions were identified. Furthermore, five novel
ALK
fusion partners, including
DAB1-ALK
,
KCMF1-ALK
,
KIF13A-ALK
,
LOC643770-ALK
, and
XDH-ALK
were identified. In cases with
ALK
fusion-positive,
TP53
alterations were the most prevalent (26.3%), followed by
CDKN2A
(8.4%), epidermal growth factor receptor (
EGFR
, 5.6%), and
ALK
(5.6%). By contrast,
EGFR
alterations were most prevalent (51%) in patients with
ALK
fusion-negative NSCLC, followed by
TP53
(42.7%),
KRAS
(11.6%), and
CDKN2A
(11.3%). A total of 10 cases where
ALK
fusion co-occurred with
EGFR
mutations were also identified. Notably, the
ALK
fusion positivity rate was higher in younger patients (
p
 < 0.0001) and in female patients (
p
 = 0.0429). Additionally, positive
ALK
test results were more prevalent in patients with high programmed death-ligand 1 expression, especially when applying a 50% cutoff.
Conclusions
 Collectively, these findings offer valuable genomic insights that could inform the personalized clinical care of patients with NSCLC harboring
ALK
fusions within the context of precision medicine.

### Introduction

Lung cancer is the main contributor to cancer-related mortality across the globe, with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) encompassing >80% of all diagnosed cases.
1
2
Within the population of patients with NSCLC, an estimated 2 to 7% exhibit anaplastic lymphoma kinase (
ALK
) gene rearrangements, resulting in the abnormal expression and oncogenic activation of
ALK
.
3
4
The most prevalent and canonical
ALK
gene arrangement in NSCLC is the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (
EML4
)-
ALK
fusion, wherein various
EML4
breakpoints fuse in-frame with the kinase domain of
ALK
.
5
Notably, >15 distinct
EML4-ALK
fusion variants have been identified in NSCLC, with v1, v2, and v3a/b being the most frequently encountered variants.
6
In addition to these, certain
ALK
fusions, although less prevalent in NSCLC, have been reported, classified as noncanonical
ALK
fusions. These include kinesin family member 5B (
KIF5B
)-
ALK
,
TRK
-fused gene (
TFG
)-
ALK
, kinesin light chain 1 (
KLC1
)-
ALK
, striatin (
STRN
)-
ALK
, and
TNFAIP3
interacting protein 2 (
TNIP2
)-
ALK
.

It is noteworthy that some
ALK
fusions are predominantly found in other types of cancers.

In recent years, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to explore treatments targeting specific molecular mechanisms, such as
ALK
fusion. Small molecule inhibitors designed for
ALK
fusion, including crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for various cancer types.

13
Despite these advancements, it is noteworthy that a subset of patients with
ALK
-positive NSCLC (10–40%) fail to respond to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This emphasizes the clinical importance of further stratifying patients with
ALK
-positive NSCLC based on their response to TKIs. While there is potential benefit in identifying
ALK
fusions, it remains uncertain whether tumors with
ALK
fusions constitute a distinct, albeit rare, subtype that should be detected early for targeted therapy. With the continued development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, obtaining the genomic landscape of patients with cancer has become more affordable and accessible. In the current study, the aim was to unveil the genomic landscape of
ALK
fusion-positive tumors in 180 NSCLC patients who underwent sequencing. The aim was to elucidate their genomic mutation patterns and characteristics, which could notably contribute to the development of more precise and effective treatment strategies.

### Materials and Methods

The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of NSCLC patients who underwent NGS from 2020 to 2023 in Yinfeng Gene Technology Co., Ltd. were included. The diagnosis of the specimens was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining by an independent pathologist. The specimens were required to have a percentage of tumor cells over 20% and a size ≥1 mm for further analysis.

The DNA extraction process involved a microdissection technique for precise dissection of tissue blocks. Genomic DNA was then extracted from FFPE samples using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kits (Qiagen GmbH, 56404). The quality of the isolated genomic DNA was assessed through the measurement of DNA concentration, using Qubit DNA Assay Kits and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), as well as through 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to evaluate DNA degradation. To create DNA fragments in the range of 180 to 280 bp hydrodynamic shearing was executed on 0.6 g of genomic DNA using the M220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris, LLC). Subsequently, sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc. 5190-8863). For the purpose of target enrichment, the constructed libraries were hybridized with custom-designed biotinylated oligonucleotide probes (Roche Diagnostics). Following this, the index-coded library samples were clustered using the Illumina cBot Cluster Generation System (Illumina, Inc.) and the DNA libraries were sequenced with the use of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system (Illumina, Inc.).

In the current study, the association of
ALK
fusions with age and sex was examined through the Fisher's exact test and the Mann–Whitney U test. Furthermore, the relationship between genomic characteristics and the proportion of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was assessed using the Fisher's exact test with the cutoff values set at 1 and 50%. It is noteworthy that all statistical tests were conducted as two-sided tests.
p
 < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

### Clinical Specimens

The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of NSCLC patients who underwent NGS from 2020 to 2023 in Yinfeng Gene Technology Co., Ltd. were included. The diagnosis of the specimens was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin staining by an independent pathologist. The specimens were required to have a percentage of tumor cells over 20% and a size ≥1 mm for further analysis.

### DNA Extraction and Next-Generation Sequencing

The DNA extraction process involved a microdissection technique for precise dissection of tissue blocks. Genomic DNA was then extracted from FFPE samples using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kits (Qiagen GmbH, 56404).

### Statistical Analysis

In the current study, the association of
ALK
fusions with age and sex was examined through the Fisher's exact test and the Mann–Whitney U test. Furthermore, the relationship between genomic characteristics and the proportion of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was assessed using the Fisher's exact test with the cutoff values set at 1 and 50%.

### Results

A total of 5,622 patients diagnosed with NSCLC who had undergone tissue-based NGS with 500 cancer gene panel were included in the current analysis. Among them, 180 (3.2%) patients were identified as having
ALK
fusions. The median age of the patients was 58 years, with an age range 26 to 82; 48% of the patients were men. The majority of patients had lung adenocarcinoma (177 cases; 98.3%), whereas a small number had lung squamous cell carcinoma (two cases; 1.1%) and lung adenosquamous carcinoma (one case; 0.6%). Among the 180 patients with
ALK
fusions, 65 (36.1%) patients had evaluable microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and no patients with high MSI were detected. Furthermore, 54 (30%) patients had evaluable tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with only two (1.1%) patients presenting with high TMB (
Table 1
). The cutoff for MSI was 29 (13.5%) based on the evaluation of 55 microsatellite markers, and the cutoff for TMB was nine mutations per megabase for the panels. Notably, NGS was conducted on 180 pairs of tumor and white blood cell samples, and all samples that passed the histology quality control yielded sufficient DNA quantities for NGS analysis.

Abbreviations: H, high; L, low; MSI, microsatellite instability; MSS, microsatellite stable; N/A, not applicable; TMB, tumor mutational burden.

Using NGS, a total of 180 patients who harbored
ALK
fusions were identified and categorized into the
ALK
fusion-positive group, whereas those without
ALK
fusions constituted the
ALK
fusion-negative group. Among the ALK cohort, although a total of 228 ALK fusions were identified, 43 (25%) patients exhibited simultaneous occurrences of ≥2 distinct ALK fusions (
Table 2
). The predominant fusion partner within the present cohort was
EML4
, accounting for 70% (160/228) of cases followed by
KLC1
(2.2%; 5/228),
KIF5B
(2.2%; 5/228), and
HIP1
(0.9%; 2/228). In the
ALK
fusion-positive patients, various
EML4-ALK
variants were identified, including variant 1 (E13; A20; 35.0%; 56/160), variant 2 (E20; A20; 9.4%; 15/160), variant 3 (E6; A20; 41.8%; 67/160), variant 5 (E2; A20; 4.4%; 7/160), and other variants (9.4%; 15/160;

In addition to
EML4-ALK
fusions, the cohort of the current study also revealed the presence of other
ALK
fusion partners. It is noteworthy that novel variants, including intergenic fusions, have been extensively analyzed due to their potential marked clinical implications for fusion carriers.
14
Consequently, these novel variants, particularly intergenic fusions, have garnered considerable attention as they may represent potential targetable variants. In the present study, a total of five
ALK
intergenic fusions were identified (
Table 3
). Typically, fusions involving intergenic regions were considered unlikely to produce functional fusion transcripts. However, emerging evidence suggests that intergenic fusions may also lead to the generation of functional fusion proteins after transcription, potentially involving mechanisms such as chromothripsis and alternative splicing.
14
For five cases where RNA-based NGS assays were unsuccessful due to limited materials, further investigation is warranted. Furthermore, among these cases, it is noteworthy that two patients,
CLIP4
(intergenic)-
ALK
(intergenic, exon14) and
MTA3
(intergenic)-
ALK
(intergenic, exon20), also carried the canonical
EML4-ALK
fusion (exon6; exon20;
Table 3
).

Additionally, five novel
ALK
fusion partners were identified (
Table 3
). These novel fusions included
KCMF1-ALK
(
Fig. 2A
),
XDH-ALK
(
Fig. 2B
),
KIF13A-ALK
(
Fig. 2C
),
LOC643770-ALK
(
Fig. 2D
), and
DAB1-ALK
(
Fig. 3A
). Notably, one patient with an
XDH-ALK
fusion (exon23; exon19) was found to concurrently possess the canonical
EML4-ALK
fusion (exon13; exon20;
Table 3
). However, a previous study
15
reported that patients with NSCLC and complex
ALK
fusions could potentially have better treatment outcomes to
ALK
TKI therapy. Furthermore, a novel
DAB1-ALK
fusion variant was identified in a patient with pulmonary adenosquamous carcinoma (
Fig. 3A
). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report a
DAB1-ALK
fusion in patients with NSCLC. To confirm the presence of the
ALK
fusion, pathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on puncture tissue samples. The results validated the existence of the
ALK
fusion in adenosquamous carcinoma samples (
Fig. 3B, C
).

In the present analysis of 180
ALK
fusion-positive cases,
TP53
alterations were the most prevalent (26.3%), followed by
CDKN2A
(8.4%), epidermal growth factor receptor (
EGFR
, 5.6%), and
ALK
(5.6%). Other noteworthy genomic alterations include
MET
(4.5%),
PTEN
(2.8%),
ERBB2
(2.8%),
KRAS
(2.2%), and
BRAF
(2.2%). Among the ALK fusion-positive cases, a total of 55 variations were identified in
TP53
, encompassing 30 missense mutations, 10 nonsense mutations, five splice mutations, five frameshift mutations, four copy number loss mutations, and one deletion mutation. Additionally, patients with ALK fusion-positive NSCLC exhibited 15 variations in
CDKN2A
, including 14 copy number loss mutations and one missense mutation. Moreover,
MET
displayed eight variations in the eight cases, consisting of two missense mutations (p.Q812E, p.A1363T), five copy number gain mutations and one intron mutation. In the five cases with variations in
ERBB2
, there were five variations, including four missense mutations (p.N125S, p.G603S, p.S310F, p.D1144H) and one frameshift mutation (p.N125S). Furthermore,
BRAF
manifested four variations, including three missense mutations (p.I582V, p.E695Q, p.V600E) and one copy number gain mutation. The concurrent presence of
ALK
-positive NSCLC and
EGFR
mutations is an infrequently observed clinical phenomenon, suggesting the potential for concurrent targeting of
ALK
and
EGFR
as an effective therapeutic approach for these patients. The current study revealed 10 cases where
ALK
fusion co-occurred with
EGFR
mutations, with three cases involving
EML4-ALK
fusion and
EGFR
p.L858R co-mutations, and one case featuring
EML4-ALK
fusion and
EGFR
p.E746_A750del co-mutation (

Comparatively, when patients with
ALK
fusion-negative NSCLC were examined,
EGFR
alterations were shown to be the most prevalent (51%), followed by
TP53
(42.7%),
KRAS
(11.6%), and
CDKN2A
(11.3%). Other genomic alterations included
PIK3CA
(10.1%),
ERBB2
(7.5%),
MET
(6.7%),
NF1
(5.5%), and
PTEN
(4.3%;
Fig. 4B
).

In the present cohort of patients with
ALK
fusion-positive tumor, five patients were identified as carrying germline mutations in five different cancer predisposition genes. These mutations included two pathogenic alterations in
RAD50
(c.1969 + 1G > A) and
BRCA1
(c.3841C > T), two likely pathogenic alterations in
BRCA2
(c.2180C > G) and
FANCL
(c.96 + 2T > A), and one mutation of uncertain significance in
SLX4
(c.2854_2855delGCinsAT). Additional clinical details and the distribution of these germline mutations in the patient cohort are provided in
Table 4
.

Among the 180 patients with
ALK
fusion, there were 93 and 87 female and male patients, respectively, with a median age of 58 years (range, 26–82 years). Notably, patients with NSCLC carrying
ALK
fusion-positive tumors were significantly younger than those with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 < 0.0001;
Fig. 5A
). This observation aligns with a previous study.
16
Regarding sex differences, a higher relative proportion of women was observed among patients with
ALK
fusion-positive tumors compared with those with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 = 0.0429;
Fig. 5B
). However, a previous study
17
reported that there were no significant differences in
ALK
fusion between men and women.

(C) The TPS (cutoff = 1%) percentage of patients between ALK+ and ALK− groups. (D) The TPS (cutoff = 50%) percentage of patients between ALK+ and ALK− groups.

The upregulation of the
ALK
fusion protein has been shown to elevate PD-L1 expression, and immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated efficacy in both crizotinib-sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells.
18
Therefore, an assessment of PD-L1 expression within the present cohort was conducted, which consisted of a total of 2,210 eligible patients after the exclusion of those lacking PD-L1 expression data. PD-L1 IHC was performed using the Dako22C3 antibody. In the current comprehensive study, a statistically significant increase was observed in the prevalence of
ALK
-positive test results among patients exhibiting high PD-L1 expression levels, as determined by a 1% cutoff (
p
 = 0.0116;
Fig. 5C
). Furthermore, when applying a 50% cutoff,
ALK
fusion-positive tumors exhibited significantly elevated PD-L1 expression compared with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 < 0.0001;
Fig. 5D
). These findings suggest a potential association between increased PD-L1 expression in
ALK
fusion-positive tumors and poorer progression-free survival (PFS) following TKI therapy.

Copy number variations (CNVs) were identified in 61% (111/180) of the samples in the present study cohort. Notably, approximately 11% of the patients in the cohort exhibited CNVs in
CDKN2A
, a potential candidate contributing to tumorigenesis and disease progression.
18
Furthermore, previous studies have shown association of CNVs in
CDKN2A
,
CDKN2B
,
MCL1
,

, and

with prognosis.

CNVs in

were also detected in fusion-positive samples from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database. Within the present study cohort, it was observed that CNVs in
CDKN2A
and
CDKN2B
exhibited a notably high frequency (
Fig. 6
).

### Characteristics of Patients with
ALK
Fusions

A total of 5,622 patients diagnosed with NSCLC who had undergone tissue-based NGS with 500 cancer gene panel were included in the current analysis. Among them, 180 (3.2%) patients were identified as having
ALK
fusions. The median age of the patients was 58 years, with an age range 26 to 82; 48% of the patients were men.

Table 1
). The cutoff for MSI was 29 (13.5%) based on the evaluation of 55 microsatellite markers, and the cutoff for TMB was nine mutations per megabase for the panels. Notably, NGS was conducted on 180 pairs of tumor and white blood cell samples, and all samples that passed the histology quality control yielded sufficient DNA quantities for NGS analysis.

### Molecular Features of
ALK
Fusion-Positive Patients

Using NGS, a total of 180 patients who harbored
ALK
fusions were identified and categorized into the
ALK
fusion-positive group, whereas those without
ALK
fusions constituted the
ALK
fusion-negative group. Among the ALK cohort, although a total of 228 ALK fusions were identified, 43 (25%) patients exhibited simultaneous occurrences of ≥2 distinct ALK fusions (

, there were five variations, including four missense mutations (p.N125S, p.G603S, p.S310F, p.D1144H) and one frameshift mutation (p.N125S). Furthermore,
BRAF
manifested four variations, including three missense mutations (p.I582V, p.E695Q, p.V600E) and one copy number gain mutation. The concurrent presence of
ALK
-positive NSCLC and
EGFR
mutations is an infrequently observed clinical phenomenon, suggesting the potential for concurrent targeting of
ALK
and
EGFR
as an effective therapeutic approach for these patients. The current study revealed 10 cases where
ALK
fusion co-occurred with
EGFR
mutations, with three cases involving
EML4-ALK
fusion and
EGFR
p.L858R co-mutations, and one case featuring
EML4-ALK
fusion and
EGFR
p.E746_A750del co-mutation (

).

Comparatively, when patients with
ALK
fusion-negative NSCLC were examined,
EGFR
alterations were shown to be the most prevalent (51%), followed by
TP53
(42.7%),
KRAS
(11.6%), and
CDKN2A
(11.3%). Other genomic alterations included
PIK3CA
(10.1%),
ERBB2
(7.5%),
MET
(6.7%),
NF1
(5.5%), and
PTEN
(4.3%;

).

In the present cohort of patients with
ALK
fusion-positive tumor, five patients were identified as carrying germline mutations in five different cancer predisposition genes. These mutations included two pathogenic alterations in
RAD50
(c.1969 + 1G > A) and
BRCA1
(c.3841C > T), two likely pathogenic alterations in
BRCA2
(c.2180C > G) and
FANCL
(c.96 + 2T > A), and one mutation of uncertain significance in
SLX4
(c.2854_2855delGCinsAT). Additional clinical details and the distribution of these germline mutations in the patient cohort are provided in
Table 4

### Age, Sex, and PD-L1 Expression in
ALK
Fusion-Positive Tumors

Among the 180 patients with
ALK
fusion, there were 93 and 87 female and male patients, respectively, with a median age of 58 years (range, 26–82 years). Notably, patients with NSCLC carrying
ALK
fusion-positive tumors were significantly younger than those with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 < 0.0001;
Fig. 5A
). This observation aligns with a previous study.
16
Regarding sex differences, a higher relative proportion of women was observed among patients with
ALK
fusion-positive tumors compared with those with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 = 0.0429;
Fig. 5B
). However, a previous study
17
reported that there were no significant differences in
ALK
fusion between men and women.

(C) The TPS (cutoff = 1%) percentage of patients between ALK+ and ALK− groups. (D) The TPS (cutoff = 50%) percentage of patients between ALK+ and ALK− groups.

The upregulation of the
ALK
fusion protein has been shown to elevate PD-L1 expression, and immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated efficacy in both crizotinib-sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells.
18
Therefore, an assessment of PD-L1 expression within the present cohort was conducted, which consisted of a total of 2,210 eligible patients after the exclusion of those lacking PD-L1 expression data. PD-L1 IHC was performed using the Dako22C3 antibody. In the current comprehensive study, a statistically significant increase was observed in the prevalence of
ALK
-positive test results among patients exhibiting high PD-L1 expression levels, as determined by a 1% cutoff (
p
 = 0.0116;
Fig. 5C
). Furthermore, when applying a 50% cutoff,
ALK
fusion-positive tumors exhibited significantly elevated PD-L1 expression compared with
ALK
fusion-negative tumors (
p
 < 0.0001;
Fig. 5D
). These findings suggest a potential association between increased PD-L1 expression in
ALK
fusion-positive tumors and poorer progression-free survival (PFS) following TKI therapy.

### Copy Number Variations in Patients with
ALK F
usions

Copy number variations (CNVs) were identified in 61% (111/180) of the samples in the present study cohort. Notably, approximately 11% of the patients in the cohort exhibited CNVs in
CDKN2A
, a potential candidate contributing to tumorigenesis and disease progression.
18
Furthermore, previous studies have shown association of CNVs in
CDKN2A
,
CDKN2B
,
MCL1
,
MDM2
, and
IRS2
with prognosis.

CNVs in

,
MYC
,
MDM2
, and
CCND1
were also detected in fusion-positive samples from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database. Within the present study cohort, it was observed that CNVs in
CDKN2A
and
CDKN2B
exhibited a notably high frequency (

### Discussion

In the era of precision medicine, the genomic profiles of patients can play a pivotal role in tailoring treatment strategies. For patients with
ALK
fusion-positive NSCLC, a detailed genomic profile can elucidate the fusion partner and rearranged breakpoint. In the present study, NGS technologies were used to identify
ALK
rearrangement events in 180 Chinese patients with NSCLC. Consistent with previous studies,
EML4
is the most common
ALK
fusion partner, with the fusion occurring in the three predominant variants.
6
Notably, the present study reports the discovery of five novel
ALK
fusion partners:
DAB1
,
KCMF1
,
KIF13A
,
LOC643770
, and
XDH
. This suggests that NGS-based assessment for
ALK
fusions is accurate and comprehensive, offering unique advantages in detecting previously unknown
ALK
fusion partners and precisely identifying breakpoints compared with traditional methods like fluorescence in situ hybridization and IHC.

EGFR
mutations and
ALK
fusions are the two pivotal driver mutations in NSCLC. Traditionally,
EGFR
mutations and
EML4-ALK
translocations were considered to be mutually exclusive.
23
24
Nonetheless, a growing body of evidence suggests that concurrent mutations, although infrequent, can occur.
25
26
This phenomenon can be attributed to two situations. First, tumor heterogeneity, where distinct tumor cell clones individually carry either an
EGFR
mutation or an
ALK
fusion.
27
Second, the same tumor cell clone harbors both an
EGFR
mutation and an
ALK
rearrangement.
28
29
In the current study, 10 patients with
EGFR/ALK
co-mutations were identified. Among them, three cases involved
EML4-ALK
fusion and
EGFR
p.L858R co-mutations, whereas one case featured
EML4-ALK
fusion and an
EGFR
p.E746_A750del co-mutation. However, there is limited information available regarding the effects of pharmaceutical treatment on these concurrent mutations. A recent study suggested that
EML4-ALK
rearrangements could serve as a rare, acquired resistance mechanism following EGFR-TKI treatment.
30
Nevertheless, there are also studies indicating a more common acquisition of
EGFR
mutations following ALK-TKI therapy.
30

Moreover, Christopoulos et al
31
reported that concurrent
TP53
mutations serve as a robust prognostic indicator in patients with
ALK
fusion-positive NSCLC.
31
The authors further indicated that the
EML4-ALK
fusion variant V3 was linked to a more aggressive phenotype and inferior overall survival (OS) due to the early failure of various therapeutic approaches. Additionally, they observed that patients positive for both V3 and
TP53
alterations faced a notably high risk of death, with an OS of approximately 2 years. In the present dataset of 180
ALK
fusion-positive samples,
TP53
alterations were the most prevalent co-mutations, occurring in 26.3% of cases. Consequently, these patients may be independently associated with increased metastatic potential, shorter responses to TKI treatment, and poorer OS in
ALK
lung adenocarcinoma. Both of these markers hold the potential to aid in selecting cases for more aggressive management and guiding the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

The data of the present study revealed significantly higher PD-L1 expression in tumors with
ALK
fusions, particularly when using a 5% cutoff compared with fusion-negative tumors. Several studies have demonstrated an association between high tumor PD-L1 expression and poorer PFS in response to ALK-TKIs.
32
33
34
35
36
A prior study indicated that PD-L1 expression status alone did not markedly impact the OS of patients with
ALK
-positive NSCLC.
37
Nevertheless, a previous study found that high baseline PD-L1 expression was associated with shorter OS in
ALK
-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma.
36
In another recent study, patients with high PD-L1 expression were found to exhibit an immunosuppressive status in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The characteristics of the TME may aid in identifying patients who would derive greater benefits from ALK-TKIs.
38

However, the current study also has several limitations. First, complete and detailed patient clinicopathological characteristics, as well as treatment details, including the survival status of all patients with
ALK
fusion-positive NSCLC were not collected. Second, the functional properties of these novel
ALK
fusion proteins and their potential impact on TKI therapy remain unexplored, and further investigation is required. By conducting an analysis of the protein structure and functional sequences of
ALK
, significant
ALK
fusion variants can potentially be identified.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, the present study represents a comprehensive analysis of
ALK
fusions in a substantial cohort of Chinese patients with NSCLC. The current study outcome contributes valuable genomic information for personalized clinical management in the era of precision medicine for patients with
ALK
fusions.
