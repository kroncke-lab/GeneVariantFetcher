## Generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell lines from breast cancer patients carrying BRCA2 variants

### Abstract

Germline pathogenic variants in the BRCA2 gene are strongly correlated with an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. Two specific BRCA2 variants, c.8167G>C (p.Asp2723His) and c.1583del (p.Asn528fs), have been identified from individuals with a family history of breast cancer. Here we generated two iPSC lines from breast cancer patients who are heterozygous carriers of these two variants. These iPSCs exhibit pluripotency and demonstrate the capability to differentiate into three germ layers. These iPSC lines represent a valuable resource for personalized pre-clinical research, offering new opportunities to explore the underlying mechanisms of breast cancer and develop targeted therapeutic approaches.
