## High-resolution melting analysis coupled with next-generation sequencing as a simple tool for the identification of a novel somatic BRCA2 variant: a case report

### Abstract

In a 72-year-old woman with no associated personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancers, we identified a novel somatic pathogenic BRCA2 variant (c.18_28delAGAGAGGCCAA, p.Lys6Asnfs*4) using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The variant allele frequency (VAF) was 16%, and Sanger sequencing was unable to identify this variant. Adopting a high-resolution melting analysis strategy coupled with NGS, we successfully highlighted the presence of the c.18_28delAGAGAGGCCAA allele.
