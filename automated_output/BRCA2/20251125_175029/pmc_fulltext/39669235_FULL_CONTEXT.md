## Carrier screening program for BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants among Ashkenazi Jewish women in Israel: An observational study

### Abstract

PurposeThe aim of the study was to evaluate the results of a large-scale BRCA1/2 carrier screening program among Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) women.MethodsWe performed a cross-sectional study of women who were eligible for BRCA1/2 screening program. Women who self-reported as complete or partial AJ were screened for 14 pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 genes, following the Israeli Ministry of Health’s national screening program.ResultsThe study included 13,502 women who underwent screening between June 2020 and June 2022. The prevalence of the pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 was 0.89% (120 of 13,502) among the tested women. Of the 14 variants tested, only 6 variants were detected. Three variants, known as the founder variants among AJ, accounted for 96.6% of identified variants (NM_000059.4(BRCA2):c.5946del, p.(Ser1982fs); NM_007294.4(BRCA1):c.68_69del, p.(Glu23fs); NM_007294.4(BRCA1):c.5266dup, p.(Gln1756fs)). The tested women were younger and of a higher socioeconomic status compared with the eligible non-tested women.ConclusionThe study provides a new insight into a large carrier screening program for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in AJ women in Israel. These findings present real-world prevalence of women who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in AJ population and the importance of such programs.

### Introduction

Pathogenic variants in the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1, MIM 113705) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2, MIM 600185) are the most common cause of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) predisposition in women of all ethnicities. Variants in these genes are associated with increased risk for various cancer types among males and females.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Although most cases of breast and ovarian cancers in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population are sporadic, approximately 11% and 40% are predisposed by pathogenic variants in the BRCA1/2 genes, respectively.2, 3, 4,6

More than 7000 pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 have been associated with increased risk for HBOCs.7,8 Among AJ, only 3 founder variants in the BRCA1/2 genes account for most HBOC cases: (1) NM_000059.4(BRCA2):c.5946del, p.(Ser1982fs); (2) NM_007294.4(BRCA1):c.68_69del, p.(Glu23fs); and (3) NM_007294.4(BRCA1):c.5266dup, p.(Gln1756fs). Approximately 1 in 40 (2.5%) AJ individuals were found to carry one of these variants previously.9 The frequency of these variants among AJ was previously reported to range between 0.96% and 1.14% for BRCA1 c.68_6del, 0.13% and 0.28% for BRCA1 c.5266dup, and 1.52% for BRCA2 c.5946del.9, 10, 11, 12

This phenomenon of few variants associated with the majority of BRCA1/2- related HBOC cases is unique. In the past decades, there has been an increased rate of mixed ancestry marriages; thus, many individuals are only partially AJ, and the real frequency of women who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in the Israeli population is unknown.

To decrease breast and ovarian cancer–related morbidity and mortality among heterozygotes, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network issued recommendations for an intensive follow-up program for individuals who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and for testing family members for carrier status.9,13 These follow-up programs have been shown to significantly reduce cancer-related morbidity and mortality.13

Despite the increased risk of cancer and the high penetrance in women, approximately half of women who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants lack suggestive family history, mostly because of the sex of family members, small pedigrees, incomplete penetrance, cancer-risk modifying variants (often incorporated into polygenic risk score [PRS]), and other nongenetic risk modifiers such as lifestyle.2,13,14 Therefore, a testing strategy based only on a family history may fail to detect about 50% of at-risk individuals positive for the BRCA1/2 variants.2,13,14

In 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated a funded BRCA1/2 carrier screening program for AJ women, without requiring pretesting genetic counseling. Since 2020, women meeting the following criteria were encouraged to complete the screening test: (1) full or partial AJ origin based on self-report, (2) age ≥ 18 years, and (3) self-report of no personal history of breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer.

In this study, with the aim to evaluate the results of the BRCA1/2 carrier screening program, we characterized individuals who underwent BRCA1/2 screening test at Clalit Health Services (CHS) and estimated the frequency of women who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants of those who were screened. The results of this study are important for improving the BRCA1/2 screening program, defining the target population, and tailoring specific interventions for better health outcomes.

### Materials and Methods

The data were extracted from CHS, the largest health care provider in Israel, insuring more than half of the Israeli population.

CHS has a comprehensive data warehouse that combines administrative and clinical data from community and hospital records, including demographic information, laboratory results, diagnoses given in a community or hospital setting, clinical and behavioral markers, and medical procedures. The raw data extracted were coded, viewed, and stored only within the Clalit Research Institute.

We performed a cross-sectional study. The study population includes individuals who were CHS members and met the following eligibility criteria: (1) women, (2) age ≥ 25 years, (3) fully or partially of AJ origin (at least 1 grandparent of AJ by self-report), (4) have no personal history of BRCA1/2-associated cancer (breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer),10,13 and (5) women with no known familial pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene, by self-report.

Information regarding the implications of the test and the risk of being positive for BRCA1/2 variants were provided by physicians, nurses, or geneticists from various clinics and hospitals. Women who showed interest were required to schedule an appointment to the test.

Two days before the test, participants were provided with a link to an explanatory webpage on the CHS website and an explanatory video through a text message.

The test was performed without requiring pretesting genetic counseling. Upon arrival for the test, participants were provided with an oral explanation by a genetic nurse who had received prior training. Written informed consent, containing information regarding the implications and potential outcomes of the test, was also obtained.

Women with a known first-degree family history of relevant cancer were recommended to undergo genetic counseling alongside the test.

Women who did not meet the eligibility test criteria did not perform the test and were referred for genetic counseling.

The test was performed at 6 CHS hospitals, and the date of performing the genetic test was defined as the index date. For CHS members who were not tested, the index date was defined as the end of research (July 1, 2022). Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA was extracted with the PureGene kit (Gentra, Inc) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Specimens were analyzed for 14 common pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 in the Israeli population including the known AJ founder variants with NanoCHIP (Gamidor Diagnostics) (Supplemental Table 1).

Women positive for BRCA1/2 variants were promptly invited to genetic counseling to receive the test results and follow-up recommendations.

Women whose carrier status was negative were informed of their test results, through a letter, email, or online (based on their preference), along with a written/electronic communication of the implications and recommendations to continue with general follow-up, according to the recommendations of the attending physician. Moreover, they were advised to seek genetic counseling if they had a personal or family history of cancer.

Self-reported ethnicity was validated based on CHS electronic medical records (EMRs) of maternal and paternal grandparents’ country of birth.15 For each individual, EMR-based ethnicity was derived in a stepwise manner: (1) based on the birth country of each grandparent; (2) if information regarding the grandparent was unavailable, the birth country of the parent was used; and (3) finally, if both were unavailable, the birth country of the patient was used. Each birth country is assigned one of these ethnicities—AJ, Sephardic, Ethiopian Jewish, and Arab.

For this study, the EMR-based ethnicity was divided into 6 groups: having 1 grandparent AJ (at least 25% AJ), having 2 grandparents AJ (at least 50% AJ), having 3 grandparents AJ (at least 75% AJ), having 4 grandparents AJ (100%), having 4 grandparents Sephardic/other (100% non-AJ), and in case of missing information on the 4 grandparents, the members were recorded as unknown.

Sociodemographic information was retrieved from the EMR CHS database. It included biological sex, age at index date (years), socioeconomic status (SES; low, medium, high; based on clinic-degree data), population sector (Jewish—general sector, Jewish—ultraorthodox), place of residence (rural, urban), and ethnicity. All the study population characteristics were extracted up to 5 years before the index date.

Descriptive statistics were conducted for the study population, and we compared the characteristics of individuals who underwent the BRCA1/2 screening test with those who did not undergo BRCA1/2 screening. Among the tested individuals, we compared the characteristics of women who were heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants with those carrier status was not positive. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using an unpaired t test and the χ2 test, respectively. Two-sided tests were used, and P value of <.05 was defined as significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using the R language (version 4.1.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Data sources

The data were extracted from CHS, the largest health care provider in Israel, insuring more than half of the Israeli population.

CHS has a comprehensive data warehouse that combines administrative and clinical data from community and hospital records, including demographic information, laboratory results, diagnoses given in a community or hospital setting, clinical and behavioral markers, and medical procedures. The raw data extracted were coded, viewed, and stored only within the Clalit Research Institute.

### Study population and design

We performed a cross-sectional study. The study population includes individuals who were CHS members and met the following eligibility criteria: (1) women, (2) age ≥ 25 years, (3) fully or partially of AJ origin (at least 1 grandparent of AJ by self-report), (4) have no personal history of BRCA1/2-associated cancer (breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer),10,13 and (5) women with no known familial pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene, by self-report.

### Pretest process

Information regarding the implications of the test and the risk of being positive for BRCA1/2 variants were provided by physicians, nurses, or geneticists from various clinics and hospitals. Women who showed interest were required to schedule an appointment to the test.

Two days before the test, participants were provided with a link to an explanatory webpage on the CHS website and an explanatory video through a text message.

The test was performed without requiring pretesting genetic counseling. Upon arrival for the test, participants were provided with an oral explanation by a genetic nurse who had received prior training. Written informed consent, containing information regarding the implications and potential outcomes of the test, was also obtained.

Women with a known first-degree family history of relevant cancer were recommended to undergo genetic counseling alongside the test.

Women who did not meet the eligibility test criteria did not perform the test and were referred for genetic counseling.

### Genetic test

The test was performed at 6 CHS hospitals, and the date of performing the genetic test was defined as the index date. For CHS members who were not tested, the index date was defined as the end of research (July 1, 2022). Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA was extracted with the PureGene kit (Gentra, Inc) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Specimens were analyzed for 14 common pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 in the Israeli population including the known AJ founder variants with NanoCHIP (Gamidor Diagnostics) (Supplemental Table 1).

### Test results

Women positive for BRCA1/2 variants were promptly invited to genetic counseling to receive the test results and follow-up recommendations.

Women whose carrier status was negative were informed of their test results, through a letter, email, or online (based on their preference), along with a written/electronic communication of the implications and recommendations to continue with general follow-up, according to the recommendations of the attending physician. Moreover, they were advised to seek genetic counseling if they had a personal or family history of cancer.

### Ethnicity definition

Self-reported ethnicity was validated based on CHS electronic medical records (EMRs) of maternal and paternal grandparents’ country of birth.15 For each individual, EMR-based ethnicity was derived in a stepwise manner: (1) based on the birth country of each grandparent; (2) if information regarding the grandparent was unavailable, the birth country of the parent was used; and (3) finally, if both were unavailable, the birth country of the patient was used. Each birth country is assigned one of these ethnicities—AJ, Sephardic, Ethiopian Jewish, and Arab.

For this study, the EMR-based ethnicity was divided into 6 groups: having 1 grandparent AJ (at least 25% AJ), having 2 grandparents AJ (at least 50% AJ), having 3 grandparents AJ (at least 75% AJ), having 4 grandparents AJ (100%), having 4 grandparents Sephardic/other (100% non-AJ), and in case of missing information on the 4 grandparents, the members were recorded as unknown.

### Baseline measurements

Sociodemographic information was retrieved from the EMR CHS database. It included biological sex, age at index date (years), socioeconomic status (SES; low, medium, high; based on clinic-degree data), population sector (Jewish—general sector, Jewish—ultraorthodox), place of residence (rural, urban), and ethnicity. All the study population characteristics were extracted up to 5 years before the index date.

### Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were conducted for the study population, and we compared the characteristics of individuals who underwent the BRCA1/2 screening test with those who did not undergo BRCA1/2 screening. Among the tested individuals, we compared the characteristics of women who were heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants with those carrier status was not positive. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using an unpaired t test and the χ2 test, respectively. Two-sided tests were used, and P value of <.05 was defined as significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using the R language (version 4.1.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Results

During the study period, of 420,418 women at CHS who met criteria for testing, 13,502 underwent screening for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants. Most of the tested women (carrier status both positive and negative) were in the age group of 25 to 44 years (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). The overall frequency of individuals positive for BRCA1/2 variants was 0.89% (120 of 13,502). Among women from different age groups, we did not find significant difference in BRCA1/2 carrier frequency (P = .14). Specifically, the carrier frequency among younger women (aged 25-44 years) was 0.98% (83 of 8464), whereas the carrier frequency among older women (aged 45-65 years) was 0.73% (37 of 5038) (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2).Table 1Sociodemographic characteristics of the study populationCharacteristicEligible PopulationN = 420,418Tested n = 13,502Not Tested, n = 406,916P ValueaAge, mean (SD)b52 (18)43 (12)53 (19)<.001Age category, n (%)b<.001 25-3483,594 (20)3747 (28)79,847 (20) 35-4495,683 (23)4717 (35)90,966 (22) 45-5462,419 (15)2608 (19)59,811 (15) 55-6456,590 (13)1327 (9.8)55,263 (14) 65+122,132 (29)1103 (8.2)121,029 (30)Ethnicity, n (%)b<.001 AJ416,106 (99)9190 (68)406,916 (100) At least 25%23,162 (5.5)854 (6.3)22,308 (5.5) At least 50%89,342 (21)3285 (24)86,057 (21) At least 75%9932 (2.4)562 (4.2)9370 (2.3) 100% AJ293,670 (70)4489 (33)289,181 (71) 100% Sephardic169 (0.1)169 (1.4)– Unknown/other4143 (1.0)4143 (31)–Sector, n (%)<.001 Jewish, general397,969 (95)13,224 (98)384,745 (95) Jewish, ultraorthodox21,322 (5.1)251 (1.9)21,071 (5.2) Other1127 (0.3)27 (0.2)1100 (0.3)Place of residence, n (%)<.001 Rural52,527 (13)3220 (24)49,307 (12) Urban366,180 (87)10,173 (76)356,007 (88) (Missing)17111091602Socioeconomic status, n (%)<.001 Low216,439 (51)3288 (24)213,151 (52) Medium195,081 (46)9681 (72)185,400 (46) High8777 (2.1)530 (3.9)8247 (2) (Missing)1213118AJ, Ashkenazi Jewish; CHS, Clalit Health Services.aSignificant difference with P < .05.bMean (SD); n (%); Median (IQR).

According to the EMR, the carrier frequency for AJ were 0.96% (89 of 9190), 1.18% (2 of 169) for Sephardic, and 0.69% (29 of 4143) for women of unknown origin. The carrier frequency for the various degrees of AJ origin were as follows: 1.02% (46 of 4489) for full AJ, 1.6% (9 of 562) for at least 75% AJ, 0.94% (31 of 3285) for at least 50% AJ, and 0.35% (3 of 854) for at least 25% AJ (Figure 1).Figure 1Study population flowchart.

Of the 14 variants included in the screening test, only 6 variants were detected among our tested population. Unsurprisingly, among AJ, the 3 known founder variants were the most common with the BRCA2 c.5946del variant being the most common (64, 53%), followed by BRCA1 c.68_69del (42, 35%) and BRCA1 c.5266dup (10, 8.4%). The remaining variants identified by the screening test included the BRCA2 c.7007G>C variant (2, 1.7%) and the BRCA1 c.181T>G in and BRCA2 c.2158G>T variants (1, 0.8% each). As expected, no variant was detected in a homozygous or compound heterozygous state in this healthy population.

The age, ethnicity, sector, SES, and type of residence of tested women (n = 13,502) and the eligible non-tested women (n = 406,916) were compared. The average age was lower among the tested individuals (mean = 43, SD = 12) compared with the eligible not tested group (mean = 53, SD = 19). Among the tested cohort, younger women had a lower rate of full AJ ancestry compared with older women (Figure 2).Figure 2The distribution of AJ degree by age group, tested vs nontested individuals.

Additionally, most of the tested women were from medium-high SES (76%), and only 24% were from low SES. Nevertheless, only 6% (3220 of 52,527) of the low SES eligible population underwent the screening test. Overall, out of the total eligible population, the compliance of individuals from urban area was higher (76%) compared with individuals from a rural area (24%). However, when considering the compliance in relation to the population sizes of rural and urban areas, a higher percentage of women underwent the test in rural areas-6.1% (3220 of 52,527) compared to urban areas-2.8% (10,173 of 366,180). Following this, only 1.9% of the tested women were orthodox, and only 1.17% (251 of 21,322) from the eligible orthodox population were tested (Table 1).

### Discussion

Screening programs for early detection of breast and ovarian cancer have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Individuals who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants are at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, and advances in knowledge, technology, and patient awareness have led to the identification of more BRCA1/2 heterozygotes than in the past. The prognosis of individuals screening positive for BRCA1/2 variants has improved because of prevention and early detection programs, the use of prophylactic medication (eg, tamoxifen), and even targeted treatments such as Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.16 Yet, many individuals who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants remain incognito and unaware of a positive carrier status. Therefore, better testing strategies are required, as well as a reassessment of the current strategy, in which only women with high risk because of AJ origin or a family history are recommended to be tested.

Our results indicate that the carrier frequency of the 3 AJ founder variants in BRCA1/2 is 0.95% (88 of 9190) among all AJ groups and 1.02% (46 of 4489) among the full AJ group. These frequencies are lower than the reported frequency in previous studies (2.5%).9,10 In contrast to these studies, our cohort included women from varying degrees of AJ and only unaffected women, without known familial BRCA1/2 variant, who inherently have a lower carrier frequency compared with affected women and those with known familial BRCA1/2 variant. In addition, we excluded men, who rarely have breast cancer and should therefore have a higher carrier frequency compared with a parallel unaffected women cohort. Nevertheless, more recent studies that used inclusion and exclusion criteria that were more similar to our study (eg, unaffected women, without known family history of BRCA1/2 variant, tested women age ranges) reported more similar prevalence rates—1.3% to 1.8%.17, 18, 19Similarly, our carrier frequency was lower than that reported in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v2.1.1, for AJ women without cancer20: BRCA1 c.5266dup (0.3%, n = 4676 alleles); BRCA1 c.68_69del (0.3%, n = 4676 alleles), and BRCA2, c.5946del (0.57%, n = 4672 alleles). However, the carrier frequency was more similar when comparing our findings with the carrier frequencies in gnomAD v3.1.2: BRCA1 c.5266dup (0.0%, n = 1744 alleles; 0.03% in the CHS group),21
BRCA1 c.68_69del (0.11%, N = 1744 alleles; 0.15% in the CHS group),22 and BRCA2 c.5946del (0.23% n = 1744 alleles; 0.23% in the CHS group).23 This may stem from the difference in ancestry assignment methodology between the 2 gnomAD versions. Specifically, the models for ancestry assignment were developed using different data sets, and different probability thresholds for assignment were used (90% in v2.1.1 vs 75% in v3.1.2).20, 21, 22, 23 This difference in probability thresholds suggests that the population composition is more heterogeneous in gnomAD v3.1.2 and therefore more closely resembles our cohort, compared with v2.1.1 and previous studies.

Although, 14 BRCA1/2 variants were tested, the 3 known BRCA1/2 founder variants in AJ were found in 96.6%. In light of these findings, in the setting of a screening test, it might be more efficient to consider testing individuals of full AJ only for these 3 founder variants. However, the admixture of populations that continue to grow, may cause, over time, to miss many carriers and create a false reassurance. Therefore, we expect broad testing of known and common pathogenic variants in the population and even a full sequencing of BRCA1/2 genes to become the most efficient screening method while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

The well-known success of the Israeli carrier screening programs for reproductive purposes24 demonstrates the Israeli public’s interest in proactive genetics tests. Therefore, the relatively low compliance to the BRCA1/2 carrier screening (3%) calls for an evaluation of the behavioral factors that may influence the compliance rate and for ways to increase compliance.

In our study, women from the general Jewish population, with higher SES, were more likely to get tested than those with lower SES. This finding is consistent with previous studies and demonstrates that there is a positive relationship between SES and health-seeking behavior.25

Considering the potential impact of population characteristics, including an older population, lower SES, and variations in health-seeking behavior,25 among others, the variation in compliance rate, may also be explained by the limited accessibility to health services. However, further investigation is needed. These results demonstrate that measures and decisions should be taken by policy makers to design strategies that will increase awareness and accessibility of tests and address any issues preventing women from completing this important screening.

In summary, this large-scale real-world study revealed that the carrier frequency of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants is lower than reported in previous studies, but it is still substantial. Even when considering the lower carrier frequency detected in this large-scale study, previous studies have shown that it still supports its cost-effectiveness.26,27

Our findings show that younger women have a lower rate of full AJ origin compared with older women and a higher frequency of those heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants. As the admixture of populations continue to grow, determining an woman’s precise origin is expected to be increasingly challenging. Therefore, expanding the carrier screening test to include women of diverse origins, rather than just women of AJ origin, should be considered.

Finally, the higher prevalence rate of women who are heterozygous for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants among younger women (25-45 years), as well as the low compliance among women with lower SES, emphasizes the importance of reexamining the current strategy. Increasing compliance among these populations will exhaust the advantage of early detection to reduce morbidity and mortality and, as a result, will improve the cost-effectiveness of this screening program.
