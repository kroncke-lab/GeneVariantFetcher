## The Novel Pathogenic Mutation c.849dupT in BRCA2 Contributes to the Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay of BRCA2 in Familial Breast Cancer

### Abstract

In this study, we used next-generation sequencing methods to screen 300 individuals for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A novel mutation (c.849dupT) in BRCA2 was identified in a female patient and her unaffected brothers. This mutation leads to the truncation of BRCA2 functional domains. Moreover, BRCA2 mRNA expression levels in mutation carriers are significantly reduced compared to noncarriers. Immunofluorescence and western blot assays showed that this mutation resulted in reduced BRCA2 protein expression. Thus, we identified a novel mutation that damaged the function and expression of BRCA2 in a family with breast cancer history. The pedigree analysis suggested that this mutation is strongly associated with familial breast cancer. Genetic counsellors suggest that mutation carriers in this family undergo routine screening for breast cancer, as well as other malignancies, such as prostate and ovarian cancer. The effects of this BRCA2 mutation on drug resistance should be taken into consideration during treatment.
