## Characteristics of breast cancer patients tested for germline BRCA1/2 mutations by next‐generation sequencing in Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University

### Abstract

AbstractIntroductionGermline mutations in BRCA1/2 are the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome. Few studies published during the past decade reported the prevalence of germline BRCA mutations in Asian patients with breast cancer. We aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of Thai patients with breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all breast cancer patients who were tested for germline BRCA1/2 mutations during 2014–2018. BRCA mutations were detected using next‐generation sequencing and confirmed using Sanger sequencing. We analyzed the characteristics of patients with or without BRCA mutations. Disease‐free survival (DFS) and the associated factors were determined.ResultsAmong 67 patients, 12 (18%) were BRCA1/2 carriers (6 each), 4 (6%) harbored variants of uncertain significance, and 51 (76%) were non‐carriers. We discovered two novel BRCA2 frameshift mutations (c.2380delA and c.8855dupT). Mean ages at breast cancer diagnosis of BRCA1, BRCA2, and non‐carriers were 39.8, 46.2, and 42.0 years, respectively. The 12 tumors of BRCA carriers were mainly the luminal‐B subtype. Two of these tumors were HER2‐positive luminal‐B, and the triple‐negative subtype was not detected. After adjusting for stages and luminal subtypes, BRCA carriers experienced worse 3‐year DFS than non‐carriers (81.5% vs. 90.3%, HR 2.04 [0.64–6.49], p = .229). The stage at diagnosis was the sole factor significantly associated with 3‐year DFS (100%, 84.8%, and 72.7%; stages I, II, and III, respectively).ConclusionThai patients with breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutations were mainly the luminal‐B subtypes with worse prognosis than those without mutations.

### INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females in most countries.
1
 In Thailand, breast cancer is the third most frequent cancer and the third most common cause of cancer death of both sexes.
2
 Breast cancer, which primarily occurs in women and 1% of men, is typically acquired through multistep accumulations of somatic mutations, whereas 5%–10% of breast cancers are inherited through germline mutations. Germline mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are the most common causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome.
3
 A large prospective study found that women who inherit deleterious germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 have very high cumulative risks for developing breast cancer (e.g., risks to 80‐year‐olds are 72% and 69% for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, respectively).
4

The main characteristics of patients with breast cancer with BRCA mutations include a family history of breast cancer, younger age at diagnosis, male breast cancer, or multiple tumors (bilateral breast cancer or breast and ovarian cancer) in the same patient.
5
 Furthermore, patients with BRCA1 mutations are most commonly younger at diagnosis and associated with the triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. In contrast, patients with BRCA2 mutations are mainly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive breast cancer.

 Furthermore, a more advanced stage at diagnosis and the presence of multiple foci of breast cancers are more common in patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations than in patients with sporadic tumors. Abundant data show that patients with breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA carriers) experience higher mortality rates than non‐carriers.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes located at chromosomes 17q21 and 13q12.3, respectively.
9
, 
10
, 
11
, 
12
 BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are essential for repairing DNA‐double strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination, cell growth regulation, and control of cell division.

,

, 
14
 Genetic alterations of these genes occur in 5% of all breast cancers and 15%–25% of familial breast cancers worldwide.
7
, 
15
 The prevalence and phenotype of BRCA mutations vary according to country and race. The prevalence of BRCA mutations depends on the risk of breast cancer development; namely, a low prevalence in patients with sporadic breast cancer but higher in selected high‐risk cases such as breast cancer with a strong family history, bilateral breast cancer, and multiple organ cancer. Only a few studies have investigated the prevalence of BRCA mutations in Asian patients with breast cancer. Data from Korea shows a BRCA1/2 prevalence of 8.9% in high‐risk patients without family history and 22.3% in patients with family history.
16
 In China, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 in high‐risk patients is 9.1%, but only 3.5% in sporadic breast cancer patients.
17
 Similarly, there is limited data on the prevalence and characteristics of BRCA‐associated breast cancer in Thailand. Only two studies have investigated BRCA1/2 mutations in selected Thai patients with breast cancer with and without familial history of HBOC.
18
, 
19
 One group of investigators in Thailand used the Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method to screen for BRCA1/2 large genomic rearrangement in Thai patients with familial breast cancer; they only found BRCA1 alteration in 1% of high‐risk patients with breast cancer.
19

Before the approval of a poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for patients with breast cancer with BRCA mutations,
20
 few testing sites were available in Thailand. This is likely explained by the limited number of testing laboratories, the lack of geneticists offering pre‐and post‐test counseling, and costly out‐of‐pocket payments.

The Center for Medical Genomics (CMG) Ramathibodi Hospital started using NGS for routine BRCA mutation testing in 2014. The number of BRCA mutation testing services in Thailand recently increased since the approval of PARP inhibitors as the treatment for cancers with BRCA mutations. The present study explored the prevalence and characteristics of breast cancers in Thai patients tested for germline BRCA1/2 mutations.

### PATIENTS AND METHODS

We first screened all patients tested for germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 at the CMG Ramathibodi Hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. We excluded patients with cancers other than breast cancer or patients with breast cancer who enrolled in other clinical studies; we also excluded those whose data in the electronic medical records (EMRs) of Ramathibodi Hospital were unavailable. The EMRs were retrospectively reviewed. We collected demographic data at diagnosis, including sex, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and TNM staging according to AJCC 8th edition.
21
 Besides, we also collected tumor characteristics, including pathological subtype, histological grading, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), and Ki‐67 status as described in the pathological reports. There are some variations from time to time in the reporting systems for ER and PR immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. In the present study, ER and PR were considered negative if the nuclei of tumor cells were stained <1%. HER2 expression was routinely classified as negative (0, 1+), equivocal (2+), or positive (3+) via IHC staining intensity. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to confirm and document registration for trastuzumab reimbursement. Luminal subtypes were classified according to the Saint Gallen Guidelines 2015.
22
 Treatments and outcomes such as surgical management, adjuvant therapies, recurrent/metastasis of disease, secondary primary cancer, and death were also collected.

The Ethics Committee on Human Rights related to research involving human subjects, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University approved this study (MURA2019/988).

Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of patients. Analyses of germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were performed using NGS at the CMG. All coding regions in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were sequenced, and aligned with the Homo sapiens genome assembly GRCh37 (hg19) published by the Genome Reference Consortium.

24
 Sequence variants were classified in decreasing order of clinical importance as “Pathogenic,” “Likely pathogenic,” “Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS),” “Likely benign,” or “Benign,” according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Standards and Guidelines.
25
 Selected variants identified as “Pathogenic” or “Likely pathogenic” were verified using Sanger sequencing. All Sanger sequencing results confirmed that the selected Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic variants were genuinely present in the samples.

Descriptive statistical analysis was used to describe patients' characteristics. Clinical characteristics were expressed as numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and continuous data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons of characteristics between carriers of BRCA1/2 and non‐carriers were performed using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and one‐way analysis of variance for continuous variables; p‐value <.05 indicates a significant difference. Disease‐free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of the first event (local recurrence or distant metastasis, second primary cancer, or death from any cause). Patients who were alive without disease recurrence were censored at the cut‐off date (December 31, 2019). Median DFS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. To identify prognostic factors of DFS, we applied Cox regression analysis. BRCA status, stage at diagnosis, and luminal subtypes, along with variables with p‐value less than .1 from the univariate Cox regression model, were adjusted by multivariate analysis. Stata software, version 16, was applied to perform all analyses.

### RESULTS

One hundred forty‐two patients had been tested for germline mutations of BRCA1/2 using NGS at CMG from January 2014 to December 2018. Seventy‐five patients were excluded for reasons, as described in Figure 1. Finally, 67 patients with breast cancer were included in this study. The majority of the included patients (51, 76.1%) were at high risk for HBOC (diagnosed with breast cancer at ≤40 years or TNBC at ≤60 years, male breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers).

Patient selection

Pathogenic BRCA mutations confirmed using Sanger sequencing were detected in 12 (17.9%) patients (6 BRCA1 carriers and 6 BRCA2 carriers). VUS were detected in 4 (6.0%) patients, and the others were BRCA non‐carriers. The confirmed 12 BRCA1/2 mutations included five frameshifts, four nonsense, two at splice acceptor positions, and one missense. The positions of these BRCA1/2 mutations are shown in Figure 2. The mutations of BRCA2 were more widely distributed across exonic regions than those of BRCA1. The six pathogenic mutations of BRCA1 were located as follows: 3 in exon 10 and 3 in exon 16. The six pathogenic mutations of BRCA2 were located as follows: 3 in exon 11, 2 in exon 22, and 1 in exon 25.

The ATG translation initiation sites and termination codons are indicated by longer lines. Black letters = pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2, Blue letters = VUS in BRCA2.

We discovered two novel frameshift mutations, which have not been reported in any available database (HGMD, ClinVar, dbSNP, gnomAD, etc.), in BRCA2 [c.2380delA (p.Met794Cysfs) and c.8855dupT (p.Met2952Ilefs)]. We detected another BRCA2 mutation [c.8888_8889insA (p.Arg2964Lysfs)] reported in previous studies from China and Singapore.

 The other nine mutations detected here were reported in previous studies of patients residing in Asia, the United States, and Europe (ClinVar

). The characteristics of the BRCA carriers and associated mutations are presented in Table 1. We detected five VUS of BRCA2 in four of 67 (6.0%) patients. All were missense mutations, and one of the patients carried two VUS. VUS were not detectable in BRCA1 (Figure 2).

Among 67 patients, 98.5% were female, except one male with breast cancer who was a BRCA non‐carrier. The mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 42.0 ± 10.3 years (BRCA1, 39.8 ± 7.4 years; BRCA2, 46.2 ± 16.0 years). Among 10 (14.9%) patients with bilateral breast cancer, 4 had synchronous lesions, and 6 had metachronous lesions. Most patients presented with early‐stage breast cancer, and 50% had stage II disease. BRCA carriers and VUS patients tended to be luminal B subtypes, whereas the most common tumor subtype of non‐carriers was TNBC (27.4%), followed by the HER2‐negative luminal‐B subtype (21.6%). Patients' demographic data are presented in Table 2.

Surgery was performed on 98.5% of patients, including mastectomy (n = 51) and breast‐conserving surgery (BCS; n = 15). Almost all BRCA carriers underwent mastectomy, except one who underwent BCS and was subsequently found to harbor a BRCA mutation. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 56.7% of patients for locally advanced breast cancer (T3–T4) and lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was provided to 66% of patients; 19 (28.4%) patients received only anthracycline‐based chemotherapy, 16 (23.9%) patients received sequential treatment with anthracycline‐based followed by a taxane, two patients received taxane‐based chemotherapy, and seven patients received other regimens. Platinum‐based adjuvant chemotherapy was not used. Patients with hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer underwent adjuvant endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab was used as a 1‐year adjuvant treatment for 16 confirmed HER2‐positive patients.

Among 12 tumors of BRCA carriers, eight were the HER2‐negative luminal‐B, two were the HER2‐positive luminal‐B subtype, and two unclassified (whose breast cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and 2003, and the result of hormonal receptor and HER2 were not available). Unexpectedly, the TNBC subtype was not observed among the BRCA carriers. The clinicopathological features of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers were summarized in Supplementary 1.

The results of the subgroup analysis of BRCA non‐carriers are shown in Supplementary 2. Overall, there were no significant differences in clinical and pathological characteristics between early‐onset (≤40 years) and late‐onset (>40 years) patients; however, early‐onset patients received adjuvant chemotherapy at a significantly higher frequency compared with late‐onset patients (p = .017). Early‐onset patients tended to have higher grades and stages compared with late‐onset patients.

At the cut‐off date (December 31, 2019), the median follow‐up was 2.7 years (range 0.2–17.2 years), 51 patients were disease‐free, 16 experienced a second primary tumor (n = 8), distant metastases (n = 7), or local recurrence (n = 1). Among the seven patients who developed metastasis, two were BRCA carriers, 1 had VUS, and four were BRCA non‐carriers; six patients received palliative chemotherapy, and one patient received palliative endocrine therapy. One BRCA carrier received platinum‐based chemotherapy followed by a PARP inhibitor, and another BRCA carrier received anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.

The 3‐year DFS rate was 87.7% (Table 3). BRCA1/2 carriers had lower 3‐year DFS rates vs non‐carriers, although the difference was not statistically significant (81.5% vs. 90.3%, hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.04 (0.64–6.49); p = .229). Similarly, patients with VUS had inferior 3‐year DFS compared with non‐carriers (79.0% vs. 90.3%; HR (95% CI), 1.60 (0.20–12.99); p = .658). TNM staging was a significant prognostic factor for 3‐year DFS, with higher stage associated with lower 3‐year DFS. Three‐year DFS rates were 100%, 84.8%, and 72.7% for stages I, II, and III, respectively, with HR (95% CI), 2.88 (0.73–11.33); p = .131 and 6.82 (1.12–41.33); p = .037 for stages II and III compared with stage I, respectively.

After adjusting for the TNM stage and luminal subtypes using multivariable Cox regression analysis, BRCA1/2 carriers had inferior DFS compared with non‐carriers, although the difference was not statistically significant, HR (95% CI), 2.50 (0.48, 12.97); p = .275. Similarly, patients with VUS had inferior DFS compared with non‐carriers, HR (95% CI), 1.25 (0.12–12.81); p = .852. After adjustments in multivariate analysis, the TNM stage at diagnosis remained significantly associated with 3‐year DFS. Stages II and III had inferior DFS compared with stage I, HR (95% CI), 6.32 (0.90–44.48); p = .064 and 16.30 (1.38–192.81); p = .027, respectively (Table 3).

### Pathogenic germline mutations of BRCA1/2

One hundred forty‐two patients had been tested for germline mutations of BRCA1/2 using NGS at CMG from January 2014 to December 2018. Seventy‐five patients were excluded for reasons, as described in Figure 1. Finally, 67 patients with breast cancer were included in this study.

### Patients' clinical characteristics and DFS

Among 67 patients, 98.5% were female, except one male with breast cancer who was a BRCA non‐carrier. The mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 42.0 ± 10.3 years (BRCA1, 39.8 ± 7.4 years; BRCA2, 46.2 ± 16.0 years). Among 10 (14.9%) patients with bilateral breast cancer, 4 had synchronous lesions, and 6 had metachronous lesions. Most patients presented with early‐stage breast cancer, and 50% had stage II disease. BRCA carriers and VUS patients tended to be luminal B subtypes, whereas the most common tumor subtype of non‐carriers was TNBC (27.4%), followed by the HER2‐negative luminal‐B subtype (21.6%). Patients' demographic data are presented in Table 2.

Abbreviations: BCS, breast conservation surgery; ECOG‐PS, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group‐Performance status; ER, estrogen receptor; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; SD, standard deviation; TNBC, triple‐negative breast cancer.

Surgery was performed on 98.5% of patients, including mastectomy (n = 51) and breast‐conserving surgery (BCS; n = 15). Almost all BRCA carriers underwent mastectomy, except one who underwent BCS and was subsequently found to harbor a BRCA mutation. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 56.7% of patients for locally advanced breast cancer (T3–T4) and lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was provided to 66% of patients; 19 (28.4%) patients received only anthracycline‐based chemotherapy, 16 (23.9%) patients received sequential treatment with anthracycline‐based followed by a taxane, two patients received taxane‐based chemotherapy, and seven patients received other regimens. Platinum‐based adjuvant chemotherapy was not used. Patients with hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer underwent adjuvant endocrine therapy. Trastuzumab was used as a 1‐year adjuvant treatment for 16 confirmed HER2‐positive patients.

Among 12 tumors of BRCA carriers, eight were the HER2‐negative luminal‐B, two were the HER2‐positive luminal‐B subtype, and two unclassified (whose breast cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and 2003, and the result of hormonal receptor and HER2 were not available). Unexpectedly, the TNBC subtype was not observed among the BRCA carriers. The clinicopathological features of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers were summarized in Supplementary 1.

The results of the subgroup analysis of BRCA non‐carriers are shown in Supplementary 2. Overall, there were no significant differences in clinical and pathological characteristics between early‐onset (≤40 years) and late‐onset (>40 years) patients; however, early‐onset patients received adjuvant chemotherapy at a significantly higher frequency compared with late‐onset patients (p = .017). Early‐onset patients tended to have higher grades and stages compared with late‐onset patients.

At the cut‐off date (December 31, 2019), the median follow‐up was 2.7 years (range 0.2–17.2 years), 51 patients were disease‐free, 16 experienced a second primary tumor (n = 8), distant metastases (n = 7), or local recurrence (n = 1). Among the seven patients who developed metastasis, two were BRCA carriers, 1 had VUS, and four were BRCA non‐carriers; six patients received palliative chemotherapy, and one patient received palliative endocrine therapy. One BRCA carrier received platinum‐based chemotherapy followed by a PARP inhibitor, and another BRCA carrier received anthracycline and cyclophosphamide.

The 3‐year DFS rate was 87.7% (Table 3). BRCA1/2 carriers had lower 3‐year DFS rates vs non‐carriers, although the difference was not statistically significant (81.5% vs. 90.3%, hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.04 (0.64–6.49); p = .229). Similarly, patients with VUS had inferior 3‐year DFS compared with non‐carriers (79.0% vs. 90.3%; HR (95% CI), 1.60 (0.20–12.99); p = .658). TNM staging was a significant prognostic factor for 3‐year DFS, with higher stage associated with lower 3‐year DFS. Three‐year DFS rates were 100%, 84.8%, and 72.7% for stages I, II, and III, respectively, with HR (95% CI), 2.88 (0.73–11.33); p = .131 and 6.82 (1.12–41.33); p = .037 for stages II and III compared with stage I, respectively.

After adjusting for the TNM stage and luminal subtypes using multivariable Cox regression analysis, BRCA1/2 carriers had inferior DFS compared with non‐carriers, although the difference was not statistically significant, HR (95% CI), 2.50 (0.48, 12.97); p = .275. Similarly, patients with VUS had inferior DFS compared with non‐carriers, HR (95% CI), 1.25 (0.12–12.81); p = .852. After adjustments in multivariate analysis, the TNM stage at diagnosis remained significantly associated with 3‐year DFS. Stages II and III had inferior DFS compared with stage I, HR (95% CI), 6.32 (0.90–44.48); p = .064 and 16.30 (1.38–192.81); p = .027, respectively (Table 3).

### DISCUSSION

Among 67 patients included in the present study, we detected 6 (8.95%) BRCA1 carriers, 6 (8.95%) BRCA2 carriers, 4 (6.0%) patients with VUS, as well as 51 (76.1%) non‐carriers. Within 12 BRCA carriers, most had tumors with luminal‐B subtypes (8 HER2‐negative luminal‐B, 2 HER2‐positive luminal‐B, and 2 unclassified due to missing data for hormonal receptor and HER2). BRCA carriers had inferior 3‐year DFS than non‐carriers, although the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for TNM stage and luminal subtype. The TNM stage at diagnosis was the only significant factor associated with 3‐year DFS (higher stage lower 3‐year DFS).

The majority of the previous reports from Thailand focused on BRCA in ovarian cancer.

 and another study screened for BRCA1/2 large genomic rearrangement with MLPA method in high‐risk patients with familial breast cancer.

 Our present retrospective study documents the prevalence and clinical characteristics of Thai patients with breast cancer, including BRCA carriers, non‐carriers, and those with VUS as detected by NGS. Although most studies on BRCA1/2 mutations involved non‐Asian populations,

 retrospective studies of high‐risk Asian populations showed the frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations between 2.3%–18.6% and 2.3%–11.4%, respectively.

 Furthermore, data from Korea demonstrated the prevalence of BRCA1/2 carriers in high‐risk patients with or without familial history of breast cancer between 8.9% and 22.3%,
16
 while the prevalence of BRCA1/2 carriers in high‐risk Chinese population is 9.1%.
17
 Here, we showed the frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in high‐risk Thai patients at 8.95% and 8.95%, respectively, consistent with the previous studies of Asian and non‐Asian populations.

It is well accepted that family history, age at diagnosis, and race are predictive factors for the probability of an individual carrying a germline BRCA1/2 mutation.

 Whereas the mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 carriers and non‐carriers was similar in the present study, the age at diagnosis of breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers was lower than that of BRCA2 carriers (39.8 vs. 46.2 years), consistent with previous studies showing the age at diagnosis of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers ranging between 30 and 45 years.

 In the subject of bilateral breast cancer, BRCA1/2 carriers have a higher risk of developing contralateral or second primary breast cancer, with long‐term risks ranging from 60% to 70%.
37
 In the present study, we found 3 out of 12 patients (25%) with BRCA1/2 mutations had bilateral breast cancer (one with metachronous bilateral breast cancer and two with synchronous bilateral breast cancer). This was similar to a previous study in Korea finding 22.1% of BRCA1/2 carriers with bilateral breast cancer.
38
 In term of breast cancer subtype, BRCA1 carriers is typically associated with the TNBC subtype, and hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer is common in BRCA2 carriers.

 HER2 overexpression has been detected only in 0%–8% of BRCA‐associated breast cancer, lower than in sporadic breast cancer.
37
 Consistent with previous studies, all of BRCA2 carriers in our study were associated with luminal‐B tumors. But we did not find TNBC in BRCA1 carriers from our study. Therefore, we should consider testing for BRCA germline mutations in patients suspected of HBOC presenting with luminal subtype breast cancer; this is relevant because BRCA carriers are candidates for specific treatments (platinum‐based chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors) which would increase response rates and prolong survival. Such patients with BRCA mutations are candidates for screening for BRCA‐associated cancer other than breast cancer to detect the early‐stage disease.

The outcomes of breast cancer in BRCA carriers were conflicting. Previous systematic reviews and meta‐analysis found significantly worse overall survival (OS) of BRCA carriers than non‐carriers, although the difference in recurrence‐free survival is not statistically significant.

, 
42
 Other studies conducted in France and Switzerland found significantly superior 5‐year DFS of BRCA1 carriers than non‐carriers, but not significant for BRCA2 carriers.
43
 In contrast, a study conducted in Korea found significantly inferior 10‐year DFS and more contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1/2 carriers than non‐carriers, but no significant difference in 10‐year OS.
44
 Furthermore, a study of Korean patients found that clinical nodal status is the only significant factor associated with DFS, even after adjusting for clinical nodal stage, BRCA status, hormonal receptor status, and Ki‐67. Consistent with these findings, adjusted multivariable analysis in the present study revealed that the only significant factor associated with DFS was the stage at diagnosis, whereas BRCA1/2 carriers had inferior DFS compared with BRCA non‐carriers; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In the future, the treatment outcome of BRCA‐associate breast cancer should be better due to the availability of PARP inhibitors that have been approved for use as a treatment for advanced germline BRCA‐mutated breast cancer
20
, 
45
 and for adjuvant therapy in selected patients with early stage breast cancer who had germline BRCA mutation.

The strength of this study is the use of reliable and comprehensive NGS techniques to analyze BRCA sequences. Using NGS, novel genetic alterations could be found and graded. However, our study has some limitations, such as its retrospective analysis of patients tested at a single institution which primarily relied on affordable patients despite the indications for germline BRCA testing according to the NCCN guideline. Thus, it may not represent the true prevalence of BRCA mutation in Thai patients. Moreover, we could not identify a significant association between BRCA status and clinical outcomes because of the study's relatively small sample size. A multicenter prospective study with more subjects is required to identify the prevalence of germline BRCA mutations in Thai breast cancer patients.

### CONCLUSION

In summary, this study describes the characteristics, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients with breast cancer treated at a single university hospital in Thailand. We found that breast cancer in BRCA carriers was significantly associated with the luminal‐B subtype. For clinical outcome, the difference of DFS between BRCA1, BRCA2 carriers, and non‐carriers cannot be demonstrated from this small sample size with a short follow‐up cohort. A longer follow‐up of this study is required to determine the long‐term survival outcomes.
