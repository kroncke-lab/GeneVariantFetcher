## Benign polymorphisms in the 
BRCA
 genes with linkage disequilibrium is associated with cancer characteristics

### Abstract

AbstractGermline pathogenic mutation of the BRCA gene increases the prevalence of breast cancer. Reports on the benign variants of BRCA genes are limited. However, the definition of these variants might be altered with the accumulation of clinical evidence. Therefore, in the present study, we focused on benign single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BRCA genes. Linkage disequilibrium was calculated from whole genome sequencing of the BRCA genes obtained from 500 healthy controls and 49 breast cancer patients. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the mutation. The linkage disequilibrium was noted for seven and three SNPs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively. Breast cancer with BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with a personal history of benign diseases or family history of cancer. Nevertheless, breast cancer with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was correlated with high tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive extensive intraductal components. The patients with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium tended to have worse disease‐specific survival. Cancers with BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium are associated with a lower ratio of grade III cancer. Moreover, patients with BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium tended to have better overall survival. In conclusion, linkage disequilibrium from benign SNPs of the BRCA genes potentially affects cancer characteristics.

### INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer, the most common malignancy occurring in Taiwan women, is the fourth leading cause of cancer‐related deaths.
1
 The two major susceptibility genes of breast and ovarian cancers are BRCA1 and BRCA2. The carriers of BRCA1 germline pathogenic mutation increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers to 57% and 40%, respectively, by age 70. Those with a BRCA2 pathological mutation have 49% and 18% risks of developing breast and ovarian cancers, respectively.
2
 In Asia, <5% of all breast cancer patients have germline mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. Screening high risk or familial breast cancer patients facilitates the identification of those with BRCA mutations. The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in familial breast cancer patients ranges from 9.3% to 23.8% and from 9.0% to 19.0%, respectively, in Korea. In Chinese patients with familial breast cancer, the frequency of BRCA1 mutations ranges from 0% to 7.1% and that of BRCA2 ranges from 0% to 6.6%. The incidence of BRCA1 mutations among Indian women with familial breast cancer ranges from 2.9% to 25% and that of BRCA2 ranges from 0% to 4.6%.
3
 The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations varies among different ethnic populations of familial breast cancer.

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BRCA genes have been identified in previous studies.
2
, 
3
 The prevalence of BRCA pathogenic variants in Taiwanese patients with breast cancer is 3.8% and 0.53% in non‐cancer individuals of the general population.
4
 The age of cancer onset is earlier in BRCA mutation carriers than in non‐BRCA controls (43.9 vs. 53.2 years). Breast cancer patients with a BRCA mutation have a higher risk of developing contralateral breast cancer.
5
 Only the BRCA mutation carriers with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a better survival at 2 years postoperatively, indicating that the benefit is not long term. However, the disease‐free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) are similar between BRCA mutation carriers and cancer patients in several studies.
5
, 
6
 In other studies on breast cancer, BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to have a more advanced breast cancer initially with a worse outcome.
7
, 
8
 The presence of a BRCA mutation also increases risk of developing other cancers, including pancreatic, uterine, gastric, or prostate cancer.
9

BRCA mutation carriers with endometrioid cancer or pancreatic ductal carcinoma are more sensitive to platinum.
10
, 
11
 However, those with prostate cancer have an aggressive cancer type, higher ratio of nodal involvement, more distant metastasis, and a worse outcome.
12
 Moreover, BRCA mutation carriers have a high risk of developing breast cancer and other types of cancer with uncertain effects on survival.

BRCA genetic testing includes a germline study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or oral mucosal cells, and a somatic study of cancer specimen. Germline BRCA1 mutations is 9.7% in HER2‐negative metastatic breast cancer, and somatic BRCA2 mutation is 6.3% in global BREAKOUT study.
13

BRCA proteins repair double‐strand DNA break (DSB) through a homologous recombination to maintain the genomic integrity.
14

BRCA mutation also results in a loss of protein function, genomic instability, oncogenic transformation, and tumorigenicity.
15
 The poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein is critical for single‐strand DNA break (SSB) and base excision repairs to retain the DNA integrity during the loss of BRCA function. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) prevent SSB repair, induce DSB accumulation, and lead to cell death via apoptosis.
16
 PARPi preferentially kills cancer cells in those with BRCA mutation over the normal cells.
17
 In clinical practice, the indications for PARPi have increased, including metastatic or early breast cancer patients, those receiving treatments combined with other agents, those with somatic BRCA mutations, and those with DNA homologous recombination repair mutations.
18
 In clinical trial, PARPi considerably prolonged the DFS and OS in metastatic breast cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations.
19
 Metastatic breast cancer patients with somatic BCRA mutations have a partial response to PARPi.
20
 Further study on BRCA mutation will help identify potential candidates for PARPi therapy.

Nonrandom association of two or more SNVs is referred to as a linkage disequilibrium. Sequencing data from genome‐wide studies helped to identify the linkage disequilibrium and to estimate haplotype probabilities for studying genetic association.
21
 Three SNVs of the BRCA1 gene (rs1799966, rs1799950, and rs16941) forming a linkage disequilibrium are identified in five glioblastoma multiform patients.
22
 Two major haplotypes from three SNVs located in intron 8, exon 13, and intron 18 of the BRCA1 gene are identified in high‐risk breast and ovarian cancer families.
23
 A previous haplotype analysis shows that two SNVs (rs4793194 and rs8176087) of the BRCA1 gene are associated with benign breast tumor, and two kinds of linkage disequilibrium (rs8176237 and rs1060915, rs1060915 and rs799912) are associated with breast malignancies.
24
 The value of the other SNVs, SNPs, or linkage disequilibrium of the BRCA genes remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential linkage disequilibrium in breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

A total of 49 breast cancer patients who received radical operation and standard adjuvant therapy from April 2006 to January 2017 at National Cheng Kung University were enrolled in this study. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of NCKUH (NCKUH IRB number A‐ER‐105‐233), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study participation. All these patients’ information, including demographics, past history, histopathologic findings, family history, and clinical results, was collected from a retrospective chart review. The tumor, node, and metastasis stage was defined according to the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer classification, 7th edition (corrected printing 2015). The patients received regular follow‐up until November 2023.

Formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded tissue specimens were collected from the Department of Pathology in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH). DNA samples were extracted from the cancer tissues. Short amplicons of DNA were generated, and specific primers for target regions were applied in the amplicon‐based target enrichment of Oncomine Cancer Research Panel version 1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). High‐fidelity DNA polymerase was used to reduce the polymerase errors and bypass uracil/abasic sites. An Ion 318 chip (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was prepared and loaded according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The sequencing data of the BRCA1/2 genes were available for analysis. The reference genome (hg19) was compared with the sequencing reads, and variants were analyzed by Torrent Suite 5.0.4 (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The minimal depth of SNVs and small insertions/deletions (indels) was 15. The minimal allele frequency (AF) was 7% for indels. Some SNV hotspots were designed in the Oncomine system, and the minimal AF was 3% for SNVs in the hotspots, whereas for SNVs not in hotspots, the minimal AF was 4%. Target sequencing data of 143 genes from the first 44 patients has been analyzed in a previous report.
25
 The sequencing of BRCA genes from all breast cancer patients was extracted for this study.

Germline whole genome sequencing was performed in six breast cancer patients within the previous cohort. These six patients agreed to redraw blood during follow‐up. Additionally, SNVs of 500 healthy Taiwanese were obtained from the Taiwan Biobank. The SNVs of the germline BRCA1/2 genes were analyzed and compared with those of breast cancer patients. Family history of breast, prostate, and lung cancers was also obtained by questionnaire. No personal history of benign breast disease or family history of other cancers was available from the Taiwan Biobank. All this information was obtained cross‐sectionally without update.

The SNVs in the BRCA genes obtained from whole genome sequencing were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The target regions were amplified using the KAPA HiFi HotStart PCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The primers used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing were designed and synthesized by Mission Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan). The primer sequence is listed in Table S1. The reactions were run in a 9700‐thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) using the following cycling parameters: 3 min holding at 95°C, followed by 25 cycles of 20 s at 95°C, 20 s at 66°C, and 30 s at 72°C, and the final hold was at 4°C. The presence of amplicons was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The PCR amplicons were using the PCR Fragment Extraction Kit (Geneaid Biotech, New Taipei City, Taiwan). DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) on the ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer.

The haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium structures were generated using Haploview 4.2 (https://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview). Block definition was performed using a confidence interval with a default threshold.
26

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 16.1 (College Station, TX). Pearson's χ2‐test was used to perform the univariate analysis of the categorical variables. Continuous variables were analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. The recurrence‐free survival (RFS) and OS were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and the log‐rank test. The level of statistical significance was set as a p < 0.5.

### RESULTS

Pairwise analyses of linkage disequilibrium in the BRCA1/2 genes from the germline data of 500 healthy individuals were performed (Figure 1). Among the nine SNPs of the BRCA1 gene (Figure 1A) selected, eight were significantly correlated with each other. Moreover, among the 13 SNPs of the BRCA2 gene selected, eight showed a linkage disequilibrium (Figure 1B). The same pairwise analyses were performed in the sequencing data from 49 breast cancer patients. Seven SNPs of the BRCA1 gene and three SNPs of the BRCA2 gene showed a linkage disequilibrium (Figure 1CD). The incidence of these seven BRCA1 SNPs in the healthy population ranged from 0.377 to 0.379 (Table S2). The incidence of these three BRCA2 SNPs in healthy people was 0.087 (Table S3).

Most breast cancer patients in our study died due to cancer recurrence. Only six patients in survivors agreed to redraw blood, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) could be obtained. The germline genotype was obtained by whole genome sequencing of PBMCs to compare with the somatic genotype of the breast cancer specimens. The targeted SNPs with a linkage disequilibrium are listed in Table 1. The AF of each SNP in the somatic genotype from breast cancer patients is similar to the germline genotype from the PBMCs of the patients. The analysis of linkage disequilibrium of the BRCA1/2 genes from the breast cancer specimens was feasible.

The AF of each SNP with a linkage disequilibrium was calculated in the germline genotype of 500 healthy controls and the somatic genotype of 49 breast cancer specimens (22 patients without recurrence and 27 patients with recurrence). The incidence of BRCA1 p.K38K and BRCA2 p.I3412V was slightly higher in breast cancer patients. The incidence of BRCA2 p.N289H was slightly lower among breast cancer patients (Figure S1). The difference in AF was small, and the AF was similar among the three groups (Table 2).

Allele frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms with linkage disequilibrium.

Logistic regression between the AF of each SNP and pathological factors was performed to obtain the p‐value. The heatmap of the p‐values is shown in Figure 2. The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was significantly correlated with positive extensive intraductal components (EIC), existing lymphatic tumor emboli (LTE), and lymph node (LN) metastasis. BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium was significantly correlated with a high histological grade and TNBC subtype and partially correlated with existing LTE, LN metastasis, and positive expression of progesterone receptor.

Heatmap and clustering of p‐values for 21 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the BRCA1/2 genes (n = 49 patients with breast cancer). The p‐values were calculated by logistic regression between the SNVs and pathological factors, including tumor size, histological grade, extensive intraductal component (EIC), lymphatic tumor emboli (LTE), lymph node (LN) metastasis, intrinsic subtype, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or grade. For the intrinsic subtype, those with hormone receptor‐positive/HER2‐negative cancer was treated as the reference group, and their data were compared with those with HER2‐enriched and tripe negative breast cancer. A p < 0.05 was defined as significant, and these values are shown in dark red.

For the present study, we used clinical information and sequencing data from 500 healthy people. These healthy controls do not have past history of any kinds of cancer. The breast cancer patients had a high incidence of other cancer during follow‐up (Table S4). The healthy people and breast cancer patients had similar risk of family history of breast cancer (Table S4). The incidence of family history of other cancers was higher in breast cancer patients (Table S4); however, incomplete information from Taiwan Biobank could have misled the interpretation about family cancer history in normal population.

Benign variants of genes are correlated with the occurrence of benign diseases.
27
 In our study, the linkage disequilibrium with seven and three benign SNPs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively, was studied in breast cancer patients. Twenty patients had wild‐type BRCA1 gene and 29 had a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium. Thirty‐nine patients had wild‐type BRCA2 and 10 had a BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium. The BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with a personal history of benign diseases or family history of cancer (Tables S5 and S6). The patients with BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium tended to have a higher incidence of other cancers (Table S6). One patient with colon cancer in the wild‐type group, and one patient with endometrioid cancer and one with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I) in the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium group were recorded. However, the number of events was small, and the result was inconclusive.

Patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer with a higher percentage of tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive EIC (Figure 3A,B). The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with other pathological factors (Figure 3 and Table 3). The BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with most pathological factors (Figure 4 and Table 4), but it had a lower incidence of grade III cancer (Figure 4D).

The median follow‐up time was 69 months for all breast cancer patients (range: 10–209 months). Ten patients with wild‐type BRCA1 and 17 patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer recurrence. Nine patients with wild‐type BRCA1 and 14 patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium died due to breast cancer (Table S7). Twenty‐two patients with wild‐type BRCA2 and five with a BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer recurrence. Twenty patients with wild‐type BRCA2 and three with a BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium died due to breast cancer (Table S8). The BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with breast cancer recurrence.

Kaplan–Meier analyses of RFS and OS of breast cancer patients was performed. Exonic mutation of BRCA1/2 genes was not correlated with RFS (Figure 5A,B). The patients with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium tended to have a worse RFS (Figure 5C), but not those with the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium (Figure 5D). The patients with BRCA1 exonic mutation tended to have a better OS (Figure 6A), but not those with BRCA2 exonic mutation (Figure 6B). The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with OS (Figure 6C). Finally, those with BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium had slightly better OS (Figure 6D).

### Significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms in breast cancer

The AF of each SNP with a linkage disequilibrium was calculated in the germline genotype of 500 healthy controls and the somatic genotype of 49 breast cancer specimens (22 patients without recurrence and 27 patients with recurrence). The incidence of BRCA1 p.K38K and BRCA2 p.I3412V was slightly higher in breast cancer patients. The incidence of BRCA2 p.N289H was slightly lower among breast cancer patients (Figure S1). The difference in AF was small, and the AF was similar among the three groups (Table 2).

### Effects of 
BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium on survival of breast cancer patients

Patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer with a higher percentage of tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive EIC (Figure 3A,B). The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with other pathological factors (Figure 3 and Table 3). The BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with most pathological factors (Figure 4 and Table 4), but it had a lower incidence of grade III cancer (Figure 4D).

The median follow‐up time was 69 months for all breast cancer patients (range: 10–209 months). Ten patients with wild‐type BRCA1 and 17 patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer recurrence. Nine patients with wild‐type BRCA1 and 14 patients with a BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium died due to breast cancer (Table S7). Twenty‐two patients with wild‐type BRCA2 and five with a BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium had breast cancer recurrence. Twenty patients with wild‐type BRCA2 and three with a BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium died due to breast cancer (Table S8). The BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with breast cancer recurrence.

Kaplan–Meier analyses of RFS and OS of breast cancer patients was performed. Exonic mutation of BRCA1/2 genes was not correlated with RFS (Figure 5A,B). The patients with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium tended to have a worse RFS (Figure 5C), but not those with the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium (Figure 5D). The patients with BRCA1 exonic mutation tended to have a better OS (Figure 6A), but not those with BRCA2 exonic mutation (Figure 6B). The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with OS (Figure 6C). Finally, those with BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium had slightly better OS (Figure 6D).

### DISCUSSION

SNVs/SNPs of the BRCA1/2 genes in breast cancer patients are well studied. Except for pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations, variants with unknown significance (VUS) or benign variants have been less well studied. In the present study, we showed that benign SNVs of the BRCA1/2 genes had a linkage disequilibrium. The germline genotypes of PBMCs from breast cancer patients are consistent with the somatic genotypes of breast cancer specimens. The combined germline genotypes from healthy controls and somatic genotypes of breast cancer patients showed a linkage disequilibrium from seven and three SNVs of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively. Breast cancer with BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with a personal history of benign diseases or a family history of cancer. Moreover, BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium is correlated with high tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive EIC cancer, whereas BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium is correlated with a lower ratio of grade III cancer. These data suggest that the BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium of benign SNPs are associated with specific pathological factors of breast cancer.

The germline genotypes of BRCA genes are well studied in breast cancer patients, especially those with familial and young‐onset cancer.

 A machine learning model is applied to predict pathogenic SNVs or VUS.
28
 In a previous study involving 155 breast cancer patients, VUS is detected in 4.8% and 14.3% of the patients with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively.
29
 Only a few studies have focused on benign SNPs of the BRCA genes. Our data found that BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium was not correlated with a personal history of benign diseases or family history of cancer. In contrast, the BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium was correlated with EIC‐positive cancer, and the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium was correlated with a relatively better OS of the patients. Our results supported the clinical significance of benign SNPs of the BRCA genes.

In previous studies, the linkage disequilibrium of BRCA1 gene is reported in several loci, including intron 8, exon 12, exon 13, rs8176237 (intron 17), rs1060915 (exon 13), and rs799912 (intron 5).

 The physical or genetic distance of SNVs in linkage disequilibrium is important, but it is not necessary. The association between loci and the magnitude of background selection is more critical.
30
 Moreover, the linkage disequilibrium from synonymous or nonsynonymous mutations, and from exonic or intronic mutations, has shown differences.
31
 Analyzing the data obtained from the 100 Genomes project, linkage disequilibrium from synonymous SNVs is found to be higher than that from nonsynonymous SNVs. Nonsynonymous SNV‐derived alleles are more frequently categorized into different haplotypes than into linkage disequilibrium.
32
 In our study, we focused on the linkage disequilibrium in one particular gene to avoid interference from AF or physical distance. The linkage disequilibrium was located in exons 10, 12, and 16 of the BRCA1 gene and exons 10 and 11 of the BRCA2 gene. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs were found. In the BRCA1 gene, three synonymous and four nonsynonymous SNPs were involved in the linkage disequilibrium. In the BRCA2 gene, two synonymous and one nonsynonymous SNPs were involved in the linkage disequilibrium. A linkage disequilibrium covering both synonymous and nonsynonymous SNVs/SNPs is possible.

Our study found that high tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive EIC cancer were correlated with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium. The patients with BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium tended to have a worse disease‐specific survival. BRCA1 is a multi‐domain protein with 23 exons, encoding 1863 amino acids, including the N‐terminal RING domain, a central region, coiled coil CC domain, and C‐terminal BRCT domain.
33
 The amino acids encoded by BRCA1 exons 11–13 contain binding domains for several proteins, a nuclear localization signal, and a serine cluster domain. The exon 11‐coading peptides bind with retinoblastoma, Rad50, Rad51, c‐Myc, and partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) to form protein complex repairing DNA break. Exons 11–13 of the BRCA1 gene are among the most common mutated regions.
33
 The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium in our study was located in exons 10 (BRCA1 p.K1183R, p.E1038G, p.P871L, p.L771L, and p.S694S), 12 (BRCA1 p.S1436S), and 16 (BRCA1 p.S1634G). Exon 10 and exon 12 are within the central region. The alteration of the central region might lead to changes in the shape of the BRCA1 protein and might reduce its ability for DNA repair.

In contrast, the lower ratio of grade III cancer was associated with the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium. Patients with the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium tended to have better OS. Function of linkage disequilibrium of BRCA2 gene is different from that of the BRCA1 genes. The BRCA2 protein comprised 3418 amino acids with multifunctional domains, including an N‐terminal domain binding to PALB2, eight BRC repeats, a DNA binding domain, three oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding folds, and a C‐terminal RAD51‐binding domain.
34
 The BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium in our study was located in exons 10 (BRCA2 p.S455S) and 11 (BRCA2 p.H743H and p.N991D). These three SNVs are close to the BRC repeats.
35
 The BRC repeats promote binding of RAD51 to the DNA breaks.
36
 The alteration of the BRC repeats might enhance its ability for DNA repair.

The major limitation of the present study was the small number of patients analyzed. We collected sequencing data from 500 healthy controls, but we only included 49 breast cancer patients. The limited number of patients reduced the study's statistical power. We only found a trend of survival, and a BRCA linkage disequilibrium was not present as a pathological biomarker or prognostic predictor. A future meta‐analysis might help to obtain more patients.

In conclusion, the linkage disequilibrium of BRCA genes was obtained by combining the germline genotypes from 500 healthy controls and somatic genotypes from 49 breast cancer patients. Seven benign SNPs of the BRCA1 gene and three SNPs of the BRCA2 gene were found. The BRCA1 linkage disequilibrium is correlated with high tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes and positive EIC cancer. In contrast, the BRCA2 linkage disequilibrium is correlated with a lower ratio of grade III cancer and a relatively better OS. Our data revealed that the BRCA1/2 linkage disequilibrium of benign SNPs is associated with specific pathological factors of breast cancer and might represent a prognostic predictor.
