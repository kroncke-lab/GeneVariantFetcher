## Clinical relevance of protein-truncating variants of germline DNA repair genes in prostate cancer

### Abstract

BackgroundInterpreting genetic variants remains a challenge in prostate cancer (PCa). Although many annotation tools are available for prioritizing causal variants, the clinical relevance of these variants is rarely studied.MethodsWe collected a cohort study that included 274 PCa patients from June 2017 to December 2020 and sequenced 19 DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in these patients and explored the clinical consequence of these different approaches. We also examined all-cause and PCa-specific survival in DDR gene mutation carriers compared to non-carriers after androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapy.ResultsWe identified 13 variants from 19 DDR genes in a total of 14 (5.1%) patients who had at least one presumed pathogenic mutation using different annotation methods. Four variants were annotated as pathogenic, 11 variants were predicted as protein-truncating variants (PTVs), four variants received proxy-deleterious (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion scores of > 30), and only one variant was identified as a pathogenic variant or as having a functional effect by all three methods. PCa patients with PTVs were significantly associated with early onset, high cancer stage, and a worse response to AR-directed treatment. However, patients carrying a proxy-deleterious variant were only associated with a higher T (tumor) stage and N (node) stage than those without such a variant, but not associated with other clinical characteristics. In patients treated with AR-directed therapy, patients with a PTV showed an increased risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06 ~ 11.56) and PCa-specific death (aHR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.87 ~ 10.77) compared to non-PTV carriers after adjustment. We were unable to examine gene-specific risks due to the small number of patients.ConclusionsPTVs may assist in guiding treatment and early screening in PCa, while population-specific data for pathogenic variants are still being amassed.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-024-13045-4.

### Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) has a strong genetic component; however, except in African-American men, family history [1, 2] alone is insufficient to guide screening or distinguish cancer predisposition genes. Due to expanded guidelines and options for targeted therapies, germline genetic testing has become central to PCa. In addition to information to guide treatment choices, genetic testing can provide patients information about personal and familial risks. It is estimated that 7%~12% of men with metastatic PCa is estimated to have inherited a germline mutation in a DNA damage response and repair (DDR) gene [3–5].

Prevalences of germline DDR gene mutations were previously reported, but only a few populations (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) were from Asia [6–8]. Those studies showed that mutations in DDR genes are ethnicity-specific, given the different PCa incidences and mortality risks between Caucasians and other populations. However, the studies reported fairly different results. Prevalences of DDR gene mutation genes were reported as 9.8% in the Chinese population, 5.8–8.8% in the Korean population and 2.9% in the Japanese population [6–9]. Most importantly, the clinical impacts of DDR gene mutations on cancer characteristics and treatment responses in Asians have not been fully elucidated. Although DDR deficiencies are considered to have poor responses to androgen therapy and are associated with a worse prognosis [10], results [10] are still not conclusive and few data are available from Asia.

Interpreting genetic variants remains a massive challenge despite the widespread implementation of next-generation genome sequencing, which has accelerated the discovery of rare genetic variants. Most laboratories use the five-tier guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) for interpreting sequencing variants. New emerging evidence of genetic variants resulting in variant reclassification has had profound clinical consequences, especially in the classification of likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants. However, minority populations have long been underrepresented in cancer sequencing and functional studies [11]. Therefore, minority groups are more likely than white populations to be classified as having variants with uncertain significance (VUS) due to lack of sufficient evidential weight [12, 13]. Minority groups also show higher rates of variant reclassifications than whites.

In addition to adopting ACMP/AMP guidelines for variant interpretation, many variant annotations and scoring tools are available to prioritize causal variants in genetic analyses [14, 15]. These approaches predict whether genetic variants will have effects on gene functions based on genetic features such as short inserts or deletions or shortened coding sequences. Although accurately predicting functional effects of genetic variations is critical for clinical genome interpretation, the clinical relevance of these variants is rarely studied. It is particularly worth examining whether these predicted variants are associated with clinical features in minority populations and the potential of applying these tools to assist genetic variant interpretation.

To decipher the predominant role of DDR genes in disease susceptibility and prognosis, we conducted a prospective cohort study in an Asian population to assess the clinical impacts of germline mutations of 19 commonly reported DDR genes in patients with PCa. We compared results from different variant annotation tools and explored the clinical consequences of these different approaches. Understanding the roles and contributions of germline DDR gene mutations in PCa will provide the rationale to personalize risk-reduction strategies for targeted therapy, patient prognostication, and biomarker-driven patient management. It may also provide evidence for PCa screening strategies.

### Methods

In total, 274 patients with incident or prevalent PCa seen in urology clinics at Tungs’ Taichung Metro Harbor Hospital and Taichung Veterans General Hospital from June 2017 to December 2019 were recruited. Patients were excluded if they have a personal history of tumors other than PCa. This study was approved by the internal review board of three hospitals (IRB no. 106040 for Tungs’ Taichung Metro Harbor Hospital, SF17021A for Taichung Veterans General Hospital, and N201905061 for Taipei Medical University). All patients provided written informed consent. Data were deidentified, except for study investigators.

Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records including patients’ age at cancer diagnosis and cancer characteristics. Patients were divided into the following age groups: ≤55, 55 ~ 64, 65 ~ 74, and ≥ 75 years at the time of diagnosis. The clinical stage was categorized by the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) stage using the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification system [16]. Cancer grade was based on the Gleason score (GS), and it was grouped into scores of 2 ~ 6, 7, and 8 ~ 10. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level detected at diagnosis was included. We adopted the risk group stratification of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [17], which considers the clinical stage T, the level of PSA level, and the biopsy GS [17]. In this prevalent cohort, a portion of the patients developed castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) during recruitment. We identified those who received androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapy (abiraterone or enzalutamide). All patients were followed up until December 2019, and their vital status was determined from the Taiwan Death Registry.

Genomic DNAs were extracted from 274 peripheral blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES). The WES library used the SureSelect All Exon V7 kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 150 pair-end reads were sequenced by the HiSeq 4000 sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average read depth of > 100×. The averaged percent of target coverage > 50X is 79.2%.

### Sequencing of germline DNA

Genomic DNAs were extracted from 274 peripheral blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for subsequent whole exome sequencing (WES). The WES library used the SureSelect All Exon V7 kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 150 pair-end reads were sequenced by the HiSeq 4000 sequencing machine (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with an average read depth of > 100×. The averaged percent of target coverage > 50X is 79.2%.

### Bioinformatics analysis

FASTQ files from WES were trimmed to remove adapters sequence and low-quality reads. Reads were aligned to the human hg38 reference genome. We performed standard procedures in DRAGEN 3.8.4 (Illumina) through Basespace, a cloud-based informatics platform. The variant calling of 20 genes were extracted based on Pritchard’s study [3]. The gene RAD51D was excluded because only two variants were detected. One is annotated as benign and another is likely benign by Clinvar. Most of which are established DNA-repair genes: ATM, ATR, BAP1, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, GEN1, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, RAD51D, and XRCC2. Variants filtered with minimum coverage of 10 reads, call quality > 20.0 were kept.

Analytical software, ANNOVAR, was used for variant annotation [18]. A variant annotation is shown in Fig. 1A. Variants with an allelic frequency of < 5% or that were recorded as benign or likely benign in the ClinVar database were excluded [19]. Allelic frequencies of variants were derived from dbSNP [20] and whole-genome sequences were from the Taiwan Biobank Project [21]. The pathogenicity of variants (indels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) was identified using ACMG/AMP guidelines according the annotations of the InterVar and ClinVar databases [19, 22, 23]. Protein-truncated variants (PTVs) were identified as frameshift, stop-gain, or splicing site events based on MANE selected transcripts [24]. Deleterious variants were prioritized by Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) [25]. Variants with a Phred-like CADD score of > 30 were evaluated as proxy-deleterious.

Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented using a descriptive analysis. To investigate associations of pathogenic variants with demographic and clinical characteristics, we used Cochran-Armitage one-sided tests for discrete variables. All statistics were two-sided, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cox models were used to compare PCa-specific survival of men who carried pathogenic mutations and those who did not. We adjusted these models for the confounding effects of age at onset, type of new-generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and risk group at diagnosis. The Fine and Gray method was adapted to estimate the hazard of PCa-specific survival considering competing risks from other causes of death [26]. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimating the risk of death associated with patients who carried pathogenic mutations compared to those without such mutations were calculated.

### Variant annotation

Analytical software, ANNOVAR, was used for variant annotation [18]. A variant annotation is shown in Fig. 1A. Variants with an allelic frequency of < 5% or that were recorded as benign or likely benign in the ClinVar database were excluded [19]. Allelic frequencies of variants were derived from dbSNP [20] and whole-genome sequences were from the Taiwan Biobank Project [21].

### Results

We identified 13 variants in 19 DDR genes by different annotation methods in a total of 14 (5.1%) patients who had at least one presumed pathogenic mutation (Table 1). Four variants were annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar or InterVar, 11 variants were predicted to be PTVs, four variants were judged to be proxy-deleterious (with CADD scores of > 30), and only one variant was identified as being a pathogenic variant or having a functional effect by all three methods (Fig. 1B). For the 13 variants, only two missense variants were identified in the proxy-deleterious category. We also identified two BRCA2 mutations, five ATM mutations, and three variants in mismatch repair genes: MSH2 (n = 2) and MLH1. We also identified other variants in CHEK2, BARD1, and XRCC2. Among these variants, four were novel variants that were not registered in dbSNP, and eight variants were recorded in ClinVar. Among these previously reported variants, three were reported to be pathogenic/pathogenic-like. Four of five variants were annotated as having evidence of hereditary cancer-associated conditions. However, these variants were classified as having uncertain significance (VUS) or conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (CIs). Only rs1205233530 was submitted as a VUS through the condition of ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome.

We examined associations of proxy-deleterious variants and PTVs with clinical characteristics at cancer diagnosis (Table 2). Patients who carried a DDR gene mutation annotated by both methods were significantly associated with a higher T stage at cancer diagnosis (proxy-deleterious variants: p = 0.00296; PTVs: p = 0.0058) and were more likely to have cancer spread to lymph nodes (proxy-deleterious variants: p = 0.0396; PTVs: p = 0.0293). Compared to no patients ≥ 75 years old who carried a DDR gene mutation interpreted as PTVs, 8.3% of patients aged < 55 years, 5.8% of those aged 55 ~ 64 years, and 2.4% of those aged 65 ~ 74 years old carried DDR PTVs (p = 0.0111). Patients with DDR PTVs were more likely to be diagnosed with regional or metastatic diseases than those without them (p = 0.0397). In addition, these patients were more likely to have been diagnosed with early-onset PCa or with advanced-stage cancer compared to non-carriers (7.7% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.0016). However, these associations were not observed in proxy-deleterious variants. The distribution of PTVs by age at onset, disease stage, or both conditions is presented in Fig. 2.

In our cohort, 111 patients developed castration-resistant metastases and received AR-directed therapy. We present results from genetic variants prioritized as proxy-deleterious or predicted to be PTVs. Proxy-deleterious variants did not show a significant association with overall or cancer-specific survival. However, genetic variants predicted as PTVs were significantly associated with both outcomes. Among these patients, four men (3.6%) carried a germline DDR PTV, including BRCA2 (n = 2), BARD1 and XRCC2. The median follow-up time was 1.97 years. Patients with a PTV were associated with an increased risk of all-cause death (aHR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.06 ~ 11.56) compared to non-PTV carriers after treatment (Table 3) in Cox models after adjusting for the age at onset, the type of AR-directed therapy, and the risk group at baseline. They were also associated with an increased risk of PCa-specific death (aHR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.87 ~ 10.77) compared to carriers in the Fine and Gray model. We also examine the impact of DDR mutations on survival in all patients and included the results in the supplement table.

### Germline DDR gene mutations

We identified 13 variants in 19 DDR genes by different annotation methods in a total of 14 (5.1%) patients who had at least one presumed pathogenic mutation (Table 1). Four variants were annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar or InterVar, 11 variants were predicted to be PTVs, four variants were judged to be proxy-deleterious (with CADD scores of > 30), and only one variant was identified as being a pathogenic variant or having a functional effect by all three methods (Fig. 1B). For the 13 variants, only two missense variants were identified in the proxy-deleterious category. We also identified two BRCA2 mutations, five ATM mutations, and three variants in mismatch repair genes: MSH2 (n = 2) and MLH1. We also identified other variants in CHEK2, BARD1, and XRCC2. Among these variants, four were novel variants that were not registered in dbSNP, and eight variants were recorded in ClinVar. Among these previously reported variants, three were reported to be pathogenic/pathogenic-like. Four of five variants were annotated as having evidence of hereditary cancer-associated conditions. However, these variants were classified as having uncertain significance (VUS) or conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (CIs). Only rs1205233530 was submitted as a VUS through the condition of ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with DDR gene mutations

We examined associations of proxy-deleterious variants and PTVs with clinical characteristics at cancer diagnosis (Table 2). Patients who carried a DDR gene mutation annotated by both methods were significantly associated with a higher T stage at cancer diagnosis (proxy-deleterious variants: p = 0.00296; PTVs: p = 0.0058) and were more likely to have cancer spread to lymph nodes (proxy-deleterious variants: p = 0.0396; PTVs: p = 0.0293). Compared to no patients ≥ 75 years old who carried a DDR gene mutation interpreted as PTVs, 8.3% of patients aged < 55 years, 5.8% of those aged 55 ~ 64 years, and 2.4% of those aged 65 ~ 74 years old carried DDR PTVs (p = 0.0111). Patients with DDR PTVs were more likely to be diagnosed with regional or metastatic diseases than those without them (p = 0.0397). In addition, these patients were more likely to have been diagnosed with early-onset PCa or with advanced-stage cancer compared to non-carriers (7.7% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.0016). However, these associations were not observed in proxy-deleterious variants. The distribution of PTVs by age at onset, disease stage, or both conditions is presented in Fig. 2.

### DDR gene mutations and AR-directed therapy

In our cohort, 111 patients developed castration-resistant metastases and received AR-directed therapy. We present results from genetic variants prioritized as proxy-deleterious or predicted to be PTVs. Proxy-deleterious variants did not show a significant association with overall or cancer-specific survival. However, genetic variants predicted as PTVs were significantly associated with both outcomes. Among these patients, four men (3.6%) carried a germline DDR PTV, including BRCA2 (n = 2), BARD1 and XRCC2. The median follow-up time was 1.97 years. Patients with a PTV were associated with an increased risk of all-cause death (aHR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.06 ~ 11.56) compared to non-PTV carriers after treatment (Table 3) in Cox models after adjusting for the age at onset, the type of AR-directed therapy, and the risk group at baseline. They were also associated with an increased risk of PCa-specific death (aHR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.87 ~ 10.77) compared to carriers in the Fine and Gray model. We also examine the impact of DDR mutations on survival in all patients and included the results in the supplement table.

### Discussion

Our study compared the clinical relevance of genetic variants annotated by ACMG/AMP guidelines and predicted PTVs and proxy-deleterious variants in a minority population. We found that 4.4% of PCa patients in Taiwan carried a PTV, and patients with these variants were significantly associated with early-onset, a high clinical stage, and a worse response to AR-directed treatment. However, two proxy-deleterious missense variants found in the in silico analysis were associated with high T and N stages only, but not with other clinical parameters. Our results suggest that PTVs can potentially have a higher clinical function than CADD scores in Asian cohorts and therefore deserve further evaluation.

We found a much lower mutation rate compared to the prevalence of 9.8% mutation in a Chinese population that focused on a similar gene list and similar criteria [5]. However, pathogenic variants found in our cohort demonstrated a significantly high clinical impact on PCa of early onset and a high cancer stage, which was not shown in their data. On the other hand, the mutation rate in our cohort was higher than that in a Japanese population (2.9%) [6], which was only based on ACMG/AMP criteria. Different implementation of each condition in the ACMG/AMP criteria, especially the condition of PVS1 may help explain the diverse results.

Pathogenic variants in the BRCA2 gene were the most frequent mutations reported in Chinese and Japanese populations and also in a multi-ethic study [4, 6]. However, ATM mutations were the most frequent mutations in our population, accounting for 38% (5/13) of the variants. Recent study showed both BRCA2 and ATM mutations are associated with lethal or early on-set prostate cancer, although with a limited number of Chinese populations [27]. Our result supported the conclusion, demonstrating that patients with BRCA2 and ATM mutation were associated with early onset and advanced diseases. However, mutation prevalence and also mutation frequency of the BRCA2 and ATM may be influenced by the composition of patients, which could be affected by differing PSA screening approaches in various countries. Larger studies are obviously needed to confirm these findings and provide a conclusion.

ATMs are known as a protein kinase of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family and are implicated in cellular stress responses and the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) [28]. Within the five ATM variants we identified, two were reported to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic in the ClinVar database, while the others were newly discovered. Although olaparib is offered to patients with metastatic (m)CRPC who harbor germline or somatic mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 [29] as well as ATMs, studies suggested that the ATM protein primarily functions as a sensor of DNA damage rather than as a mediator of DNA repair such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 [30]. Therefore, men who carry ATM mutations do not respond to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as well as men with BRCA1/2 mutations [31]. The response to PARP inhibitors in metastatic PCa in Asian men is worth investigating to optimize treatment strategies in this population.

Several studies documented treatment responses of men with DDR gene mutations after AR-targeted therapy [32–36]. However, conflicting results were reported from these studies. This is the first study to show the impact of DDR mutations on PC-specific survival in an Asian population. Although the prevalence of DDR gene mutations was low in our cohort, we discovered a strong influence (4.49-times) of these mutations on mortality. Most importantly, our results suggested that rare mutations in other DDR genes contributed to the biological behavior of PCa in Asian patients, while previous studies focused primarily on the impact of ATM or BRCA1/2 mutations on mortality.

NCCN guidelines recommend germline testing for men with metastatic or high-risk PCa to determine the eligibility of patients for PARP inhibitors [37]. Another set of NCCN guidelines, Prostate Cancer Early Detection, also recommends early detection at the age of 40 years for BRCA2 carriers [38]. However, there are no screening or testing recommendations for individuals with germline gene mutations of BRCA1, ATM, or mismatch repair [38]. Our results suggested that PTVs may play a role in the early detection of PCa due to their association with early-onset or advanced PCa.

Despite the low prevalence of the DDR genes found, we successfully discovered a list of high-penetrance germline mutations with clinical implications. We identified 11 pathogenic variants that cause protein truncation by frameshift or stop gain. The PTVs cause loss of function in the DNA-repair mechanism and are expected to be of high penetration in cancers. However, there are some limitations that need to be addressed. First, our study was limited by the number of patients when examining gene-specific risks to have more-stable estimates. A large population is needed to confirm these variants. Second, we were unable to find the clinical relevance of missense variants in our population. More functional studies are needed to understand the contributions of missense variants to germline mutations. In addition, other genetic mutations, such as large deletions, insertions, and other complex structural rearrangements, could not be determined in this study. We also did not have somatic mutations of biopsies to evaluate second mutations for variant carriers as a consequence of the inactivation of DNA repair genes. Finally, this is a relatively small study which limited its generalizability to other populations.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated the current challenge in annotating genetic variants and limitations of ACMG/AMP guidelines especially in minority populations. The clinical relevance of variants predicted PTVs and annotated by CADD suggested another approach to interpret variants. This study addressed previously reported in Japanese and Chinese populations and emphasized the importance and unmet need for ethnic-specific data.
