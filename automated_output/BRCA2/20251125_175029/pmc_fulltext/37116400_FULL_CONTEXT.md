## Relationship between homologous recombination deficiency and clinical features of breast cancer based on genomic scar score☆

### Abstract

BackgroundHomologous recombination deficiency (HRD) phenotype will sensitize tumors to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases inhibitors and platinum. However, previous studies did not focus on the prevalence of HRD among Chinese breast cancer (BC) patients.MethodsOne hundred and forty-seven BC patients were included in this study. Their HRD status was assessed by Genomic Scar Score (GSS), which was determined according to the length, site, and type of copy number. HRD was defined as positive when a harmful BRCA1/2 mutation was detected or GSS ≥50.ResultsOur data revealed that 9.5% of the 147 patients tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutation, while approximately 34.7% were HRD-positive. For triple negative BC (TNBC), HRD positivity rate (60.5%) was higher than Luminal A (5.3%), Luminal B (HER2-) (28.8%), and Luminal B (HER2+) (31.6%) subgroups. HRD-positive tumors were more likely to be ER/PR-negative and exhibited higher Ki-67 expression. 50.0% of the HRD-positive patients achieved pathologic complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy. HRD-positive patients tended to have a higher risk for cancer recurrence or metastasis compared to HRD-negative patients (29.4% vs. 13.5%).ConclusionWe investigated the HRD status among Chinese BC patients using an HRD detection tool developed based on the Chinese population. The clinical characteristics, pathological profile, family history pattern, neoadjuvant efficacy, and disease progression events of HRD-positive and negative patients were described and compared. Thus, our data provided an evidence-based basis for applying the original HRD assay in Chinese BC.

### Introduction

Female breast cancer (BC) has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.7% of total cases) worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death in women [1]. In China, breast cancer also ranked first, accounting for 16.7% (306,000) of all new cancer cases in women, and contributed to the most cancer deaths in the younger group (age 15–44 years) [2]. Thus, breast cancer has posed a significant threat to women's health and a considerable disease burden to developing countries, including China. Although globally standardized treatment regimens are accessible, personalized medication targeting individual genetic defects or mutations is considered more effective and promising to improve patients' prognosis. Genomic instability is one of the most critical factors that drive oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis, and DNA repair deficiency has been described as a hallmark of cancers [3]. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) is a critical DNA repair pathway by which DNA damage, mainly DNA double-strand breaks and interstrand cross-links, can be corrected using the sister chromatid as a template for repair [4]. Additionally, HRR pathways support the recovery of stalled replication forks during DNA replication [5]. Deficiency of the HRR mechanism is termed homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), which has been proven to correlate with carcinogenesis and progression of multiple tumor types. Successful HRR depends on a series of functioning proteins, among which BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most studied and considered to play critical roles [6]. Any germline or somatic mutations and epigenetic modifications of BRCA1 and BRCA2 could result in an HRD phenotype in cancer, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. Other genes involved in the HRR pathway, such as ATM, PALB2, and RAD51, have also been determined to define an HRD phenotype, though less consistent than BRCA1/2 among various cancers [7]. Thus studies investigating the role of these genes in HRD phenotype between different cancer types are undergoing recently.

Based on previous data, HRD was most prevalent in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer (85% combined) and only occurred sporadically in other cancer types (15%) [7]. As for BC prevalence of germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 7.8% and 5.7%, while the prevalence of somatic mutations in BRCAl and BRCA2 was 3.4% and 2.7%, respectively. Compared to other molecular subtypes of BC, triple negative BC (TNBC) had significantly higher rates of BRCA1 mutations(14.4%) and BRCA2 mutations (3.9%) [8]. The risk of contralateral breast cancer was substantially higher in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [9]. Therefore, the value of BRCA1/2 mutation testing in BC patients is receiving more attention, and the proportion of genetic screening for BRCA1/2 mutation in BC patients, especially those with a high risk of recurrence, is rapidly increasing in clinical practice.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase proteins (PARPs) are nuclear enzymes that participate in the base excision repair process of single-strand DNA repair [10]. PARPs act on sites of single-strand DNA breaks [11]. Once bound to DNA, PARP1 transfers a poly(ADP-ribose) group to itself using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in a process called “PARylation” [12]. This PARylation activity helps recruit many DNA damage repair effectors, effectively repairing single-stranded DNA breaks. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) could induce dysfunctional DNA single-strand break repair, converting single-stranded breaks to double-stranded breaks during replication [13]. In cells with BRCA1/2 mutations that cannot repair double-stranded breaks through HRR pathway, the adoption of PARPis leads to synthetic lethality of the cell [14]. PARPis were first approved for ovarian cancer [15]. Subsequently, clinical trials, such as OlympiAD and OlympiA, confirmed that PARPis significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in BC with BRCA1/2 mutations. Therefore, the FDA approved PARPis for BC patients with BRCA1/2 mutation [16,17]. However, As mentioned above, besides BRCA1/2 mutations, abnormalities of other non-BRCA genes in the HRR pathway also lead to an HRD phenotype (traits which are collectively referred to as “BRCAness”) [18]. Notably, 50%–60% of TNBC patients are speculated to present as “BRCAness” [19]. Recently, with the advancement of HRD research, HRD-positive patients, including those without BRCA mutations, have benefited from PARPis. The SWOG S1416 study showed improved PFS in the cisplatin plus veliparib group compared to the cisplatin plus placebo treated group in the BRCA-like (BRCA mutation-negative but HRD-positive) population (median PFS of 5.7 months vs. 4.3 months) [20]. GeparSixto indicated that with or without carboplatin, HRD-positive patients were more likely to reach pCR than patients with HR nondeficient tumors [21]. Therefore, accurate screening for patients carrying HRD should be seriously considered beyond mere detection of BRCA1/2 mutation.

Until now, there has been no consensus on the gene set that defines HRD and no systematic evaluation of the different methods to determine HRD [22]. However, popular clinical sequencing assays for HRD consist of four categories: HRR-related gene mutation assays [23], genomic scar analysis [24], mutational signatures [25], and HRD functional assays [26]. Two commercial genomic scar assays have been developed, namely the “myChoice HRD test” from Myriad Genetics and the “FoundationOne CDx” assay from Foundation Medicine. The “myChoice HRD test” integrates the loss of heterozygosity (LOH), the number of telomeric allelic imbalances (TAI), and the large-scale state transitions (LST) to evaluate a combined HRD score named Genomic Instability Score (GIS). HRD-positive status is defined as Genomic Instability Score≥42 and/or pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 [27]. The “FoundationOne CDx” assay evaluates the proportion of LOH fragments in the entire genome. HRD-positive status is defined as patients with tumor tissue BRCA positivity and/or LOH ≥16% [28]. Presently, no HRD test kits evaluating genomic scars based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) have been approved for BC. The myChoice HRD test is mainly based on genetic data from the Caucasian population [29], and more clinical data is yet required to determine its reliability among Chinese. The FoundationOne CDx was continuously adjusted according to clinical trials, such as platinum REAL2, ARIEL2, and ARIEL3 for rucaparib. By now, ≥16% has been determined as the threshold of the LOH score [30]. However, the applicability of HRD cut-off scores in Chinese populations is still unknown and should be determined based on the association between genomic damage and molecular variants in HRR-associated genes. Therefore, the development and clinical verification of these kits should be promoted urgently.

In this study, we revealed the HRD status of Chinese BC patients based on genetic scar scores. We explored the relationship between HRD status and clinical characteristics. In addition, our data provided an evidence-based basis for predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese BC patients who are negative for BRCA 1/2 mutation but positive for HRD status.

### Materials and methods

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (The approval number: 2022076). One hundred forty-seven patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University were recruited for this study. All patients signed informed consent. Clinical and pathological information, including age, menstrual history, medical history, family history, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluation of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67, was obtained from medical records and pathology reports (Fig. 1). IHC evaluations were performed in a blinded and independent way by two qualified pathologists. A joint re-assessment would be made for the final consensus. According to The 13th St Gallen International Expert Consensus, the cutoffs for ER and PR were 1% [31]. HER2 status was first determined by IHC. 0 or 1+ was considered HER2 negative, and 3+ was considered positive. In samples showing IHC 2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification was applied, as described in a previous study [32].Fig. 1Flow chart of this study.Fig. 1

The formalin fixation and paraffin embedding tumor samples were obtained from a core-needle biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy or from surgically removed tumors of untreated patients. Using HANDLE technology (Halo-shape ANnealing and Defer-Ligation Enrichment System), a modified Molecular Inversion Probe, to construct an amplicon-based DNA library. The tumor cell content for the HRD detection was not less than 30%. HRD Complete panel (Amoydx Ltd., Xiamen, China), covering 1.5 MB of human genomic regions, and including all exons of BRCA1/2 and 24,000 (24 k) target SNPs distributed across the complete human genome [33]. Sequencing was performed by NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, Inc).

According to physical or biological properties, each chromosomal copy number (CNV) was divided into three categories, including length of copy number (LCN), site of copy number (SCN), and type of copy number (TCN). LCN consisted of three groups: large (>15 Mb), middle (10–15 Mb), and small (<5 Mb); SCN included telomere, centromere, and other repetitive sequences; TCN consisted of LOH, allele-specific CNV, and allele-balance CNV. These three independent categories of variables were combined to form an entity description for chromosomal copy number. The weight of each entity description item was trained from patients with gBRCA 1/2 deficient and patients with the quiescent genome. Finally, through support vector machine (SVM) training, the weights of entity description items were summed to obtain the Genomic Scar Score (GSS). GSS ≥50 was considered positive for HRD [33].

According to a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and College of American Pathologists [34], HRR pathway genes, including ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L, were classified into a 4-tiered system: tier I, variants of vital clinical significance; tier II, variants of potential clinical significance; tier III, variants of unknown significance; and tier IV, variants deemed benign or likely benign. The HRR-positive mutation was defined as tier I or II (Supplementary Table 1). HRD-positive was defined by BRCA1/2 mutation-positive or GSS ≥50. If the BRCA1/2 mutation was positive, germline verification was performed using the patient's blood sample.

Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical software 4.1.2. The chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to identify differences between HRD status and clinical characteristics. A two-sided P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Results

Of the 147 patients, 4.1% (6/147) were BRCA1 mutation-positive, including 83.3% (5/6) germline mutations and 16.7% (1/6) somatic mutations. Regarding mutation type, frameshift accounted for 66.7% (4/6) and missense for 33.3% (2/6). 5.4% (8/147) of the patients were BRCA2 mutation-positive (Fig. 2A), including 87.5% (7/8) frameshift mutations and 12.5% (1/8) missense mutations. All patients with BRCA2 mutations were germline mutations (Table 1). According to their BRCA1/2 mutation and GSS, We tested the GSS of all patients and divided them into four subgroups, including (1) BRCA1/2+ & GSS≥50; (2) BRCA1/2- & GSS≥50; (3) BRCA1/2+ & GSS＜50; and (4) BRCA1/2- & GSS＜50 (Table 2). According to the definition of HRD, groups (1), (2) and (3) were defined as HRD positive. Approximately 34.7% (51/147) of patients were HRD-positive. Up to 25.2% (37/147) of patients were tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutation but HRD-positive. The HRR mutation rate was 12.9% (19/147), including 84.2% (16/19) HRD-positive and 15.8% (3/19) HRD-negative (Fig. 2B). The mutation rates of ATM, BRAD1, CHEK2, FANCL, and PLAB2 were all 0.7% (1/147). No HRR-positive mutations were detected in BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L. No remaining HRR-positive mutations were found in patients (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 2). The rate of TP53 mutations was higher (62.7%) in HRD-positive patients (62.7% vs. 25.0%, P = 7.27*10^-6<0.05) (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positivity distribution in breast cancer (BC) patients.

The median age of 147 patients was 47.5 (range 17–76) (Table 3). One hundred forty-two were invasive carcinomas, and five were carcinomas in situ. The invasive carcinomas were further classified into five molecular subtypes according to the expression of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67, which were Luminal A (13.4%, 19/142), Luminal B (HER2-) (41.5%, 59/142), Luminal B (HER2+) (13.4%, 19/142), HER2+ (4.9%, 7/142), and TNBC (26.8%, 38/142) (Fig. 3A). Among patients with TNBC, the HRD positivity rate was 60.5% (23/38), and the BRCA mutation positivity rate was 18.4% (7/38). Moreover, 42.1% (16/38) of patients with TNBC were HRD-positive but tested negative for BRCA mutation (Table 3). In the other four subtypes, 26.0% (27/104) of patients tested for HRD-positive, which was much lower than that of patients with TNBC (26.0% VS 60.5% P = 1.35*10−4<0.05) (Table 3).Table 3Clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with HRD status.Table 3CharacteristicsNumber of patients (%)HRD-HRD+P valueOverallBRCA+BRCA-N14796 (65.3%)51 (34.7%)14 (9.5%)37 (25.2%)Age, n (%)0.210＜3522 (15%)18 (81.8%)4 (18.2%)2 (9.1%)2 (9.1%)35–5591 (61.9%)57 (62.6%)34 (37.4%)8 (8.8%)26 (28.6%)＞5534 (23.1%)21 (61.8%)13 (38.2%)4 (11.8%)9 (26.5%)Family history, n (%)0.121No82 (55.8%)58 (70.7%)24 (29.3%)3 (3.7%)21 (25.6%)Yes65 (44.2%)38 (58.5%)27 (41.5%)11 (16.9%)16 (24.6%)Family history of four cancer, n (%)0.085No123 (83.7%)84 (68.3%)39 (31.7%)7 (5.7%)32 (26%)Yes24 (16.3%)12 (50%)12 (50%)7 (29.2%)5 (20.8%)Menopause, n (%)0.858No85 (57.8%)55 (64.7%)30 (35.3%)8 (9.4%)22 (25.9%)Yes62 (42.2%)41 (66.1%)21 (33.9%)6 (9.7%)15 (24.2%)Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, n (%)0.942No109 (74.1%)71 (65.1%)38 (34.9%)12 (11%)26 (23.9%)Yes38 (25.9%)25 (65.8%)13 (34.2%)2 (5.3%)11 (28.9%)Side, n (%)0.588Left88 (59.9%)59 (67%)29 (33%)7 (8%)22 (25%)Right59 (40.1%)37 (62.7%)22 (37.3%)7 (11.9%)15 (25.4%)ER, n (%)<0.001(+)102 (69.4%)77 (75.5%)25 (24.5%)7 (6.9%)18 (17.6%)(−)45 (30.6%)19 (42.2%)26 (57.8%)7 (15.6%)19 (42.2%)PR, n (%)<0.001(+)91 (61.9%)69 (75.8%)22 (24.2%)6 (6.6%)16 (17.6%)(−)56 (38.1%)27 (48.2%)29 (51.8%)8 (14.3%)21 (37.5%)HER2, n (%)0.822(+)27 (18.6%)17 (63%)10 (37%)1 (3.7%)9 (33.3%)(−)118 (81.4%)77 (65.3%)41 (34.7%)13 (11%)28 (23.7%)KI67, n (%)<0.001low40 (27.2%)36 (90%)4 (10%)2 (5%)2 (5%)high107 (72.8%)60 (56.1%)47 (43.9%)12 (11.2%)35 (32.7%)Subtypes, n (%)<0.001Luminal A19 (13.4%)18 (94.7%)1 (5.3%)1 (5.3%)0 (0%)Luminall B (HER2-)59 (41.5%)42 (71.2%)17 (28.8%)5 (8.5%)12 (20.3%)Luminal B(HER2+)19 (13.4%)13 (68.4%)6 (31.6%)1 (5.3%)5 (26.3%)HER2+7 (4.9%)4 (57.1%)3 (42.9%)0 (0%)3 (42.9%)TNBC38 (26.8%)15 (39.5%)23 (60.5%)7 (18.4%)16 (42.1%)T stage, n (%)0.842Tis5 (3.4%)4 (80%)1 (20%)0 (0%)1 (20%)T1 (≤2 cm)80 (54.4%)54 (67.5%)26 (32.5%)6 (7.5%)20 (25%)T2 (＞2 cm, ＜5 cm)51 (34.7%)32 (62.7%)19 (37.3%)6 (11.8%)13 (25.5%)T3 (≥5 cm)7 (4.8%)4 (57.1%)3 (42.9%)1 (14.3%)2 (28.6%)T44 (2.7%)2 (50%)2 (50%)1 (25%)1 (25%)N stage, n (%)0.163N076 (51.7%)46 (60.5%)30 (39.5%)9 (11.8%)21 (27.6%)N151 (34.7%)36 (70.6%)15 (29.4%)4 (7.8%)11 (21.6%)N210 (6.8%)5 (50%)5 (50%)0 (0%)5 (50%)N310 (6.8%)9 (90%)1 (10%)1 (10%)0 (0%)Progression, n (%)0.020No119 (81%)83 (69.7%)36 (30.3%)8 (6.7%)28 (23.5%)Yes28 (19%)13 (46.4%)15 (53.6%)6 (21.4%)9 (32.1%)Fig. 3Relationship between genomic scar score (GSS) and subtypes of BC.

We determined the GSS for each patient as described previously. GSS-high tumors were more likely to be ER/PR-negative (P < 0.001) and exhibited significantly higher Ki-67 expression (P < 0.001) than HRD-negative tumors (Fig. 3B). Subtype analysis revealed that patients with TNBC exhibited higher GSS than Luminal A (P = 2.398 × 10−7 <0.05), Luminal B (HER2-) (P = 1.294 × 10−6 <0.05), and Luminal B (HER2+) (P = 0.004 < 0.05). Luminal B (HER2-) (P = 0.001 < 0.05) and Luminal B (HER2+) (P = 0.001 < 0.05) showed higher GSS than luminal A. Significant differences were not detected in HER2+ compared to other subtypes (Fig. 3C). Moreover, HRD positivity was higher in TNBC (60.5%, 23/38) than in Luminal A (5.3%, 1/19, P = 6.79 × 10−5<0.05), Luminal B (HER2-) (28.8%, 17/59, P = 0.002 < 0.05) and Luminal B (HER2+) (31.6%, 6/19, P = 0.039 < 0.05). HRD positivity was not significantly different among Luminal A, Luminal B (HER2-), Luminal B (HER2+), and HER2+ subtypes (Fig. 3D).

All patients were interviewed to determine their family history of cancer (Supplementary Table 3). 44.2% (65/147) of the patients had a family history of any cancer reviewed. Only 16.3% (24/147) of patients had a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer. Among patients with a family history, 41.5% (27/65) were HRD-positive. Among patients without a family history, the HRD positivity rate was 29.3% (24/82). However, the difference was not significant (41.5% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.120). We further analyzed the detailed profile of family history in both groups. In the HRD-positive group, the top 4 cancers were: breast cancer (13.7%), lung cancer (13.7%), esophageal cancer (7.8%), and ovarian cancer (3.9%) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Comparison of the distribution of family history among HRD-positive and negative patients.Fig. 4

Thirty-eight patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Fig. 5A). Excluding two patients who had not yet get the operation, 12 were HRD-positive, and 24 were HRD-negative. 50.0% (6/12) of HRD-positive patients achieved pCR, whereas only 8.3% (2/24) of HRD-negative patients achieved pCR (P = 0.009 < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Eleven patients received platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Excluding one patient who had not yet underwent the operation, 60.0% (3/5) of HRD-positive patients achieved pCR, while none of HRD-negative patients achieved pCR.Fig. 5Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for BC.

We recorded the iDFS events of all patients. At the time of last follow-up, invasive diseases occurred in 29.4% (15/51) of the HRD-positive patients (Fig. 6A). Recorded invasive diseases included contralateral breast cancer (20.0%), ipsilateral recurrences (26.7%), distant metastasis (33.3%), and second primary cancer (SPC) (20.0%). Distant metastases were mainly located in bone (13.3%), followed by contralateral supraclavicular lymph nodes (6.7%), ovary (6.7%), and liver (6.7%). SPC included gastric cancer (6.7%), pancreatic cancer (6.7%), and ovarian cancer (6.7%) (Fig. 6B). In the HRD-negative patients, disease progression occurred in only 13.5% (13/96) of patients (Fig. 6A), mostly were distant metastases (77.0%), followed by recurrence (15.3%) and SPC (7.7%). Distant metastases were predominantly occurred in the lung (46.2%), followed by bone (23.1%), and only 7.7% in the liver (Fig. 6B). HRD-positive patients were more susceptible to disease progression than the HRD-negative ones (29.4% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.02 < 0.05).Fig. 6Disease progression in BC patients.

### HRD status based on GSS

Of the 147 patients, 4.1% (6/147) were BRCA1 mutation-positive, including 83.3% (5/6) germline mutations and 16.7% (1/6) somatic mutations. Regarding mutation type, frameshift accounted for 66.7% (4/6) and missense for 33.3% (2/6). 5.4% (8/147) of the patients were BRCA2 mutation-positive (Fig. 2A), including 87.5% (7/8) frameshift mutations and 12.5% (1/8) missense mutations. All patients with BRCA2 mutations were germline mutations (Table 1). According to their BRCA1/2 mutation and GSS, We tested the GSS of all patients and divided them into four subgroups, including (1) BRCA1/2+ & GSS≥50; (2) BRCA1/2- & GSS≥50; (3) BRCA1/2+ & GSS＜50; and (4) BRCA1/2- & GSS＜50 (Table 2). According to the definition of HRD, groups (1), (2) and (3) were defined as HRD positive. Approximately 34.7% (51/147) of patients were HRD-positive. Up to 25.2% (37/147) of patients were tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutation but HRD-positive. The HRR mutation rate was 12.9% (19/147), including 84.2% (16/19) HRD-positive and 15.8% (3/19) HRD-negative (Fig. 2B). The mutation rates of ATM, BRAD1, CHEK2, FANCL, and PLAB2 were all 0.7% (1/147). No HRR-positive mutations were detected in BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, or RAD54L. No remaining HRR-positive mutations were found in patients (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 2). The rate of TP53 mutations was higher (62.7%) in HRD-positive patients (62.7% vs. 25.0%, P = 7.27*10^-6<0.05) (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positivity distribution in breast cancer (BC) patients.

### Clinicopathological characteristics of BC patients

The median age of 147 patients was 47.5 (range 17–76) (Table 3). One hundred forty-two were invasive carcinomas, and five were carcinomas in situ. The invasive carcinomas were further classified into five molecular subtypes according to the expression of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67, which were Luminal A (13.4%, 19/142), Luminal B (HER2-) (41.5%, 59/142), Luminal B (HER2+) (13.4%, 19/142), HER2+ (4.9%, 7/142), and TNBC (26.8%, 38/142) (Fig. 3A). Among patients with TNBC, the HRD positivity rate was 60.5% (23/38), and the BRCA mutation positivity rate was 18.4% (7/38). Moreover, 42.1% (16/38) of patients with TNBC were HRD-positive but tested negative for BRCA mutation (Table 3). In the other four subtypes, 26.0% (27/104) of patients tested for HRD-positive, which was much lower than that of patients with TNBC (26.0% VS 60.5% P = 1.35*10−4<0.05) (Table 3).Table 3Clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with HRD status.Table 3CharacteristicsNumber of patients (%)HRD-HRD+P valueOverallBRCA+BRCA-N14796 (65.3%)51 (34.7%)14 (9.5%)37 (25.2%)Age, n (%)0.210＜3522 (15%)18 (81.8%)4 (18.2%)2 (9.1%)2 (9.1%)35–5591 (61.9%)57 (62.6%)34 (37.4%)8 (8.8%)26 (28.6%)＞5534 (23.1%)21 (61.8%)13 (38.2%)4 (11.8%)9 (26.5%)Family history, n (%)0.121No82 (55.8%)58 (70.7%)24 (29.3%)3 (3.7%)21 (25.6%)Yes65 (44.2%)38 (58.5%)27 (41.5%)11 (16.9%)16 (24.6%)Family history of four cancer, n (%)0.085No123 (83.7%)84 (68.3%)39 (31.7%)7 (5.7%)32 (26%)Yes24 (16.3%)12 (50%)12 (50%)7 (29.2%)5 (20.8%)Menopause, n (%)0.858No85 (57.8%)55 (64.7%)30 (35.3%)8 (9.4%)22 (25.9%)Yes62 (42.2%)41 (66.1%)21 (33.9%)6 (9.7%)15 (24.2%)Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, n (%)0.942No109 (74.1%)71 (65.1%)38 (34.9%)12 (11%)26 (23.9%)Yes38 (25.9%)25 (65.8%)13 (34.2%)2 (5.3%)11 (28.9%)Side, n (%)0.588Left88 (59.9%)59 (67%)29 (33%)7 (8%)22 (25%)Right59 (40.1%)37 (62.7%)22 (37.3%)7 (11.9%)15 (25.4%)ER, n (%)<0.001(+)102 (69.4%)77 (75.5%)25 (24.5%)7 (6.9%)18 (17.6%)(−)45 (30.6%)19 (42.2%)26 (57.8%)7 (15.6%)19 (42.2%)PR, n (%)<0.001(+)91 (61.9%)69 (75.8%)22 (24.2%)6 (6.6%)16 (17.6%)(−)56 (38.1%)27 (48.2%)29 (51.8%)8 (14.3%)21 (37.5%)HER2, n (%)0.822(+)27 (18.6%)17 (63%)10 (37%)1 (3.7%)9 (33.3%)(−)118 (81.4%)77 (65.3%)41 (34.7%)13 (11%)28 (23.7%)KI67, n (%)<0.001low40 (27.2%)36 (90%)4 (10%)2 (5%)2 (5%)high107 (72.8%)60 (56.1%)47 (43.9%)12 (11.2%)35 (32.7%)Subtypes, n (%)<0.001Luminal A19 (13.4%)18 (94.7%)1 (5.3%)1 (5.3%)0 (0%)Luminall B (HER2-)59 (41.5%)42 (71.2%)17 (28.8%)5 (8.5%)12 (20.3%)Luminal B(HER2+)19 (13.4%)13 (68.4%)6 (31.6%)1 (5.3%)5 (26.3%)HER2+7 (4.9%)4 (57.1%)3 (42.9%)0 (0%)3 (42.9%)TNBC38 (26.8%)15 (39.5%)23 (60.5%)7 (18.4%)16 (42.1%)T stage, n (%)0.842Tis5 (3.4%)4 (80%)1 (20%)0 (0%)1 (20%)T1 (≤2 cm)80 (54.4%)54 (67.5%)26 (32.5%)6 (7.5%)20 (25%)T2 (＞2 cm, ＜5 cm)51 (34.7%)32 (62.7%)19 (37.3%)6 (11.8%)13 (25.5%)T3 (≥5 cm)7 (4.8%)4 (57.1%)3 (42.9%)1 (14.3%)2 (28.6%)T44 (2.7%)2 (50%)2 (50%)1 (25%)1 (25%)N stage, n (%)0.163N076 (51.7%)46 (60.5%)30 (39.5%)9 (11.8%)21 (27.6%)N151 (34.7%)36 (70.6%)15 (29.4%)4 (7.8%)11 (21.6%)N210 (6.8%)5 (50%)5 (50%)0 (0%)5 (50%)N310 (6.8%)9 (90%)1 (10%)1 (10%)0 (0%)Progression, n (%)0.020No119 (81%)83 (69.7%)36 (30.3%)8 (6.7%)28 (23.5%)Yes28 (19%)13 (46.4%)15 (53.6%)6 (21.4%)9 (32.1%)Fig. 3Relationship between genomic scar score (GSS) and subtypes of BC.

We determined the GSS for each patient as described previously. GSS-high tumors were more likely to be ER/PR-negative (P < 0.001) and exhibited significantly higher Ki-67 expression (P < 0.001) than HRD-negative tumors (Fig. 3B). Subtype analysis revealed that patients with TNBC exhibited higher GSS than Luminal A (P = 2.398 × 10−7 <0.05), Luminal B (HER2-) (P = 1.294 × 10−6 <0.05), and Luminal B (HER2+) (P = 0.004 < 0.05). Luminal B (HER2-) (P = 0.001 < 0.05) and Luminal B (HER2+) (P = 0.001 < 0.05) showed higher GSS than luminal A. Significant differences were not detected in HER2+ compared to other subtypes (Fig. 3C). Moreover, HRD positivity was higher in TNBC (60.5%, 23/38) than in Luminal A (5.3%, 1/19, P = 6.79 × 10−5<0.05), Luminal B (HER2-) (28.8%, 17/59, P = 0.002 < 0.05) and Luminal B (HER2+) (31.6%, 6/19, P = 0.039 < 0.05). HRD positivity was not significantly different among Luminal A, Luminal B (HER2-), Luminal B (HER2+), and HER2+ subtypes (Fig. 3D).

All patients were interviewed to determine their family history of cancer (Supplementary Table 3). 44.2% (65/147) of the patients had a family history of any cancer reviewed. Only 16.3% (24/147) of patients had a family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer. Among patients with a family history, 41.5% (27/65) were HRD-positive. Among patients without a family history, the HRD positivity rate was 29.3% (24/82). However, the difference was not significant (41.5% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.120). We further analyzed the detailed profile of family history in both groups. In the HRD-positive group, the top 4 cancers were: breast cancer (13.7%), lung cancer (13.7%), esophageal cancer (7.8%), and ovarian cancer (3.9%) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Comparison of the distribution of family history among HRD-positive and negative patients.Fig. 4

### Relationship between neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy and HRD status

Thirty-eight patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Fig. 5A). Excluding two patients who had not yet get the operation, 12 were HRD-positive, and 24 were HRD-negative. 50.0% (6/12) of HRD-positive patients achieved pCR, whereas only 8.3% (2/24) of HRD-negative patients achieved pCR (P = 0.009 < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Eleven patients received platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Excluding one patient who had not yet underwent the operation, 60.0% (3/5) of HRD-positive patients achieved pCR, while none of HRD-negative patients achieved pCR.Fig. 5Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for BC.

### The relationship between invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and HRD status

We recorded the iDFS events of all patients. At the time of last follow-up, invasive diseases occurred in 29.4% (15/51) of the HRD-positive patients (Fig. 6A). Recorded invasive diseases included contralateral breast cancer (20.0%), ipsilateral recurrences (26.7%), distant metastasis (33.3%), and second primary cancer (SPC) (20.0%). Distant metastases were mainly located in bone (13.3%), followed by contralateral supraclavicular lymph nodes (6.7%), ovary (6.7%), and liver (6.7%). SPC included gastric cancer (6.7%), pancreatic cancer (6.7%), and ovarian cancer (6.7%) (Fig. 6B). In the HRD-negative patients, disease progression occurred in only 13.5% (13/96) of patients (Fig. 6A), mostly were distant metastases (77.0%), followed by recurrence (15.3%) and SPC (7.7%). Distant metastases were predominantly occurred in the lung (46.2%), followed by bone (23.1%), and only 7.7% in the liver (Fig. 6B). HRD-positive patients were more susceptible to disease progression than the HRD-negative ones (29.4% vs. 13.5%, P = 0.02 < 0.05).Fig. 6Disease progression in BC patients.

### Discussion

Edwin Cuppen et al.'s pan-cancer analysis revealed that the HRD positivity rate in primary ovarian cancer was higher than in primary BC (52% vs. 24%) [7]. However, since the incidence of BC ranked the first among women worldwide [35] and also in China, HRD status in BC should be seriously evaluated in clinical practice. The NCT01372579 study indicated that HRD status could predict pCR rates for neoadjuvant therapy in BC [36]. The PrECOG 0105 study showed that HRD-positive BC patients could benefit greatly from PARPis than HRD-negative patients [37], indicating that assessment for HRD status is necessary for personalized therapy. However, currently, FDA-approved HRD tests are only available for ovarian cancer, and the study population is limited to European-American populations. In China, no HRD test for BC has been officially approved yet. However, efforts have been made to develop accurate and adaptable HRD tests for BC in the Chinese population. In this study, we introduced an original HRD test system, namely AmoyDx HRD Panel based on GSS, and provided clinical data concerning HRD status in BC patients in China.

GSS was developed by a machine learning method called the genomic scar (GS) model, which use different types of chromosomal copy number to evaluate genomic instability to predict HRD event [33]. GSS applied in this HRD test shares two prominent advantages. First, SNPs included in the test are specifically selected from the Chinese population. Second, the division of genomic instability events is more precise. Each CNV type was calculated only once, which would help to avoid redundant information. Tim French et al. showed a good agreement between the GSS-based AmoyDx HRD Panel and the myChoice HRD test. The positive, negative, and overall percent concordance between AmoyDx HRD Panel and Myriad myChoice CDx was 88.0%, 75.0%, and 81.6%, respectively [38]. Noteworthy, the development of the model incorporated data from breast and ovarian cancers. However, the predictive power of GS models in the clinic has only been evaluated in patients with ovarian cancer [33]. Our study on breast cancer patients filled this gap.

We first explored the relationship between BRCA1/2 mutations, HRR mutations, and HRD positivity rates. This study's BRCA1/2 mutation positivity rate was higher than that reported by Yuntao Xie (9.5% vs. 5.3%) [39]. 25.2% of patients were BRCA1/2 mutation negative but HRD positive, indicating that detection of BRCA1/2 mutations alone would miss a large portion of BC patients who may also benefit from PARP inhibitors. Notably, this BRCA1/2 mutation-negative but HRD-positive rate was much higher in TNBC (42.1%). Then we assessed HRR mutations according to O'Shaughnessy J's study and compared the results with our HRD tests [40]. The results showed that HRR mutation was also not consistent or incompatible with HRD. In fact, the rate of HRR mutation positivity was much lower than HRD positivity rate (12.9% vs. 34.7%). Therefore, it is insufficient to detect only BRCA1/2 or HRR mutations in clinical practice to identify patients that were deficient in homologous recombination repair and those who could use PARPis as effective target therapy. Assessment of HRD based on GSS needs to be taken seriously and be further generalized in the clinical setting.

We also investigated the relationship between GSS and the clinicopathological characteristics of BC. The results of subtype analysis revealed that GSS-high tumors were significantly more prevalent in TNBC than in Luminal A, Luminal B (HER2-), and Luminal B (HER2+) subtypes, which is consistent with previous reports [29,41]. Moreover, HRD positivity rate in TNBC (60.5%) was higher than that in unselected BC (34.7%). This tendency is consistent with Imanishi, S's results (51.4% vs. 31.9%) [42]. TNBC subtype shares characteristics including higher recurrence risk and worse prognosis, with limited therapeutic options to choose compared to the hormone receptor-positive and HER-2 positive subtypes. Thus, HRD test should be performed routinely, especially for TNBC patients, to provide them with more therapy options.

It is estimated that hereditary BC accounts for 5–10% of all BC. However, about 70% of hereditary BC are not associated with BRCA1/2 mutations [43], indicating that other genes may also play critical roles in the homologous recombination repair pathway [44]. We explored the relationship between HRD and a family history of certain cancers. Patients with a family history of any cancer reviewed are more likely to be HRD-positive (41.5%) than those without a family history (29.3%). However, the difference was not statistically significant. We consider there are two reasons: the relatively small sample size and follow-up limitations. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutation have a high risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer [45]. Interestingly, we found that relatives of HRD-positive patients were more likely to have a family history of breast cancer, esophageal cancer, and ovarian cancer. Reports concerning this data is rare and we will continue to follow up on these patients in our subsequent study.

Recently many studies have suggested the predictive or prognostic value of HRD status for cancers. For example, HRD-positive BC patients can benefit from PARP inhibitors [20], and HRD status could predict the efficacy of platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy [36]. HRD status was also proved to be associated with the outcome of neoadjuvant therapy without addition of platinum [46]. In this study, we found that the pCR rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was higher in HRD-positive group compared to HRD-negative group (50% vs. 8.3%), which was consistent with GeparSixto study (55.9% vs. 29.8%) [46]. The efficacy of platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy was superior in HRD-positive patients than that in HRD-negative patients. Although the sample size was too small for statistical analysis, the results are similar to other studies, such as the NCT01372579 [36]. In survival analysis, we found that HRD-positive patients were more likely to suffer from contralateral BC. Previous studies have shown that germline variant carriers were more likely to have contralateral breast cancer (11.5% vs. 2.9%) [47]. However, the necessity and determinants of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy have been controversial. Fasano GA et al. demonstrate that TNBC patients without BRCA1/2 mutations had no survival benefit after contralateral prophylactic mastectomy [48]. At present, no other studies have reported an association between HRD status and the risk of contralateral BC. Therefore, an update of the survival and disease development data of these HRD-positive BC patients is warranted to provide a robust reference for clinicians' choices. Additionally, longer follow-ups will be conducted to achieve satisfactory survival results. We also show that distant metastases of HRD-positive BC were predominantly occurred in the lung (46.2%), followed by bone (23.1%), of which the underlying mechanisms are to be revealed.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, we first investigated the HRD status of the Chinese BC patients through an original HRD detection panel developed based on Chinese population. In addition, the clinicopathological characteristics, family history distribution, neoadjuvant efficacy, and disease progression of HRD-positive and negative patients were described and compared. Our data confirmed the feasibility and reliability of this novel HRD assessment system and suggested that more BC patients, especially TNBC subtype, should undergo HRD screening for sufficient assessment and better therapy options.
