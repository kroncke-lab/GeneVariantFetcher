## BRCA1/BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance in clinical practice: A case report

### Abstract

The influence of BRCA1/2 variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) on the cancer risk and their association with the response to treatment is uncertain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of BRCA VUS in patients with breast cancer. A total of two cases of breast cancer patients with the BRCA VUS were described. The complete coding sequence of BRCA1/2 genes was analyzed from the genomic DNA material by next generation sequencing on the Ion Torrent platform. The presence of c.3454G>A (p.Asp1152Asn) VUS in the BRCA1 gene was reported in a 64-year-old woman with invasive breast carcinoma. The characteristics of the breast tumors were the following: moderately differentiated-intermediate grade (NG-2 G-2), HER2 (+), estrogen receptor (ER) (+++), progesterone receptor (PR) (+++), luminal A subtype and pT2 N1a Mx. The second detected VUS was the c.2374T>C (p.Tyr792His) variant in the BRCA2 gene. This variant was reported in a 33-year-old woman who was diagnosed with right breast cancer (cT2N1M0). The invasive breast carcinoma was characterized as follows: NG-2 G-2, ER (+++), PR (+++), Ki-67 10%, HER2 (+++) and luminal B subtype. The data demonstrated that patients with VUSs should be managed based on their family history of cancer and clinicopathological characteristics. The clinical significance of the VUS in BRCA1/2 may change over time and reclassification of the variant to ‘pathogenic’ or ‘benign’ should be undertaken. Patients with VUS should be followed up regularly.
