## A phenomap of TTR amyloidosis to aid diagnostic screening

### Abstract

AbstractCardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin (ATTR) remains an underdiagnosed cause of cardiomyopathy. As awareness of the disease grows and referrals for ATTR increase, clinicians are likely to encounter more atypical forms of the condition in clinical practice. Therefore, physicians and treating cardiologists should be aware of the full phenotypic spectrum of ATTR. The phenotypic manifestation of ATTR varies depending on the stage of the disease, the presence and type of TTR mutation and the patient's comorbidities. ATTR findings can be grouped into four major categories: clinical profile and cardiac phenotype, extra‐cardiac findings, electrocardiogram and imaging findings, which cumulatively form the full phenomap of ATTR. Results from any diagnostic test for ATTR should be interpreted in light of the pre‐test probability for the disease. Findings that suggest negative markers for ATTR can point towards other forms of amyloidosis (such as AL amyloidosis) or alternate causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or Fabry disease. The rising number of referrals for ATTR cardiomyopathy presents a challenge in daily clinical practice. To prevent an increase in false‐positive diagnostic test results, an ATTR phenomap can serve as a valuable tool for guiding diagnostic assessments, interpreting test outcomes and prioritizing appropriate referrals for ATTR screening.

### Introduction

The two most common subtypes of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are AL amyloidosis due to plasma cell dyscrasias and amyloidosis due to transthyretin (ATTR). Even though AL has been considered to account for most cases of CA, advances in diagnostic screening over the recent years have shown that ATTR is much more prevalent in the elderly population than previously thought.

TTR protein normally forms a tetramer that functions as a transporter for the thyroid hormone thyroxine and vitamin A (retinol). The tetrameric form of TTR, when destabilized, dissolves into monomers that become misfolded and form insoluble amyloid fibrils that are deposited in various organs.
2
 Hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR) is caused by a pathologic mutation in the TTR gene that promotes the deposition of TTR protein while wild‐type ATTR (wtATTR) is caused by the destabilization of the TTR tetramer in older patients, especially males.
1
 Specific subpopulations seem to be more frequently affected by this condition, as, for instance, patients with severe aortic stenosis, where the reported ATTR prevalence can be as high as 11%–16%.

 Although the vast majority of elderly males diagnosed with ATTR have the wild‐type form, genetic testing should be offered to all patients. Diagnosing hATTR is crucial, as it can guide therapeutic interventions and facilitate family screening.
5

Even though many symptoms and signs are considered as red flags for ATTR, not all clinical findings are encountered equally often in clinical practice or are specific to ATTR. With this commentary, we aim to thoroughly describe the phenotypic presentations of ATTR and provide a critical appraisal of diagnostic screening algorithm to aid in the timely and accurate disease diagnosis.

### Phenotypes of transthyretin amyloidosis

The phenotypic presentation of ATTR can range depending on the disease stage, the presence and type of a TTR mutation and the underlying patient comorbidities.
6
 ATTR findings can be categorized into four main categories: clinical profile and cardiac phenotype, extra‐cardiac findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) and imaging findings.

The clinical spectrum ranges from predominant neurologic to predominant cardiac involvement.
6

TTR gene mutations, such as the early‐onset Val30Met, present with a predominant neurologic involvement, while late‐onset Val30Met is associated with a mixed phenotype. Val122Ile TTR mutation (present in ~3% of Afro‐Caribbean population) may lead to a predominant cardiac phenotype.
6
 wtATTR predominantly affects elderly males (mean age at time of diagnosis 70 years, ~85% males)
7
 and should be suspected in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and clinical characteristics like coexistent severe aortic stenosis or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, as these subgroups are enriched in ATTR.

 Even though ATTR is considered to be a disease affecting mainly male patients, biopsy studies have shown a high incidence of amyloid TTR tissue deposition in female patients. This probably suggests that the disease remains underdiagnosed in women, probably due to a lower level of suspicion and/or a milder disease presentation.

, 
10
, 
11
 ATTR‐CM patients usually present with heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, peripheral oedema, fatigue, weight loss and exercise intolerance. These common manifestations can make it challenging to distinguish ATTR‐CM from other forms of heart failure.
12

Frequent extra‐cardiac findings include orthostatic hypotension (~30% of patients), burning pain or numbness in extremities (~20% of patients), proteinuria/chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a medical history of orthopaedic surgeries.
6
, 
12
 Patients reporting biceps tendon rupture, spinal cord stenosis and carpal tunnel syndrome especially when combined with LVH, are much more likely to get diagnosed with the disease, as these signs are considered fairly disease‐specific.
6
, 
7
, 
12
 Patients with unilateral or bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in particular, are at a significantly elevated risk of being diagnosed with ATTR later in life, making this condition a strong predictor of ATTR.
13
 CKD in ATTR is not due to amyloid deposition in kidneys like in other amyloidosis subtypes (such as AL or Apolipoprotein IV, and Alect2), but is rather associated with the advanced age of patients with wtATTR and/or advanced myocardial disease and presence of cardiorenal syndrome, especially in decompensated patients. Hence, proteinuria is not typical for ATTR and should raise suspicion for other possible causes or underlying AL amyloidosis.

ECG may show decreased QRS voltage to mass ratio, atrial fibrillation (~60% of patients), or conduction disease (bundle branch blocks/atrio‐ventricular blocks ~75% of patients). These findings are frequently encountered in ATTR but are non‐specific for the disease.
6
, 
7
 Presence of pseudo‐Q waves/pseudo‐infarction pattern (~55% of patients) is typically associated with advanced myocardial disease.
7
 The presence of T‐wave inversion in the setting of LVH (e.g., in the inferolateral leads) is not typical for CA and should steer diagnosis towards other differentials (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). The coexistence of ECG findings such as QT‐prolongation,
6
 cardiac paced rhythm (pacemaker implantation due to bradyarrhythmias), low QRS voltages (~31%–46% of patients) and especially reduced QRS voltage to mass ratio are associated with a higher likelihood of an ATTR diagnosis.
6
, 
7

Imaging findings such as LVH (~97% of patients), right ventricular hypertrophy, the existence of pericardial effusion (~55% of patients), restrictive physiology (~39% of patients) and thickened valves are non‐specific markers frequently found in patients with CA.
6
, 
7
 LVH is concentric but rarely symmetrical, typically showing a predilection for the intraventricular septum and the basal LV segments. Echocardiographic findings more specific to CA are the low mitral annular systolic and diastolic velocities (s′, e′, a′), the apical sparing pattern on global longitudinal strain study, biatrial dilation and presence of atrial standstill.
6
, 
12
 The ‘sparkling’ appearance of the LV myocardium is a subjective and non‐specific finding, as it can be observed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and storage diseases too. Due to hypercontractility of apical segments (which is due to less amyloid deposition) and the hypokinesia of basal LV segments, LV outflow obstruction is almost never observed in CA. Typical CA findings from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are those observed by cine imaging, which equal those of echocardiography. However, CMR tissue characteristics are most important for CA diagnosis and include the abnormal kinetics of gadolinium and typical late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) patterns, for instance, global subendocardial to transmural LGE, as well as highly increased native T1 mapping and extracardiac volume.

, 
14
 It is important to mention that, even though all three CMR markers provide good diagnostic and prognostic information, the latter is considered the most accurate in diagnosing CA.

 Each individual patient suspected for ATTR is not expected to have all relevant symptoms and signs, but the greater the number of red flags is, the higher the pre‐test likelihood for the disease is and therefore referral for screening is mandated.

### Critical appraisal of the diagnostic work‐up for ATTR

The diagnosis of ATTR has become easier in the recent years with the help of imaging.
12
 In most cases of ATTR, invasive tissue biopsy (cardiac or extracardiac) is not required to set the diagnosis. Biopsies are typically reserved for challenging cases that pose diagnostic dilemmas, like cases with non‐confirmatory imaging findings or those with positive bone scan scintigraphy and simultaneous abnormal haematological tests in which the clinical possibility of AL amyloidosis cannot be safely ruled out.

Recent clinical recommendations
8
 advocate the screening of any patient with LVH, that is, maximal wall thickness (MWT) ≥12 mm, and at least one red flag for CA.
8
 The hallmark of CA is LVH although the cut‐off point of 12 mm is neither sex‐ nor body size‐ indexed. Nonetheless, it sets an indicative MWT above which the pre‐test likelihood for suspicion for CA is sufficiently high to trigger diagnostic screening. Suggestions have been made to lower the MWT cut‐off point to 11 mm for women, in order to increase the sensitivity of the screening algorithm in this patient group. However, this has not been addressed in the current expert consensus on ATTR
8
 and remains to be further explored, as a lower cut‐off point could decrease screening specificity.
18

Importantly, even though the diagnosis of ATTR is guided by the presence of specific red flags, each sign is characterized by different specificity and sensitivity for the disease. This is not depicted in the diagnostic algorithm of CA,
8
 as all red flags are equally appraised during patient screening. It should also be noted that the application of ESC clinical recommendation algorithm for CA screening provides the maximum sensitivity (in order not to lose one single case of CA) but on the other hand falls short in terms of specificity. Application of this screening algorithm in clinical practice may mean that a large number of patients may require referral for CA screening. Notably, the increased number of referrals for suspected CA over the recent years has been paralleled by significant increases in the rates of false positive results of diagnostic tests.
8
, 
19

Given that the post‐test likelihood of any positive test relies on Bayesian principles, the result of any diagnostic test should be viewed in the context of the pre‐test probability for the disease. Factors that may inflate false positive results is to rely solely on CMR findings and/or the use 99mtechnetium‐pyrophosphate.
19
 The choice of radiotracer (e.g., DPD, PYP or HMDP) can significantly influence scintigraphy results and further comparative studies of these specific radiotracers used in ATTR diagnosis are needed.
20
 Additionally, extensive cardiac calcifications, non‐specific for ATTR radiotracers or acquisition of scintigraphy imaging shots at 1 h instead of 3 h after the administration of the tracer, can lead to false positive results that are attributed to insufficiently attenuated blood pool activity.
21
 The issue of false negative or false positive applies also to histopathological techniques like Congo red staining.
8
, 
19
 The false results of biopsies can be attributed either to technical difficulties in the staining method or false diagnostic interpretation by the pathologist, that is, identifying fibrous tissue or thrombus as amyloid.

Several scores have been proposed to estimate the pretest probability for ATTR. The ATTR‐CM score is a validated score used to predict the likelihood of ATTR in patients presenting with HFpEF. A total number of six parameters are included in the score, and a cut‐off of 6 points predicts underlying ATTR with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 62%.
22
 Similarly, the T‐Amylo score uses five parameters to estimate the likelihood of ATTR presence in patients entering the CA diagnostic algorithm (MWT ≥ 12 mm and at least one more ATTR red flag). Patients can be stratified in three groups based on the T‐Amylo score, that is, low risk (0–2 points), intermediate risk (3–6 points) and high risk (7–11 points) for ATTR. The low‐risk group predicted ATTR‐CM with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 41% while the high‐risk groups had a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 95% for ATTR‐CM.
23
 RAISE score has also been established to predict latent ATTR in patients with severe aortic stenosis.
24
 A total number of seven parameters are included in the score. Using a cut‐off limit of 2 points, the score achieves 94% sensitivity and 72% specificity in diagnosing underlying ATTR. A detailed presentation comparison of all three scores is provided in Table
1. Adding to the aforementioned scores, prediction models that can estimate the probability of ATTR‐CM in the general population have been developed.

The challenges in accurate diagnosis of ATTR underline the necessity of referring possible ATTR patients to expert amyloidosis centres where imaging and histopathology specialists are well‐versed in the pitfalls of diagnosis. These centres have the necessary expertise to accurately interpret diagnostic results considering technical issues and minimize the risk of false positive or false negative results. Notably, patients with false‐positive results are more frequently people of colour, women and of lower living standards.
19
 Furthermore, patients that have been falsely diagnosed with amyloidosis may have lower NT‐proBNP and troponin I values compared with actual CA cases and a degree of LVH less profound.
19
 False‐positive results create a significant challenge in everyday clinical practice as patients may be flagged with a false diagnosis and can even be inappropriately treated for a long period of time. Inappropriately diagnosing such patients is damaging not only for their physical but also for their mental health and is linked with serious psychological distress.

### Distinguishing between AL and TTR amyloidosis

Although many symptoms can be common between AL and ATTR, the presentation of the patients often differs and can point towards the underlying amyloidosis type.
12
, 
26
 The male sex predominance in ATTR is not seen in AL, and therefore, a rule of thumb is that younger and female patients are more likely to have non‐ATTR disease.
27
 Disease course may be dramatic in AL with rapid progression to end‐stage heart failure. On the other hand, ATTR typically shows a slower progression with clinical symptoms of heart failure usually developing late in the disease course, that is, 5–10 years post‐surgery for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
28

AL amyloidosis is associated with certain pathognomonic extracardiac features, including acquired factor X deficiency, submandibular gland enlargement, periorbital purpura and macroglossia.
12
, 
28
 Among the ECG findings, low QRS voltages, even though relatively specific for both CA types, are significantly more frequently seen in AL amyloidosis.
12
, 
27
 Imaging by either echocardiography or CMR is not useful for discrimination between the two subtypes, and even Tc99m bone scintigraphy may be positive in up to 20% of patients with AL amyloidosis.
21
 Patients with ATTR are of older age and may report more frequently cardiac symptoms,
27
 isolated or in combination with neurological or orthopaedic problems, such as spinal cord stenosis or biceps tendon rupture (Popeye's sign).
27
, 
28

Distinguishing between AL amyloidosis and ATTR is of great importance, given the substantially different natural disease course as well as targeted treatments.
21
 Even though both CA types are linked with a poor prognosis, AL amyloidosis is a medical emergency. Haematological work‐up (comprised by serum free‐light chain quantification and serum and urine immunofixation) should never be delayed due to a higher suspicion for ATTR as the two most common amyloidosis types cannot be accurately differentiated through clinical profile and echocardiographic or CMR findings. Delaying treatment due to false diagnosis of ATTR can be fatal for the patient.
27
 Patients should be promptly referred to a hematologic clinic so that treatment can be initiated.

### Conclusions

Despite the improvements in diagnostic modalities and increase in awareness, ATTR still remains an underdiagnosed clinical entity. Delayed diagnosis at later disease stages can significantly affect patient prognosis as extensive amyloid deposition on the heart muscle and restrictive cardiomyopathy are already established and non‐reversible. On the other edge of the spectrum of diagnostic sensitivity, increased referrals in the inappropriate setting may inflate the rates of false positive findings of diagnostic tests. Clinicians should keep in mind that the post‐test probability is dependent on the pre‐test likelihood, which can be roughly evaluated by the number of red flags for ATTR. Restrictions in local logistics or available resources in each country may mandate a different approach to screening strategies, and therefore, patients at greater pre‐test likelihood for ATTR may need prioritization.
