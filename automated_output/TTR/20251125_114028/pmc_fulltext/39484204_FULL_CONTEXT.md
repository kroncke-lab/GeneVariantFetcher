## Classification of Infiltrative Heart Diseases MORAL-STAGE System

### Abstract

Infiltrative heart disease (InHD) is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances in the heart tissue, causing diastolic, less often systolic, dysfunction of the ventricle(s). Their classification still does not exist. In 2013, the MOGE(S) classification of cardiomyopathies was published, taking into account, along with the morphological and functional characteristics of the heart, damage to other organs, the presence of genetic mutations, acquired causes (e.g., myocardial inflammation, autoimmune diseases, storage diseases, amyloidosis), etc. By analogy with it we offer the MORAL-STAGE classification for InHD. It includes ten features: morphofunctional characteristics (M), organ damage (O), risk of cardiac death (R), age of clinical presentation, age of disease-specific therapy initiation (A), localization of the infiltrative process (inside or outside the cell, L), information about the functional class heart failure and stage of infiltrative heart disease (S), treatment (T), abnormal rhythm or conduction (A), genetic or familial nature of inheritance (G), etiology of the process (E). This article summarizes the cornerstones of the MORAL-STAGE classification and its clinical relevance. In addition, new issues are discussed that can be considered in future versions of the MORAL-STAGE classification.

### Introduction

Infiltrative heart disease (InHD) is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of abnormal substances in the heart tissue, causing diastolic, less commonly systolic, dysfunction of the ventricle(s). InHD is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, glycogen storage diseases, (Danon’s disease), Fabry disease, Wegener’s granulomatosis, Friedreich’s ataxia, mucopolysaccharidoses, cardiac oxalosis, Gaucher disease, hypereosinophilic myocardial lesions, etc.1

For various diseases, classification systems provide physicians with the tools to accurately describe the pathology. Seward JB divides all InHD into 2 groups: (1) InHD, which look like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or hypertensive heart, and (2) InHD, which look like ischemic or non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
1
 This phenotypic classification does not take into account gender, age of clinical presentation, rate of progression, the presence of genetic mutations, the risk of developing clinically apparent heart failure and sudden death, as well as the possibility of the transition of the HCM phenotype to DCM during the progression of InHD and a number of other characteristics of the disease. In addition to this classification, a universal classification of InHD has not yet been developed.

The TNM tumor staging system in oncology
5
 and the MOGE(S) classification of cardiomyopathies, published in 2013,
6
 prompted us to come up with the idea of the InHD classification—MORAL-STAGE system, which is described in detail below.

### MORAL-STAGE Classification

The MORAL-STAGE classification takes into account 10 features (Table 1): morphological and functional phenotype (M), organ damage (O), risk of death from cardiovascular causes (R), age of clinical presentation and disease-specific therapy initiation (A), localization of the pathogenetic process (L), information about the functional status of heart failure, stage of InHD (S), treatment (T), abnormal rhythm or conduction (A), genetic mutations and inheritance pattern (G), etiology (E).

MORAL-STAGE classification.

### M—Morpho-Functional Phenotype

The letter “M” corresponds to the cardiac phenotype, or morpho-functional type. The phenotype is proposed to indicate in the form of 1 letter of the corresponding form of the CM: MD (DCM), MH (HCM), MR (restrictive CM). A combination of different phenotypes is possible. HCM with a pronounced restrictive pattern is proposed to be described as MH + D. The development of dilatation as the initially hypertrophic phenotype progresses is proposed to be described as MH + D. When describing the morphofunctional phenotype, it is advisable to reflect the so-called “red flags” of amyloidosis and other infiltrative diseases, such as a short PR interval (↓PR), pathological Q wave (Q), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), atrioventricular block (AVB), low QRS voltage on electrocardiography (ECG, ↓QRS). This can be displayed as MH[PR], MH[WPW] or MD[AVB], MH[↓QRS]. These red flags should be placed in square brackets after the designation of the morpho-functional phenotype. The letter E can indicate the early stage of heart damage before the formation of a certain phenotype, NS-nonspecific variant. Carriers of InHD-associated mutations without cardiac involvement are referred to as M0. When information on the cardiac phenotype is not available, such as in deceased relatives, the MNA (not appropriate) description is used.

### O—Organs Involved

The letter “O” denotes organ damage. There may be an isolated lesion of the heart (OH) or a combination of damage to it and other organs, such as skeletal muscles (OH + M), auditory system (OH + A), kidneys (OH + K), nervous system (OH + N), liver (OH + Li), gastrointestinal tract (OH + G), skin (OH + C), eyes (OH + E), lungs (OH + Lu), lymph nodes (Ly). The absence of signs of damage to organs and systems is designated O0. The multiorganism of the lesion should help to suspect an infiltrative pathology.

### R—Cardiovascular Mortality Risk

The letter “R” corresponds to the patient’s cardiovascular mortality risk at the moment of assessment. Risk stratification for InHD is necessary to calculate the risk of death in a particular patient, justify the need for a timely decision to start therapy. To date there has not been any widely accepted risk scale for InHD. However, for reference, we proposed 2 scales: the 5-year risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) according to the HCM risk SCD scale in % and the 3-year risk of mortality for patients with CHF according to the MAGGIC scale in %.7,8 For example, RSCD 25, HF 19—5-year risk of SCD according to the HCM risk SCD scale of 25%, 3-year risk of mortality according to the MAGGIC scale of 19% (Tables 2 and 3).

Scale HCM-risk SCD (with modification
7
).

MAGGIC-HF scale (modified.
8
 The scale is available to users on the Internet at www.heartfailurerisk.org).

ACE, inhibitors angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

These scales have many limitations because different diseases may present differently, but they can completely be replaced by more accurate scales in the future, or separate scales for each specific disease with similar expressions: scale name—risk (in percentage or level).

### A—Age of Clinical Presentation, Age of Disease-Specific Therapy Initiation

The designation “A” includes a description of the age of clinical presentation and age of disease-specific therapy initiation. For example, A20-24 the first clinical symptoms appeared in a patient at the age of 20, and he receives disease-specific therapy since he was 24 years old. If for some reason disease-specific therapy has not been initiated, the second number may be left blank. According to these informations, clinician can understand how long the patient was on therapy, how long the delay between disease onset and treatment initiation was, and evaluate the effect of treatment depend on the age of its initiation or its duration.

### L—Localization of Pathological Process Outside or Inside the Cell

The letter “L” denotes intracellular or extracellular localization of the pathological process. LO—pathological process outside cells (for example, in amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), LI—pathological process inside cells (e.g., in Fabry disease, Danon’s disease), LOI—pathological process is localized both outside and inside cells (e.g., in hemochromatosis, oxalose).

### S—Stage

The letter “S” describes the stage of InHD, the stage of HF (according to ACC/AHA staging system) and the functional class of HF according to NYHA (from I to IV). By analogy with the stages of hypertension,
8
 the staging of InHD should take into account the degree of damage to the heart (Figure 1):

Stage 1 (preclinical)—the stage of infiltration, the accumulation of substances in the heart begins, visualized microscopically. Patients are mostly asymptomatic and the standard clinical and imaging evaluation does not reveal any pathology. There may be an increase in specific biomarkers, initial changes on MRI and ECG.

Stage 2 (manifestations)—structural stage (pseudohypertrophy of the myocardium, thickening of the valves, valvular defects, fibrosis, dilatation of the heart chambers, etc.) and functional changes in the heart: (diastolic dysfunction, obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle, etc.). Changes are detected during echocardiography, MRI, DPD scintigraphy, etc. In addition, the infiltrative process can be indirectly detected by a pathologically elevated level of highly sensitive troponin T. Clinically, this can manifest itself as unexplained chronic fatigue, decreased physical activity. The clinical picture of HF is not typical, the level of NT-proBNP, BNP is within the normal range.

Stage 3—chronic heart failure. It is characterized by fibrosis from local to diffuse. With echocardiography, structural and functional anomalies of the heart are more pronounced, incl. pseudohypertrophy and/or dilatation with impaired local contractility. Increased levels of highly sensitive troponin and NT-proBNP. Clinically, shortness of breath, rhythm and conduction disturbances are detected, in some cases requiring the installation of a pacemaker or implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.

Staging of cardiac damage in patients with infiltrative heart diseases.

BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; HF, chronic heart failure; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; NT-proBNP, N-terminal fragment of probrain natriuretic peptide.

Understanding and identifying the 3 stages of cardiac involvement in patients with InHD is important for management. In the context of disease-specific therapy, it may appear that the long-term success of treatment is related to the stage of initiation of therapy. In addition, all of the described pathological processes and pathways may become therapeutic targets in the future.

For example, S1-A-0 denotes the first stage of InHD (infiltration stage), HF has not yet developed; S3-C-II denotes the third stage of InHD (HF stage), HF stage C according to ACC/AHA staging system, HF II according to NYHA (Figure 1).

### T—Treatment

The letter “T” indicates what treatment the patient was prescribed, T0 indicates that the patient was not treated before the current visit to the doctor, TS carry out symptomatic therapy (treatment of HF, arrhythmias), you can specify a method of treatment: TS [HF]—treatment of HF, TS[ICD]—implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator, TS[PM]—implantation of a permanent pacemaker, TS[CRT-D], TS[CRT-P]—cardiac resynchronization therapy, TDS—disease-specific therapy, after that you can specify which medicine.

### A—Abnormal Rhythm or Conduction

The letter “A” indicates what type of abnormal rhythm or conduction occurs in the patient, A0—no arrhythmia, AAf—atrial fibrillation, AVT—ventricular tachycardia, etc., a combination is possible as AAf + VT—atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, AAVRT—atrioventricular reciprocal tachycardia, ALBBB—left bundle branch block.

### G—Genetic

The letter “G” describes the type of inheritance, determined clinically based on pedigree analysis and genetic testing: autosomal dominant (GAD), autosomal recessive (GAR), X-linked (GXL), X-linked recessive (GXLR) or dominant (GXLD), etc. Patients with a phenotypically sporadic (GS) It is also possible to indicate a negative or unknown family history (GN or GU) and a family history not yet investigated (G0).

### E—Etiology

The designation “E” includes a description of 2 points. The first testifies to the genetic (EG) or non-genetic nature of InHD. For an unidentified cause, designate EN. The second point is the designation of the exact etiology. For example, an indication of a mutation of a specific gene next to EG or an indication of the cause of the underlying disease in non-genetic InHD.

For example, in the case of familial amyloidosis (EG-ATTR [p.Val122Ile]), Fabry disease (EG-GLA [p.Trp340X]), Friedreich’s ataxia (EG-FXN), mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IV (EG-GALNS). The color code assigned to each variant can provide information about the potential role of the identified variant: pathogenic or probably pathogenic (red); variant of indeterminate value (yellow); non-pathogenic variant (green). The “E” specification can describe: family members who are not carriers of the family disease-causing mutation (EG-Neg), obligate carrier (EG-OC), or obligate non-carrier (EG-ONC). EG-NA indicates that a genetic test is not available. EG-0 indicates that genetic testing was not performed or was not possible for any reason.

In non-genetic InHD, the etiology can be described as sarcoidosis (ES), non-inherited amyloidosis (EAL, EAA, etc.), secondary hemochromatosis in thalassemia (EH-T), oxalosis (EO).

Like the MOGE(S) system, MORAL-STAGE provides flexibility and can be expanded as needed. The authors believe that the nomenclature will evolve to become more complete and user-friendly as clinicians begin to put it into practice.

On first reading, MORAL-STAGE may seem like a complex nosological system, which further complicates the description of InHD. However, in practice it is quite simple to apply. The use of MORAL-STAGE does not oblige the physician to complete all fields, including genetic testing. As shown in the table, genetic tests may or may not be available. However, clinicians should make an effort to obtain a family history, especially for sudden death, and document family patterns. This system also requires the routine diagnosis of InHD in probands and relatives. Whether or not all information requested by MORAL-STAGE is immediately available does not preclude its use. In everyday practice, MORAL-STAGE can be used at the bedside and the collected data can be easily sent as a diagnosis code. In the discharge report, the final diagnosis can provide comprehensive information about the patient. The MORAL-STAGE system is a dynamic parameter that can change during follow-up.

The current version of the MORAL STAGE classification system has a number of limitations that require future research and development. Firstly, the assessment of the risk of cardiovascular death is based on general scales for HCM and HF, there is no specific scale for InHD while this patient group has diverse etiologies. Therefore, the calculated values are for reference only and the values will be lower than the actual risk in patients. Second, the treatment section only states the type of therapy, treatment medication, and age of disease-specific therapy initiation but does not show the level of patient compliance with the treatment regimen or treatment effectiveness. Authors will research further to be able to express it more concisely and fully. Third, the presentation of information on the classification system is quite long, which can make it difficult for doctors to get acquainted. The author will find a solution so that the code letters (MORAL STAGE) and their related information have a more reasonable distribution. Hopefully in future versions the classification system will be more neat and convenient to use.

### Advantage and accessibility

Like the MOGE(S) system, MORAL-STAGE provides flexibility and can be expanded as needed. The authors believe that the nomenclature will evolve to become more complete and user-friendly as clinicians begin to put it into practice.

On first reading, MORAL-STAGE may seem like a complex nosological system, which further complicates the description of InHD. However, in practice it is quite simple to apply. The use of MORAL-STAGE does not oblige the physician to complete all fields, including genetic testing. As shown in the table, genetic tests may or may not be available. However, clinicians should make an effort to obtain a family history, especially for sudden death, and document family patterns. This system also requires the routine diagnosis of InHD in probands and relatives. Whether or not all information requested by MORAL-STAGE is immediately available does not preclude its use. In everyday practice, MORAL-STAGE can be used at the bedside and the collected data can be easily sent as a diagnosis code. In the discharge report, the final diagnosis can provide comprehensive information about the patient. The MORAL-STAGE system is a dynamic parameter that can change during follow-up.

### Limitations

The current version of the MORAL STAGE classification system has a number of limitations that require future research and development. Firstly, the assessment of the risk of cardiovascular death is based on general scales for HCM and HF, there is no specific scale for InHD while this patient group has diverse etiologies. Therefore, the calculated values are for reference only and the values will be lower than the actual risk in patients. Second, the treatment section only states the type of therapy, treatment medication, and age of disease-specific therapy initiation but does not show the level of patient compliance with the treatment regimen or treatment effectiveness. Authors will research further to be able to express it more concisely and fully. Third, the presentation of information on the classification system is quite long, which can make it difficult for doctors to get acquainted. The author will find a solution so that the code letters (MORAL STAGE) and their related information have a more reasonable distribution. Hopefully in future versions the classification system will be more neat and convenient to use.

### Conclusion

The dramatic increase in knowledge of InHD requires a standardized, universally acceptable classification system. The flexible MORAL-STAGE system facilitates the transition from classical medicine to the digital age of describing InHD and collects a huge amount of data that can be lost if it is not systematically recorded. The use of the MORAL-STAGE system requires a description of the results achieved at all stages of diagnosis, including clinical and cardiological examination, extracardiac examination, clinical genetics, family screening, if possible, molecular genetic analysis, morphological and histological analysis, functional status, risk stratification, as well as patient therapy. The classification provides a single language and simple, identical information to collect. It is like an individual diagnosis code for the patient, it gives the doctor a detailed idea of the disease, the patient’s condition, his approach, and also suggests the doctor further tactics.
