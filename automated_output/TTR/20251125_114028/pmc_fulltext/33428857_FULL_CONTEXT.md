## Epigenomic Profiles of African American Transthyretin Val122Ile Carriers Reveals Putatively Dysregulated Amyloid Mechanisms

### Abstract

Background -The Val122Ile mutation in Transthyretin (TTR) gene causes a rare, difficult to diagnose hereditary form of cardiac amyloidosis. This mutation is most common in the United States and mainly present in people of African descent. The carriers have an increased risk of congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, and several other non-cardiac phenotypes such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and arthroplasty which are top reasons for ambulatory/outpatient surgeries in the country.Methods -We conducted first-ever epigenome-wide association study using the Illumina’s EPIC array, in Val122Ile carriers of African descent for heart disease (HD) and multiple outpatient surgeries (OS) - an early disease indicator. Differential methylation across genome wide CpG sites was tested between carriers with and without HD and OS. Significant CpG sites were investigated for cis-mQTLs loci, followed by gene ontology and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We also investigated the significant CpG sites in a secondary cohort of carriers for replication.Results -Five differentially methylated sites (p≤2.1e-08) in genes – FAM129B, SKI, WDR27, GLS, and an intergenic site near RP11-550A5.2, and one differentially methylated region containing KCNA6 and GALNT3 (p=1.1e-12) were associated with HD. For OS, we observe four sites – two sites in UBE2E3 and SEC14L5, and other two in intergenic regions (p≤1.8e-07) and three regions overlapping SH3D21, EVA1B, LTB4R2 and CIDEB (p≤3.9e-07). Functional protein-interaction module analysis identified ABCA1 (p=0.001) for HD. Six cis-mQTLs were associated with one of the significant CpG sites (FAM129B; p=4.1e-24). We replicated two CpG sites (cg18546846 and cg06641417; p<0.05) in an external cohort of biopsy- confirmed cases of TTR amyloidosis. The genes identified are involved in transport and clearance of amyloid deposits (GLS, ABCA1, FAM129B); cardiac fibrosis (SKI); and muscle tissue regulation (SKI, FAM129B).Conclusions -These findings highlight the link between a complex amyloid circuit and diverse symptoms of Val122Ile.
