## The Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated Degradation of Transthyretin
 Variants Is Negatively Regulated by BiP in Mammalian
 Cells*S⃞

### Abstract

Amyloid fibril formation of mutant transthyretin (TTR) that causes familial
 amyloid polyneuropathy occurs in the extracellular space. Thus, secretion of
 TTR variants contributes to the pathogenesis of amyloidosis. However, the
 molecular mechanisms underlying the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit or
 retention and subsequent degradation of TTR variants remain unclear. Here, we
 demonstrated that the nonsecreted TTR variants, such as D18G TTR and
 amyloidogenic TTRs with introduced monomeric mutation (M-TTRs), stably
 interact with the ER chaperone BiP in mammalian cells. These proteins were
 co-secreted with the secreted form of BiP in which the KDEL signal was
 removed, indicating that BiP partially contributes to the ER retention of
 nonsecreted TTR variants. More interestingly, the degradation efficiency of
 nonsecreted TTRs was increased when BiP was down-regulated by small
 interfering RNA. Thus, BiP protects the TTR variants from immediate
 degradation. Additionally, we showed that the stability of nonsecreted TTR
 variants is not disturbed in the coat complex II-deficient conditions, which
 are enough to inhibit the ER export of secreted TTR variants, including
 wild-type TTR. Therefore, the post-ER retrieval mechanism might not contribute
 to the ER-associated degradation of nonsecreted TTR variants. These findings
 suggest that the affinity to the ER-resident protein BiP regulates the fate of
 TTR variants in the ER.
