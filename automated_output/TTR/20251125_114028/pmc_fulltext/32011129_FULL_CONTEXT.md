## Transthyretin Inhibits Primary and Secondary Nucleations
of Amyloid-β Peptide Aggregation and Reduces the Toxicity
of Its Oligomers

### Abstract

Alzheimer’s
disease is associated with the deposition of
the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) into extracellular senile plaques
in the brain. In vitro and in vivo observations have indicated that
transthyretin (TTR) acts as an Aβ scavenger in the brain, but
the mechanism has not been fully resolved. We have monitored the aggregation
process of Aβ40 by thioflavin T fluorescence, in
the presence or absence of different concentrations of preformed seed
aggregates of Aβ40, of wild-type tetrameric TTR (WT-TTR),
and of a variant engineered to be stable as a monomer (M-TTR). Both
WT-TTR and M-TTR were found to inhibit specific steps of the process
of Aβ40 fibril formation, which are primary and secondary
nucleations, without affecting the elongation of the resulting fibrils.
Moreover, the analysis shows that both WT-TTR and M-TTR bind to Aβ40 oligomers formed in the aggregation reaction and inhibit
their conversion into the shortest fibrils able to elongate. Using
biophysical methods, TTR was found to change some aspects of its overall
structure following such interactions with Aβ40 oligomers,
as well as with oligomers of Aβ42, while maintaining
its overall topology. Hence, it is likely that the predominant mechanism
by which TTR exerts its protective role lies in the binding of TTR
to the Aβ oligomers and in inhibiting primary and secondary
nucleation processes, which limits both the toxicity of Aβ oligomers
and the ability of the fibrils to proliferate.

### Introduction

Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is an increasingly prevalent form
of dementia that involves a loss of memory, cognitive ability, and
behavioral stability. It has long been known that its main histopathological
hallmarks are the presence of extracellular lesions, called senile
plaques, and of intracellular bundles, called neurofibrillary tangles,1,2 which are known to be composed primarily of amyloid fibrils of the
amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and of abnormal straight filaments
or paired helical filaments formed by the protein tau, respectively.3

The involvement of transthyretin (TTR)
in the process of Aβ
fibril formation was first reported more than 20 years ago, when it
was found that TTR, among the proteins present in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), was able to bind to Aβ40 and form stable
complexes.4 Such an interaction was found
to be able to inhibit amyloid fibril formation by Aβ-derived
peptides in vitro, as observed with thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence,
Congo red birefringence, and transmission electron microscopy.4 The interaction of TTR with Aβ has been
confirmed by many other studies in vitro, and it is now well established
that it occurs with monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar forms of
Aβ40 and Aβ42, with a higher affinity
for oligomeric and fibrillar forms relative to monomers in solution
state.5−9 Similarly, the inhibition of Aβ aggregation by TTR, resulting
from such an interaction, has also been confirmed by many other studies
in vitro,6−8,10 with consequent suppression
of the toxic effects of Aβ.6,8,9,11 In addition to inhibiting
Aβ fibril formation, TTR has also been shown to bind to preformed
Aβ40 and Aβ42 oligomers and preformed
Aβ40 fibrils and reduce their toxicity when added
to the extracellular medium of murine primary neurons and of human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, or when injected into the hippocampi
of mice, indicating a multiplicity of mechanisms through which TTR
can be beneficial against the adverse effects of Aβ.11−13 Observations of the ability of TTR to inhibit aggregation and toxicity
of Aβ have also been obtained in animal models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans transgenic for human Aβ42 and TTR14 and mice transgenic
for mutant forms of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) and
having different levels of endogenous TTR or human TTR.15

The involvement of TTR in human AD is
suggested by the concomitant
decrease of both Aβ42 and TTR levels in the CSF of
AD patients16−18 and of their accumulation and colocalization in similar
areas of the cortex and hippocampus in both human AD patients and
transgenic mice.11,19 Moreover, the expression of TTR
in neurons is responsive to the expression of Aβ in both adult
transgenic mice and cultured primary neurons from such mice, well
before plaque formation or signs of neurodegeneration are detectable
to any significant extent.11,20 The concentration of
TTR in the CSF was also found to increase with aging in humans in
the absence of dementia,16 suggesting that
controlled expression of this protein is a response to the increasing
age-dependent failure of protein homeostasis. Indeed, the recent observation
that TTR expression can be induced in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells, primary hippocampal neurons from APP23 mice, and adult APP23
hippocampi (but not mouse liver or cultured hepatoma cells), following
the activation of the heat shock response, is supportive of the hypothesis
that TTR plays a key role in maintaining neuronal protein homeostasis
and hence in protecting against neurodegeneration.21

Despite intensive research, the exact mechanism by
which TTR modulates
the behavior of Aβ and, in particular, affects the microscopic
steps in the complex process of conversion of monomeric Aβ into
amyloid fibrils is still not known in detail. It is also unclear if
the tetrameric and monomeric forms of TTR undergo conformational changes
when binding to Aβ. In this work, we have investigated the unseeded
and seeded formations of Aβ40 fibrils in the presence
of a variety of concentrations of both WT-TTR and M-TTR to establish
which microscopic steps of the process of fibril formation are affected
by TTR, and have also determined the conformational changes occurring
in TTR during these events, as well as those associated with its interaction
with preformed toxic oligomers of Aβ42.

### Materials and Methods

The pMMHa plasmid containing the WT-TTR
or M-TTR gene was transformed
into competent BL21 DE3 Epicurian Gold cells (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). The M-TTR gene was previously obtained by introducing
two mutations at the dimer–dimer interface (F87M and L110M)
in the Hu-TTR plasmid DNA by site-directed mutagenesis.22 Moreover, a mutant protein named W79F-M-TTR
was produced by site-directed mutagenesis starting from the DNA plasmid
of M-TTR using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequences were checked with
DNA sequencing.

All TTR variants were isolated and purified
following previously described procedures.23 In brief, the initial culture of Escherichia coli cells containing the plasmid was grown until cell growth was visible
before inoculating 15 mL of the culture into 1.5 L of LB media with
100 μg mL–1 of ampicillin in 2.8 L Fernbach
flasks. The cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until
OD600 = 1.0–1.2; they were then induced with 1 mM
isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) overnight at 37
°C with vigorous shaking. They were then harvested by centrifugation
at 21 000g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended
in 100 mL L–1 of culture of TBS (20 mM Tris, 0.5
M NaCl, pH 7.5 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and then sonicated in a cold
room or ice bath (3 cycles, 3 min each, with 3 s pulses, 100 amplitude,
1 min resting between cycles). Pellet cell debris was collected by
centrifugation at 12 000g for 15 min at 4
°C, and the resuspended ammonium sulfate pellet was desalted
by dialysis against 2 L of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 24
h using membranes with a 4 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO). The
resulting solutions were chromatographed on an ionic exchange, HR-Q
column (23 mL) using buffer A (25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and
buffer B (25 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with the gradient
starting from 0% buffer B, changing to 20% buffer B in 1 CV, going
to 35% buffer B in 9 CV, keeping 35% buffer B for 1/2 CV, and then
going to 100% buffer B in 2 CV. TTR samples were collected from 21%
buffer B to 35% buffer B and concentrated down to ∼20 mL using
an ultrafilter and a 10 kDa MWCO membrane and were further purified
by gel filtration by employing a Superdex 75 gel filtration column
(GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1 and eluted in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH
7.6, 4 °C. The center of the absorbance peak was collected. The
purification yield was usually ∼10–30 mg L–1 of LB culture. Purified proteins were stored at −20 °C
in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Purified proteins were checked
with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry,
and their purity was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to be >95% in all cases. Protein
concentrations
were determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 18 450 M–1 cm–1 for
M-TTR, ε280 = 77 600 M–1 cm–1 for WT-TTR, and ε280 = 12 950
M–1 cm–1 for W79F-M-TTR.

Aβ40 was expressed in the E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) strain (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) and purified as described previously24 with slight modifications. Briefly, the purification procedure
involved sonication of E. coli cells,
dissolution of inclusion bodies in 8 M urea, and ion exchange in batch
mode on diethylaminoethyl cellulose resin followed by lyophilization.
The lyophilized powder was dissolved, further purified using a Superdex
75 HR 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, U.K.), and the
fractions collected were analyzed using SDS-PAGE for the presence
of the desired peptide product. The fractions with the peptide were
combined, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized again. The
Aβ40 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
using ε280 = 1490 M–1 cm–1.

Aβ42 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
U.K.). The lyophilized powder was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP), which was then evaporated with a nitrogen flow; the powder
was then dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and reached final
volume by the addition of the desired buffer. Finally, the protein
was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Protein concentration was determined
using ε280 = 1490 mol–1 cm–1. Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands
(ADDLs) were prepared by incubating Aβ42 for 24 h,
as previously described.25 For the circular
dichroism (CD) analysis, the samples containing ADDLs were dialyzed
overnight against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
4 °C, with 3 kDa MWCO membranes.

WT-TTR, M-TTR, and Aβ40 samples were
prepared at a final protein concentration of
15 μM in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C.
Before the measurements, the protein samples were filtered with 20
nm cutoff Anotop filters (Whatman, Little Chalfont, U.K.). DLS measurements
were performed using a Zetasizer Nano S device from Malvern Instruments
(Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.) thermostated with a Peltier system.
Low-volume 10 × 4 mm2 disposable cells were used,
and the values of refractive index and viscosity set on the instrument
were determined using the software provided with the instrument, based
on the information of buffer and temperature provided by the user.
All size distributions were the average of three consecutive measurements.

Solutions of monomeric Aβ40 were prepared by dissolving
the lyophilized peptide in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl).
Monomeric forms were purified from potential oligomeric species and
salt using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow
rate of 0.5 mL min–1 and were eluted in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The center of the peak was collected,
and the peptide concentration was determined from the absorbance of
the integrated peak area using ε280 = 1490 M–1 cm–1.

The Aβ40 samples were diluted to final concentrations of 1–5 μM
with 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, under
quiescent conditions, and supplemented with a small volume from a
2 mM thioflavin T (ThT) stock solution in water to reach a final ThT
concentration of 20 μM. WT-TTR and M-TTR were added to final
monomer equivalents (m.e.) ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 relative to Aβ40. All samples were prepared in low-binding Eppendorf tubes
on ice using careful pipetting to avoid introduction of air bubbles.
Each sample was then pipetted into multiple wells of a 96-well half-area,
low-binding, clear bottom, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated
plate (Corning 3881) to give 80 μL per well (three repeats per
sample). The 96-well plate was placed at 37 °C under quiescent
conditions in a plate reader (Fluostar Omega, Fluostar Optima, or
Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The ThT fluorescence
was measured in real time for all of the wells concomitantly through
the bottom of the plate with a 440 nm excitation filter and a 480
nm emission filter. The time course (or kinetic trace, ThT fluorescence
versus time) of aggregation was then obtained for each well.

Amyloid fibril formation was analyzed using a kinetic
model containing the microscopic steps of primary nucleation and fibril
elongation and a multistep secondary nucleation, the mechanism of
aggregation of Aβ40, as previously described26,2712where [P] and [M] are the number and mass
concentrations of aggregates, respectively; kn, k2, and k+ are the rate constants for primary nucleation,
secondary nucleation, and fibril elongation, respectively; [m] is
the concentration of monomers; KM is the
Michaelis constant; and nc and n2 are the reaction orders relative to the monomer
of primary and secondary nucleations, respectively.

All kinetic
traces of aggregation obtained at different Aβ40 concentrations
were first normalized to fibrillar mass concentration, dividing the
ThT fluorescence values at time t ([M]t) by the corresponding values measured at the plateau
([M]∞), taken as 1.0 or 100%. The resulting traces
were analyzed simultaneously with a procedure of global best fitting
using the fitting platform amylofit,26−28 which employs an integrated
rate law obtained from the above equations, as previously described26−283where
the definitions of the parameters are456789and where [m]0 is the initial monomer
concentration; [P]0, [M]0 and [P]∞, [M]∞ are the aggregate number and mass concentration
at the beginning and end of aggregation, respectively; k+, kn, and k2 are the rate constants of elongation, primary,
and secondary nucleations, respectively; nc and n2 are the reaction orders relative
to the monomer of primary and secondary nucleations, respectively;
and KM is the Michaelis constant; other
details were as reported previously.27 The
dependence of the aggregation half-time (t1/2) on [m]0 can be expressed as a simple scaling law t1/2 ∼ ([m]0)γ, with the scaling exponent γ. For the above model, γ
is given by2710where γ
= −n2 + 1/2 at low monomer concentrations
and γ = −1/2
at high monomer concentrations.26,27,29

The global fitting procedure was first performed using the
kinetic
traces of Aβ40 at different concentrations in the
absence of the TTR species to obtain the mean values and errors for KM, k+kn, and k+k2 that best describe all kinetic traces.
It was then repeated on the kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0
μM Aβ40 and the TTR species at different concentrations
to identify the microscopic steps inhibited by each TTR form. This
was achieved by allowing one of the microscopic rate constants kn, k2, or k+ to vary between data sets recorded
at different inhibitor concentrations and forcing the other parameters
to be global, i.e., take the same value for all data sets, as outlined
in detail.28 It was then repeated on the
kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0 μM Aβ40, 25% Aβ40 seeds, and TTRs at different concentrations
to assess whether the TTR species affected the fibril elongation process.
It was finally repeated on the kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0
μM Aβ40, 2% Aβ40 seeds, and
TTRs at different concentrations to assess whether the TTR species
affected the secondary nucleation process. This was achieved by comparing
the k2 values required to describe the
aggregation kinetics, in both the absence and presence of the TTR
species. Finally, to assess the consistency of our conclusions from
both the unseeded and lightly seeded experiments, the data at 5.0
μM Aβ40 in both the absence and presence of
2% Aβ40 seeds, and in the absence and presence of
0.1 m.e. of either M-TTR or WT-TTR, were fitted together. The rate
constants kn and k2 were both allowed to vary (while k+ was kept constant) but forced to take the same value
for both the unseeded and the seeded data.

High-resolution
and phase-controlled AFM was performed on positively functionalized
mica (TedPella Inc.) substrates.30 The
mica surface was cleaved and incubated for 1 min with 10 μL
of 0.5% (v/v) (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) in Milli-Q water. Then, the substrate was rinsed three
times with 1 mL of Milli-Q water and dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen
gas. Aliquots of an Aβ40 sample aggregating at a
concentration of 10 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150
mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C, with or without 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR were
removed from the aggregation reaction at 0, 1, 3, and 4 h of incubation
and were directly deposited onto the functionalized mica surfaces.
The droplets were incubated for 10 min, then rinsed with 1 mL of Milli-Q
water, and dried by the gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The preparation
was carried out at room temperature. AFM maps were realized by means
of a JPK nanowizard2 (Berlin, Germany) system operating in tapping
mode and equipped with a silicon tip (μmasch, 2 N m–1) with a nominal radius of 10 nm. Image flattening was performed
by SPIP (Image Metrology, Hørsholm, Denmark) software.

Each TTR variant was diluted to 0.2 mM in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C. Aliquots of DACM dissolved
in pure DMSO were added to a 10-fold molar excess of dye. Each sample
was wrapped with aluminum foil and incubated under shaking for 1 h
at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 5 μL of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA). The unbound dye was removed by extensive dialysis, using
3 kDa MCWO membranes, and the sample was then centrifuged to remove
any precipitate. The DACM concentration of the resulting labeled protein
sample was determined using ε381 = 27 000
M–1 cm–1. The protein concentration
was measured at 280 nm using the same ε280 values
reported above, after subtraction of the contribution of an equimolar
concentration of DACM-GSH. Only samples with a degree of labeling
close to 100% were used. The absence of free DACM, unlabeled protein,
and multiply labeled protein in the samples, as well as the presence
of singly labeled TTRs, was checked with mass spectrometry, as previously
reported.31

Aliquots of an Aβ40 sample aggregating
at a concentration of 10 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C, were removed from the various aggregation
reactions at different time points and mixed with solutions containing
either DACM-labeled or unlabeled WT-TTR, M-TTR, or W79F-M-TTR. The
final conditions after mixing were 9 μM Aβ40 and 3 μM (0.3 m.e.) DACM-labeled or unlabeled TTR monomer
(in one of its three forms), at molar ratios of 1:3 (TTR/Aβ40) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
37 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra (excitation 290 nm) were
recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter (Waltham, MA)
equipped with a thermostated cell holder attached to a Haake F8 water
bath (Karlsruhe, Germany). A 10 × 2 mm2 quartz cuvette
was used. The FRET efficiency (E) and the associated
distance (R) between Cys10-DACM and Trp41 were determined
as determined previously.31

In another
set of experiments, Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands
(ADDLs) were prepared by incubating Aβ42 for 24 h
as described.25 12 μM Aβ42 ADDLs (m.e.) were co-incubated with 4 μM DACM-labeled
or unlabeled M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR (m.e.) at molar ratios of 1:3 (TTR/Aβ42) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
37 °C. 4 μM DACM-labeled or unlabeled M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR
(m.e.) was also incubated under the same conditions in the absence
of Aβ42 ADDLs. 12 μM Aβ42 ADDLs
(m.e.) were also incubated in the absence of the TTR species. Fluorescence
emission spectra were recorded at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min and analyzed
using the same apparatus, cuvette, and equation as described above.
Proteolytic activity of M-TTR on monomeric Aβ42 was
excluded by incubating the two proteins for 30 min or 4 h before SDS-PAGE
analysis.

Far-UV CD spectra of WT-TTR,
M-TTR, and W79F-M-TTR in the presence of Aβ40 following
a 30 min co-incubation in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25
°C, and of all four proteins incubated for 30 min individually,
were collected from 185 to 250 nm using a J-810 spectropolarimeter
from Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder
attached to a Thermo Haake C25P water bath (Karlsruhe, Germany) and
using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany).
NaCl (150 mM) was not used in this case due to the noise generated
by this salt in the far-UV CD spectra. Total protein concentrations
of 0.1 mg mL–1 were used for both individual proteins
or protein mixtures (TTR-Aβ40); these corresponded
to 23 and 7.3 μM (individual proteins) or 11.2 and 3.7 μM
(protein mixtures at molar ratios of 3:1) for Aβ40 and TTR monomers, respectively. All spectra were blank-subtracted
and converted to mean residue ellipticity ([Θ]). In the case
of protein mixtures, mean residue ellipticity values [Θ] were
calculated as11where Θ is the ellipticity
in mdeg units, l is the path length in cm units and
has a value of 0.1
cm, n1 and n2 are the numbers of residues of TTR and Aβ40, respectively, m1 and m2 are the
molecular masses in Da of TTR and Aβ40, respectively,
and c1 and c2 are the protein concentrations in mg mL–1 of TTR
and Aβ40, respectively. The theoretical average mean
residue ellipticity values ([Θ]avg), assuming that
neither unstructured to structured transitions nor secondary structure
rearrangements occur, were calculated as12where [Θ]1 and [Θ]2 correspond to the measured mean residue ellipticity values, n1 and n2 to the
number of residues of TTR and Aβ40, respectively,
and R to the excess molar ratio of protein.

In another set of experiments, far-UV CD spectra of 4 μM M-TTR
and W79F-M-TTR incubated in the presence of 12 μM (m.e.) Aβ42 ADDLs in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37 °C,
were recorded after 0, 20, 40, and 60 min using a J-810 spectropolarimeter
from Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder
attached to a Thermo Haake C25P water bath (Karlsruhe, Germany) and
using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany).
All spectra were blank-subtracted and converted to mean residue ellipticity
([Θ]).

Fluorescence spectra of M-TTR (excitation
280 nm, emission 300–450
nm) at an initial concentration of 7.2 μM were recorded after
adding increasing volumes of 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl at
37 °C, with or without Aβ42 ADDLs, with final
concentrations of the latter ranging from 0 to 9 μM (m.e.).
A 10 × 4 mm2 quartz cuvette was used with the same
fluorimeter apparatus as that described above. We also acquired fluorescence
spectra of ADDLs alone to confirm the absence of fluorescence. The
ratio between the total emitted fluorescence (300–450 nm) in
the absence (F0) and presence (F) of ADDLs was determined at all ADDL concentrations.

Aβ42 ADDLs
(1.0 mg mL–1) and M-TTR (0.2 mg mL–1) were mixed or kept separated and incubated at 25 °C for 30
min in PBS. Five hundred microliters were then injected into a Superdex
200 Increase 10/300 GL (Ge Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.) and
run with an AKTA-pure 25 L (GE Healthcare), with PBS elution and optical
absorption recording at 280 nm. One milliliter fractions were collected,
precipitated with prechilled acetone, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with
a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN precast protein gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The obtained gel was stained with silver nitrate.

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reduction assay was performed as described previously.13,32 The image acquisition and analysis of caspase-3 activity were also
performed as described previously.13,32

### Expression, Purification, and Site-Directed
Mutagenesis of TTRs

The pMMHa plasmid containing the WT-TTR
or M-TTR gene was transformed
into competent BL21 DE3 Epicurian Gold cells (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). The M-TTR gene was previously obtained by introducing
two mutations at the dimer–dimer interface (F87M and L110M)
in the Hu-TTR plasmid DNA by site-directed mutagenesis.22 Moreover, a mutant protein named W79F-M-TTR
was produced by site-directed mutagenesis starting from the DNA plasmid
of M-TTR using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All DNA sequences were checked with
DNA sequencing.

All TTR variants were isolated and purified
following previously described procedures.23 In brief, the initial culture of Escherichia coli cells containing the plasmid was grown until cell growth was visible
before inoculating 15 mL of the culture into 1.5 L of LB media with
100 μg mL–1 of ampicillin in 2.8 L Fernbach

OD600 = 1.0–1.2; they were then induced with 1 mM
isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) overnight at 37
°C with vigorous shaking. They were then harvested by centrifugation
at 21 000g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended
in 100 mL L–1 of culture of TBS (20 mM Tris, 0.5
M NaCl, pH 7.5 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)), and then sonicated in a cold
room or ice bath (3 cycles, 3 min each, with 3 s pulses, 100 amplitude,
1 min resting between cycles). Pellet cell debris was collected by
centrifugation at 12 000g for 15 min at 4
°C, and the resuspended ammonium sulfate pellet was desalted
by dialysis against 2 L of 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 24

to 35% buffer B in 9 CV, keeping 35% buffer B for 1/2 CV, and then
going to 100% buffer B in 2 CV. TTR samples were collected from 21%
buffer B to 35% buffer B and concentrated down to ∼20 mL using
an ultrafilter and a 10 kDa MWCO membrane and were further purified
by gel filtration by employing a Superdex 75 gel filtration column
(GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min–1 and eluted in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH
7.6, 4 °C. The center of the absorbance peak was collected. The
purification yield was usually ∼10–30 mg L–1 of LB culture. Purified proteins were stored at −20 °C
in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Purified proteins were checked
with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry,
and their purity was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to be >95% in all cases. Protein
concentrations
were determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 18 450 M–1 cm–1 for
M-TTR, ε280 = 77 600 M–1 cm–1 for WT-TTR, and ε280 = 12 950
M–1 cm–1 for W79F-M-TTR.

Aβ40 was expressed in the E. coli BL21 Gold (DE3) strain (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) and purified as described previously24 with slight modifications. Briefly, the purification procedure
involved sonication of E. coli cells,
dissolution of inclusion bodies in 8 M urea, and ion exchange in batch
mode on diethylaminoethyl cellulose resin followed by lyophilization.
The lyophilized powder was dissolved, further purified using a Superdex
75 HR 26/60 column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, U.K.), and the
fractions collected were analyzed using SDS-PAGE for the presence
of the desired peptide product. The fractions with the peptide were
combined, frozen using liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized again. The
Aβ40 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
using ε280 = 1490 M–1 cm–1.

Aβ42 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
U.K.). The lyophilized powder was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP), which was then evaporated with a nitrogen flow; the powder
was then dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and reached final
volume by the addition of the desired buffer. Finally, the protein
was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Protein concentration was determined
using ε280 = 1490 mol–1 cm–1. Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands
(ADDLs) were prepared by incubating Aβ42 for 24 h,
as previously described.25 For the circular
dichroism (CD) analysis, the samples containing ADDLs were dialyzed
overnight against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
4 °C, with 3 kDa MWCO membranes.

### Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)

WT-TTR, M-TTR, and Aβ40 samples were
prepared at a final protein concentration of
15 μM in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C.
Before the measurements, the protein samples were filtered with 20
nm cutoff Anotop filters (Whatman, Little Chalfont, U.K.). DLS measurements
were performed using a Zetasizer Nano S device from Malvern Instruments
(Malvern, Worcestershire, U.K.) thermostated with a Peltier system.
Low-volume 10 × 4 mm2 disposable cells were used,
and the values of refractive index and viscosity set on the instrument
were determined using the software provided with the instrument, based
on the information of buffer and temperature provided by the user.
All size distributions were the average of three consecutive measurements.

### Time Course of Aβ40 Amyloid Fibril Formation

Solutions of monomeric Aβ40 were prepared by dissolving
the lyophilized peptide in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl).
Monomeric forms were purified from potential oligomeric species and
salt using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at a flow
rate of 0.5 mL min–1 and were eluted in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The center of the peak was collected,
and the peptide concentration was determined from the absorbance of
the integrated peak area using ε280 = 1490 M–1 cm–1.

The Aβ40 samples were diluted to final concentrations of 1–5 μM
with 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, under
quiescent conditions, and supplemented with a small volume from a
2 mM thioflavin T (ThT) stock solution in water to reach a final ThT
concentration of 20 μM. WT-TTR and M-TTR were added to final
monomer equivalents (m.e.) ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 relative to Aβ40. All samples were prepared in low-binding Eppendorf tubes
on ice using careful pipetting to avoid introduction of air bubbles.
Each sample was then pipetted into multiple wells of a 96-well half-area,
low-binding, clear bottom, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated
plate (Corning 3881) to give 80 μL per well (three repeats per
sample). The 96-well plate was placed at 37 °C under quiescent
conditions in a plate reader (Fluostar Omega, Fluostar Optima, or
Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The ThT fluorescence
was measured in real time for all of the wells concomitantly through
the bottom of the plate with a 440 nm excitation filter and a 480
nm emission filter. The time course (or kinetic trace, ThT fluorescence
versus time) of aggregation was then obtained for each well.

### Chemical
Kinetics Model of Aβ40 Amyloid Fibril
Formation

Amyloid fibril formation was analyzed using a kinetic
model containing the microscopic steps of primary nucleation and fibril
elongation and a multistep secondary nucleation, the mechanism of
aggregation of Aβ40, as previously described26,2712where [P] and [M] are the number and mass
concentrations of aggregates, respectively; kn, k2, and k+ are the rate constants for primary nucleation,
secondary nucleation, and fibril elongation, respectively; [m] is
the concentration of monomers; KM is the
Michaelis constant; and nc and n2 are the reaction orders relative to the monomer
of primary and secondary nucleations, respectively.

All kinetic
traces of aggregation obtained at different Aβ40 concentrations
were first normalized to fibrillar mass concentration, dividing the
ThT fluorescence values at time t ([M]t) by the corresponding values measured at the plateau
([M]∞), taken as 1.0 or 100%. The resulting traces
were analyzed simultaneously with a procedure of global best fitting
using the fitting platform amylofit,26−28 which employs an integrated
rate law obtained from the above equations, as previously described26−283where
the definitions of the parameters are456789and where [m]0 is the initial monomer
concentration; [P]0, [M]0 and [P]∞, [M]∞ are the aggregate number and mass concentration
at the beginning and end of aggregation, respectively; k+, kn, and k2 are the rate constants of elongation, primary,
and secondary nucleations, respectively; nc and n2 are the reaction orders relative
to the monomer of primary and secondary nucleations, respectively;
and KM is the Michaelis constant; other
details were as reported previously.27 The
dependence of the aggregation half-time (t1/2) on [m]0 can be expressed as a simple scaling law t1/2 ∼ ([m]0)γ, with the scaling exponent γ. For the above model, γ
is given by2710where γ
= −n2 + 1/2 at low monomer concentrations
and γ = −1/2
at high monomer concentrations.26,27,29

The global fitting procedure was first performed using the
kinetic
traces of Aβ40 at different concentrations in the
absence of the TTR species to obtain the mean values and errors for KM, k+kn, and k+k2 that best describe all kinetic traces.
It was then repeated on the kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0
μM Aβ40 and the TTR species at different concentrations
to identify the microscopic steps inhibited by each TTR form. This
was achieved by allowing one of the microscopic rate constants kn, k2, or k+ to vary between data sets recorded
at different inhibitor concentrations and forcing the other parameters
to be global, i.e., take the same value for all data sets, as outlined
in detail.28 It was then repeated on the
kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0 μM Aβ40, 25% Aβ40 seeds, and TTRs at different concentrations
to assess whether the TTR species affected the fibril elongation process.
It was finally repeated on the kinetic traces in the presence of 5.0
μM Aβ40, 2% Aβ40 seeds, and
TTRs at different concentrations to assess whether the TTR species
affected the secondary nucleation process. This was achieved by comparing
the k2 values required to describe the
aggregation kinetics, in both the absence and presence of the TTR
species. Finally, to assess the consistency of our conclusions from
both the unseeded and lightly seeded experiments, the data at 5.0
μM Aβ40 in both the absence and presence of
2% Aβ40 seeds, and in the absence and presence of
0.1 m.e. of either M-TTR or WT-TTR, were fitted together. The rate
constants kn and k2 were both allowed to vary (while k+ was kept constant) but forced to take the same value
for both the unseeded and the seeded data.

### Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM) Imaging

High-resolution
and phase-controlled AFM was performed on positively functionalized
mica (TedPella Inc.) substrates.30 The
mica surface was cleaved and incubated for 1 min with 10 μL
of 0.5% (v/v) (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) in Milli-Q water. Then, the substrate was rinsed three
times with 1 mL of Milli-Q water and dried by a gentle stream of nitrogen
gas. Aliquots of an Aβ40 sample aggregating at a
concentration of 10 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150
mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C, with or without 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR were
removed from the aggregation reaction at 0, 1, 3, and 4 h of incubation
and were directly deposited onto the functionalized mica surfaces.
The droplets were incubated for 10 min, then rinsed with 1 mL of Milli-Q
water, and dried by the gentle stream of nitrogen gas. The preparation
was carried out at room temperature. AFM maps were realized by means
of a JPK nanowizard2 (Berlin, Germany) system operating in tapping
mode and equipped with a silicon tip (μmasch, 2 N m–1) with a nominal radius of 10 nm. Image flattening was performed
by SPIP (Image Metrology, Hørsholm, Denmark) software.

### Labeling
of TTRs with N-(7-Dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)maleimide
(DACM)

Each TTR variant was diluted to 0.2 mM in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C. Aliquots of DACM dissolved
in pure DMSO were added to a 10-fold molar excess of dye. Each sample
was wrapped with aluminum foil and incubated under shaking for 1 h
at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched with 5 μL of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA). The unbound dye was removed by extensive dialysis, using
3 kDa MCWO membranes, and the sample was then centrifuged to remove
any precipitate. The DACM concentration of the resulting labeled protein
sample was determined using ε381 = 27 000
M–1 cm–1. The protein concentration
was measured at 280 nm using the same ε280 values
reported above, after subtraction of the contribution of an equimolar
concentration of DACM-GSH. Only samples with a degree of labeling
close to 100% were used. The absence of free DACM, unlabeled protein,
and multiply labeled protein in the samples, as well as the presence
of singly labeled TTRs, was checked with mass spectrometry, as previously
reported.31

### Intrinsic Fluorescence
and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer
(FRET)

Aliquots of an Aβ40 sample aggregating
at a concentration of 10 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C, were removed from the various aggregation
reactions at different time points and mixed with solutions containing
either DACM-labeled or unlabeled WT-TTR, M-TTR, or W79F-M-TTR. The
final conditions after mixing were 9 μM Aβ40 and 3 μM (0.3 m.e.) DACM-labeled or unlabeled TTR monomer
(in one of its three forms), at molar ratios of 1:3 (TTR/Aβ40) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
37 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra (excitation 290 nm) were
recorded using a PerkinElmer LS 55 spectrofluorimeter (Waltham, MA)
equipped with a thermostated cell holder attached to a Haake F8 water
bath (Karlsruhe, Germany). A 10 × 2 mm2 quartz cuvette
was used. The FRET efficiency (E) and the associated
distance (R) between Cys10-DACM and Trp41 were determined
as determined previously.31

In another
set of experiments, Aβ42-derived diffusible ligands
(ADDLs) were prepared by incubating Aβ42 for 24 h
as described.25 12 μM Aβ42 ADDLs (m.e.) were co-incubated with 4 μM DACM-labeled
or unlabeled M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR (m.e.) at molar ratios of 1:3 (TTR/Aβ42) in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
37 °C. 4 μM DACM-labeled or unlabeled M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR
(m.e.) was also incubated under the same conditions in the absence
of Aβ42 ADDLs. 12 μM Aβ42 ADDLs
(m.e.) were also incubated in the absence of the TTR species. Fluorescence
emission spectra were recorded at 0, 20, 40, and 60 min and analyzed
using the same apparatus, cuvette, and equation as described above.
Proteolytic activity of M-TTR on monomeric Aβ42 was
excluded by incubating the two proteins for 30 min or 4 h before SDS-PAGE
analysis.

### Far-UV CD Spectroscopy

Far-UV CD spectra of WT-TTR,
M-TTR, and W79F-M-TTR in the presence of Aβ40 following
a 30 min co-incubation in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25
°C, and of all four proteins incubated for 30 min individually,
were collected from 185 to 250 nm using a J-810 spectropolarimeter
from Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder
attached to a Thermo Haake C25P water bath (Karlsruhe, Germany) and
using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany).
NaCl (150 mM) was not used in this case due to the noise generated
by this salt in the far-UV CD spectra. Total protein concentrations
of 0.1 mg mL–1 were used for both individual proteins
or protein mixtures (TTR-Aβ40); these corresponded
to 23 and 7.3 μM (individual proteins) or 11.2 and 3.7 μM
(protein mixtures at molar ratios of 3:1) for Aβ40 and TTR monomers, respectively. All spectra were blank-subtracted
and converted to mean residue ellipticity ([Θ]). In the case
of protein mixtures, mean residue ellipticity values [Θ] were
calculated as11where Θ is the ellipticity
in mdeg units, l is the path length in cm units and
has a value of 0.1
cm, n1 and n2 are the numbers of residues of TTR and Aβ40, respectively, m1 and m2 are the
molecular masses in Da of TTR and Aβ40, respectively,
and c1 and c2 are the protein concentrations in mg mL–1 of TTR
and Aβ40, respectively. The theoretical average mean
residue ellipticity values ([Θ]avg), assuming that
neither unstructured to structured transitions nor secondary structure
rearrangements occur, were calculated as12where [Θ]1 and [Θ]2 correspond to the measured mean residue ellipticity values, n1 and n2 to the
number of residues of TTR and Aβ40, respectively,
and R to the excess molar ratio of protein.

In another set of experiments, far-UV CD spectra of 4 μM M-TTR
and W79F-M-TTR incubated in the presence of 12 μM (m.e.) Aβ42 ADDLs in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37 °C,
were recorded after 0, 20, 40, and 60 min using a J-810 spectropolarimeter
from Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermostated cell holder
attached to a Thermo Haake C25P water bath (Karlsruhe, Germany) and
using a 0.1 cm path length cuvette (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany).
All spectra were blank-subtracted and converted to mean residue ellipticity
([Θ]).

### Fluorescence Quenching of M -TTR by Aβ42 ADDLs

Fluorescence spectra of M-TTR (excitation
280 nm, emission 300–450
nm) at an initial concentration of 7.2 μM were recorded after
adding increasing volumes of 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl at
37 °C, with or without Aβ42 ADDLs, with final
concentrations of the latter ranging from 0 to 9 μM (m.e.).
A 10 × 4 mm2 quartz cuvette was used with the same
fluorimeter apparatus as that described above. We also acquired fluorescence
spectra of ADDLs alone to confirm the absence of fluorescence. The
ratio between the total emitted fluorescence (300–450 nm) in
the absence (F0) and presence (F) of ADDLs was determined at all ADDL concentrations.

### Size Exclusion Chromatography

Aβ42 ADDLs
(1.0 mg mL–1) and M-TTR (0.2 mg mL–1) were mixed or kept separated and incubated at 25 °C for 30
min in PBS. Five hundred microliters were then injected into a Superdex
200 Increase 10/300 GL (Ge Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.) and
run with an AKTA-pure 25 L (GE Healthcare), with PBS elution and optical
absorption recording at 280 nm. One milliliter fractions were collected,
precipitated with prechilled acetone, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with
a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN precast protein gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The obtained gel was stained with silver nitrate.

### Cell Toxicity
Assays

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reduction assay was performed as described previously.13,32 The image acquisition and analysis of caspase-3 activity were also
performed as described previously.13,32

### Results

Samples of Aβ40, WT-TTR,
and M-TTR were generated as described in Materials
and Methods, and analysis with SDS-PAGE showed that the proteins
were electrophoretically pure. An initial preliminary analysis was
carried out with dynamic light scattering (DLS) to rule out the possibility
that any of the three purified proteins had aggregated prior to the
analysis. The Aβ40 peptide was found to have an apparent
hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of 3.0 ±
0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), in agreement with previously reported values33 and with the expectations originating from general polymer
scaling arguments for a monomeric unfolded 40-residue long peptide,
i.e., 3.5 ± 0.734 or 3.6 ± 1.7
nm.35 M-TTR was found to have a Dh value of 4.2 ± 0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), in good agreement with values previously
determined experimentally22,36,37 and with the value theoretically expected for a monomeric 127-residue
globular protein, i.e., 3.9 ± 0.9 nm.35 WT-TTR was found to have a Dh value
of 6.2 ± 0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), which is in good agreement with that expected
for the folded tetrameric state, as calculated from geometric laws.

We then monitored
the aggregation of Aβ40 at various concentrations
in a buffer close to physiological conditions and probed the progress
of the aggregation reaction using ThT fluorescence at 480 nm (excitation
440 nm). Specifically, Aβ40 was incubated at a series
of concentrations between 1.0 and 5.0 μM in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM ThT, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, under
quiescent conditions. The ThT fluorescence values of the resulting
samples were measured at regular time intervals and plotted as a function
of time (Figure 1a).
In previous work, ThT was not found to significantly affect the rate
of fibril formation of Aβ40.27 In all cases, the time courses followed a characteristic sigmoidal
profile with lag, exponential, and plateau phases. The length of the
lag phase was found to decrease with the Aβ40 concentration,
and the steepness of the exponential phase increased, as well as the
final ThT fluorescence measured at the plateau, which is proportional
to the peptide concentration to a good approximation (Figure 1a).38 Three samples were prepared for each Aβ40 concentration,
and the resulting kinetic traces were found to show little variation
(Figure 1a).

Secondary nucleation
step in Aβ40 aggregation
is kinetically saturated. (a) Time courses of amyloid fibril formation
at the indicated Aβ40 concentrations, (b) half-time
of Aβ40 aggregation versus the initial monomer concentration,
as derived from (a). The solid line is the theoretical prediction
of the half-time using eq 10. Error bars are standard deviations (s.d.). (c) Normalized
time courses as derived from (a). The solid lines show predictions
for the resulting reaction profiles using a kinetic model containing
the microscopic steps of primary nucleation and fibril elongation
and a multistep secondary nucleation (eq 3) with fixed reaction orders of nc = n2 = 2.27

To interpret quantitatively these
time courses, we considered first
the half-time of the fibril mass formation as a function of the initial
monomer concentration, which yields the exponent γ that informs
on the dominant nucleation mechanisms active in a given system.27 In the case of Aβ40 aggregation,
it has been found to vary from −1.2 at low Aβ40 concentrations to −0.2 at high Aβ40 concentrations.27 This is due to the fact that at low monomer
concentrations, where γ is highly negative, rates of secondary
nucleation are predominantly determined by the attachment of free
monomers to the surface of the fibrils, and thus the rates depend
strongly on the monomer concentration. Instead, at high monomer concentrations,
where γ is lower, secondary nucleation is saturated, as secondary
nucleation sites are fully occupied by monomers. Under these conditions,
the rate of nucleation is no longer dependent on the concentration
of free monomers but is governed by the rate of conversion and detachment
of the bound monomers on the fibril surface.27 Interestingly, the data in Figure 1b show an exponent γ above −1.0 (less
negative), at all monomer concentrations, indicating that secondary
nucleation is likely to have approached saturation under the conditions
explored here. This saturation at lower concentrations than those
observed previously is likely a result of the increased ionic strength
under the conditions used here. As established previously, an increase
in ionic strength promotes the attachment step during the secondary
nucleation of Aβ and thus leads to saturation at lower concentrations.39

We next proceeded to assess if all kinetic
traces could be quantitatively
reproduced from a molecular model in which saturated secondary nucleation
is the mechanism dominating the kinetics of aggregation, as suggested
by the scaling analysis discussed above. To this effect, all of the
kinetic traces were first normalized to the same fibrillar mass concentration
by dividing the ThT fluorescence intensity at time t ([M]t) by the corresponding values measured
at the plateau ([M]∞), taken as 1.0 or 100% (Figure 1c). Oligomer concentrations
were found to be small compared to monomer and fibrillar concentrations
and thus do not need to be considered explicitly in this normalization.40 The resulting time courses of [M]t/[M]∞ at different Aβ40 concentrations were then analyzed simultaneously by generating
the best fits to the experimental data using a single rate law (eq 3) that was derived from
a model that includes the specific microscopic steps of primary nucleation,
fibril elongation, and a saturated secondary nucleation process (eqs 1 and 2), as described previously27 and in Materials and Methods (Figure 1c). From the fitting of the model, we also
found that the concentration at which secondary nucleation has reached
half-saturation (Km1/2) was
below the range of Aβ40 concentrations studied here
(1–5 μM), in agreement with the idea that the saturation
of the secondary nucleation pathway is expected at the measured monomer
concentrations.

The time courses of amyloid
fibril formation by 5.0 μM Aβ40 were studied
under the same solution conditions in the absence and presence of
tetrameric WT-TTR and monomeric M-TTR at different concentrations,
ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 molar equivalents (m.e.) of monomeric TTR
subunits (Figure 2a–f).
All concentrations of TTR molecules reported here refer to concentrations
of monomeric TTR subunits. The fibril formation kinetics of a 5.0
μM sample of Aβ40 were found to be significantly
slowed down in the presence of either TTR variant, but the comparison
of kinetic traces at similar m.e. shows that WT-TTR has a more effective
inhibitory effect. When the two forms of TTR studied here were incubated
under the same experimental conditions in the absence of Aβ40, the ThT fluorescence was not found to increase with time,
even with very high concentrations of M-TTR and WT-TTR (Figure 2g).

WT-TTR and M-TTR display
strong inhibition of primary nucleation
in Aβ40 aggregation. (a–f) Time courses of
fibril formation by 5.0 μM Aβ40 in the presence
of WT-TTR (a–c) and M-TTR (d–f) at the indicated concentrations
(m.e.). The solid lines are fits of the kinetic profiles by a model
in which secondary nucleation (a, d), elongation (b, e), or primary
nucleation (c, f) is inhibited by TTRs. (g) Incubation of 20, 30,
and 50 μM WT-TTR and M-TTR under the same conditions in the
absence of Aβ40. (h) Change in the effective rate
constants of primary nucleation in Aβ40 aggregation,
as derived from (e) and (f), shown with increasing concentrations
of WT-TTR (green) and M-TTR (black). Error bars are s.d. of the rates
obtained from individual fitting of the repeats. The traces in (a)–(f)
show the average traces of those repeats.

We then carried out a quantitative analysis of the effects of the
two different TTR species by fitting the rate law determined in the
absence of TTR but allowing some of the rates to vary (see Materials and Methods).26,41 The kinetic aggregation traces in Figure 2a–f could be fitted to the moment
equation after introducing suitable perturbations to single rate constants
describing individual microscopic processes (eq 3). This approach thereby indicated which specific
microscopic steps were affected by the presence of the TTR species
and showed that the unseeded aggregation kinetics of Aβ40 in the presence of a range of M-TTR or WT-TTR concentrations
investigated here are very well described when the primary nucleation
rate constant (kn) is
specifically decreased (Figure 2c,f). By contrast, the experimental data are not consistent
with predictions made by altering the rate constants of secondary
nucleation (k2) or elongation (k+) (Figure 2a,b,d,e).

This analysis reveals that in the presence
of M-TTR or WT-TTR,
the primary nucleation pathway, which is governed by the product of
the rate constants of elongation and primary nucleation (k+kn), is
specifically perturbed. In particular, the k+kn value in the
presence of the TTR species (k+knapp) was found
to decrease by a factor of approximately 10 and 106 with
0.1 m.e. of WT-TTR and M-TTR, respectively, relative to that in the
absence of TTRs (k+kn) (Figure 2h and Supporting Information, Table S1). Hence, the analysis indicates that the inhibitory effects
of WT-TTR and M-TTR on unseeded Aβ40 aggregation
originate largely from the modulation of a single key microscopic
step, i.e., primary nucleation.

The analysis described so far identified
primary nucleation as the most strongly affected kinetic quantity.
To probe whether there was also a small effect on elongation rate
(k+) that was not visible in the unseeded
data due to the strong effect on primary nucleation, we recorded time
courses of Aβ40 fibril formation under the same conditions,
but in the presence of large quantities of preformed fibrils of Aβ40, corresponding to 25% of soluble Aβ40 in
m.e. and in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m.e. of WT-TTR and M-TTR (Figure 3a). With 25% of preformed
fibrils, the primary and secondary nucleation steps are effectively
bypassed, the overall number of aggregates remains approximately constant
in time, and the dominant mechanism responsible for the consumption
of monomeric Aβ40 is the elongation of the preformed
fibrils.40,42 In the absence of TTR, amyloid fibril formation
by Aβ40 was very rapid and without a detectable lag
phase, as expected due to the presence of seed fibrils (Figure 3a). Neither 0.2 nor 0.4 m.e.
of WT-TTR and M-TTR was found to affect significantly the aggregation
kinetics (Figure 3a,b),
revealing that Aβ40 fibril elongation is not affected
by the presence of either TTR form.

WT-TTR and M-TTR cause significant inhibition
of secondary nucleation,
but not elongation, in Aβ40 aggregation. (a) Kinetic

when elongation (k+) is allowed to vary
by the different TTR species. (b) Normalized rate constants for fibril
elongation derived from the fitted curves in (a). Error bars are s.d.

or 0.2 m.e. of M-TTR or WT-TTR. Solid lines represent predictions
for the resulting reaction profiles when secondary nucleation (k2) is allowed to vary by the different TTR species.
(d) Normalized rate constants for secondary nucleation derived from
the fitted curves in (c). Error bars are s.d. (e) Scheme of the proposed
protective mechanisms operated by WT-TTR and M-TTR on Aβ fibril
formation and its toxicity. Top: microscopic processes of amyloid
fibril formation and associated rate constants slowed down by WT-TTR
and M-TTR (red crosses). Bottom right: binding of TTR molecules to
Aβ oligomers and inhibition of their toxicity.

To probe whether there was also an
effect on secondary nucleation rate constant (k2) in the presence of the two forms of TTR that was not visible
in the unseeded data due to the strong effect on primary nucleation,
we repeated the experiments described above in the presence of smaller
quantities of preformed fibrils of Aβ40 (2% m.e.).
At this concentration of fibril seeds, primary nucleation is bypassed,
but both fibril elongation and surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation
contribute significantly to the overall kinetics of fibril formation.42−45 In the absence of either form of TTR, the entire process of Aβ40 fibril formation was found to have an intermediate rate
relative to the corresponding processes in the absence and presence
of 25% seeds, with a short lag phase still detectable (Figure 3c). In the presence of 0.1
and 0.2 m.e. of M-TTR and WT-TTR, the fibril formation process was
significantly slowed down in a concentration-dependent manner, with
the efficiency of inhibition being higher for WT-TTR than for M-TTR
(Figure 3c,d). Since
neither M-TTR nor WT-TTR affects Aβ40 fibril elongation
at these concentrations (Figure 3a,b), and the primary nucleation step is bypassed with
2% fibrillar seeds, this retardation can be attributed to a decrease
in the rate constant of secondary nucleation (k2). Indeed, the experimental time courses are well described
when only k2 is varied in the presence
of increasing concentrations of M-TTR and WT-TTR (Figure 3c,d). The k2 values were found to be decreased by ca. 32 and 35%
at 0.1 and 0.2 m.e. of M-TTR, respectively, and by ca. 52 and 70%
at 0.1 and 0.2 m.e. of WT-TTR, respectively (Figure 3d). As this is a small decrease compared
to the decrease of primary nucleation, it was not observed in unseeded
experiments, where the inhibition of primary nucleation dominates.
As a further check, we show how the unseeded and the 2% seeded traces
can be described by the simultaneous inhibition of both primary and
secondary nucleations (Supporting Information, Figure S2). These fits confirm the inhibition of both primary
and secondary nucleations.

In conclusion, the agreement between
the experimental traces and their fits suggests that the inhibition
of Aβ40 fibril formation observed in the unseeded
experiments by WT-TTR and M-TTR is largely due to an inhibition of
primary nucleation and, in part, secondary nucleation (Figure 3e). The efficiency of this
inhibition was found to be different for the two forms of TTR, however,
as the comparison of the kinetic plots obtained at the same concentrations
of TTR molecules in terms of monomeric subunits shows that WT-TTR
is able to inhibit both primary and secondary nucleations to a greater
extent than M-TTR.

The aggregation process of Aβ40 was also probed using phase-controlled and high-resolution
atomic
force microscopy (AFM), with and without M-TTR to follow the time-dependent
appearance of the various aggregate morphologies. Aβ40 was incubated under the same solution conditions at a concentration
of 10 μM in the absence or presence of 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR, and
samples were withdrawn and analyzed at various times between 0 and
4 h (Figure 4a). We
did not perform the same experiment with WT-TTR because the aggregation
process was still in the lag phase under these conditions after 4
h (Figure 2a). In the
absence of M-TTR, after incubation for 1 h, corresponding to the lag
phase in the ThT fluorescence time course, aggregated species with
a height of 0.2–0.4 nm were the predominant species, attributable
to the individual polypeptide chains in a monomeric state deposited
on the mica surface; however, a small but significant population of
species with a height of 0.5–1.0 nm was present and can be
attributed to oligomers (Figure 4b,c). Indeed, such species are likely to have a larger
diameter in suspension than that estimated here, as a consequence
of both the minor deformations caused by the cantilever tip on the
oligomer shape and of the discoidal shape of the oligomers that results
from the fact that AFM measures accurately their height rather than
their width. After incubation for 3 h, i.e., during the exponential
phase in the ThT fluorescence time course, a modest population of
species with a height of 2–4 nm, attributable to protofibrils
and protofilaments, is clearly present. After incubation for 4 h,
corresponding to the plateau phase, a large population of mature fibrils,
with a height of approximately 6–9 nm, dominates the sample,
along with some of the protofilaments with a height of 2–4
nm46−48 (Figure 4b).

M-TTR delays
the formation of Aβ40 amyloid fibrils.

at 0, 1, 3, and 4 h of aggregation after a twofold dilution. (c) Statistical
analysis and box-chart representation of the height of the oligomers

In the presence of 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR, amyloid fibril formation
was substantially slower than in its absence, and monomers with a
height of 0.2–0.4 nm persisted after 3 h and were still the
predominant species after 4 h, where only a small number of short,
2–3 nm high protofibrils were detected (Figure 4b). Nevertheless, larger numbers of oligomers
were observed during the lag phase in the presence of M-TTR, as after
1 h of incubation species with heights of 0.5–1.2 nm were predominant,
and even larger oligomers with heights greater than 1.2 nm were detected
(Figure 4b,c and Supporting
Information, Figure S3). These results
indicate that M-TTR inhibits the process of amyloid fibril formation
by Aβ40.

We next studied
the intrinsic fluorescence of TTRs during Aβ40 fibril
formation to probe possible conformational changes of TTRs when interacting
with Aβ40. WT-TTR and M-TTR have two tryptophan (Trp)
residues in each monomer subunit, at positions 41 and 79, whereas
Aβ40 does not have any, making it possible to attribute
the observed intrinsic fluorescence entirely to TTR molecules. Moreover,
only Trp41 is fluorescent in the native state because Trp79 fluorescence
is naturally quenched.31,49,50 For this reason, we analyzed a W79F mutant of M-TTR, which contains
the only fluorescent Trp41, avoiding complications arising from Trp79
fluorescence increases during conformational changes.

Aβ40 (10 μM) was incubated under the same conditions as
described above. At regular time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn
and mixed with W79F-M-TTR. The final conditions were 9 μM Aβ40, 3 μM (0.3 m.e.) W79F-M-TTR, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
25 °C. The Trp intrinsic fluorescence was then measured immediately
after mixing and plotted versus time of Aβ40 aggregation
(Figure 5A). As Aβ40 aggregation proceeds, Trp fluorescence increases until an
apparent equilibrium is reached. This occurs with an apparent rate
constant of 4.3(±1.3) × 10–4 s–1, indicating that such a change occurs within the lag phase of Aβ40 fibril formation. Since M-TTR does not bind monomeric Aβ40,7 the observed change can be
attributed to its binding to Aβ40 in an oligomeric
state.

TTRs undergo a conformational change, but maintain their topology,
upon binding to Aβ40 oligomers. (A, B) Time course
of Trp intrinsic fluorescence measured after mixing an aliquot of
Aβ40 undergoing aggregation (at the indicated time
points) and an aliquot of an unlabeled (A) or DACM-labeled (B) W79F-M-TTR.
The solid lines result from a procedure of best fitting using single-exponential
functions. (C) Time courses of FRET E (blue) and
Cys10-Trp41 distance R (purple) using the values
derived from (A) and (B). The solid lines are best-fits to single-exponential
functions. (D–F) Far-UV CD spectra measured after incubating
Aβ40 with WT-TTR (D), M-TTR (E), and W79F-M-TTR (F),
for 30 min using a total protein concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 and using a 1:3 molar ratio of TTR/Aβ40 (purple).
Spectra of Aβ40 alone (red) or TTR alone (green)
are also shown. Spectra reconstructed from a linear combination of
the spectra of Aβ40 alone and TTR alone using a 1:3
molar ratio, as described in Materials and Methods, are also shown (blue).

The analysis was then repeated under identical experimental conditions
using W79F-M-TTR covalently labeled with N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)maleimide
(DACM) at Cys10 (Figure 5B). DACM acts as an acceptor of the fluorescence emitted from Trp41
due to FRET.31 The initial Trp fluorescence
at time 0, in the absence of Aβ40, is very low due
to FRET (compare the y scales in Figure 5A,B). The Trp fluorescence
then increases with a rate similar to that of the unlabeled mutant,
i.e., 4.3(±1.0) × 10–4 s–1. By determining the FRET efficiency (E) values
at any given time using the Trp fluorescence values reported in Figure 5A,B and by converting
such values into distance R between Cys10-DACM and
Trp41, plots of E vs time and R vs
time could be reconstructed,31 showing
a time-dependent decrease of the FRET E value attributable
to a conformational change that increases slightly, but significantly,
the distance between Cys10 and Trp41 (Figure 5C).

We next used far-UV
circular dichroism (CD) to probe possible changes in the secondary
structure of the various forms of TTR when interacting with Aβ40. In particular, we acquired far-UV CD spectra of the three
forms of TTR alone and after co-incubation for 30 min with Aβ40, a time sufficient for the TTR molecules to interact with
oligomeric Aβ40, as indicated by the intrinsic fluorescence
measurements (Figure 5D–F). The total protein concentration was 0.1 mg mL–1, corresponding to 23 and 7.3 μM for Aβ40 and
TTR monomers, respectively, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25
°C. The far-UV CD spectra after incubating WT-TTR and Aβ40 for 30 min are largely superimposable with that obtained
by averaging the spectra recorded for the two proteins individually
(Figure 5D). This is
in agreement with a previous report on a similar time scale.8 Similar conclusions were obtained when the analysis
was repeated with M-TTR (Figure 5E) and W79F-M-TTR (Figure 5F). Hence, the interaction of all three forms
of TTR with Aβ40 during the lag phase of its aggregation
process does not even partially disrupt the secondary structure of
the TTR species.

Previous studies have shown that WT-TTR and M-TTR can interact
with preformed toxic oligomers of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and inhibit their toxicity.7,12,13 We therefore repeated our biophysical analysis using
preformed amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) formed by Aβ42 that have previously been shown to be toxic to rat neuronal
cells, rat hippocampal neurons, and mice organotypic hippocampal slice
cultures.12,25,51−53 The identity of our ADDL preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting (Supporting Information, Figure S4a), as previously reported.51 The TTR molecules that we used were M-TTR and its mutant W79F-M-TTR
because M-TTR was found to be the most effective form for suppressing
the toxicity of Aβ42 oligomers.13 The binding of M-TTR with the Aβ42 ADDLs
was checked with two independent tests (Supporting Information, Figure S4b–e).

M-TTR (4 μM)
was then incubated with or without preformed Aβ42 ADDLs (12 μM, m.e.) in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4, at 37 °C, and far-UV CD spectra were recorded after 0,
20, 40, and 60 min. The spectrum of M-TTR was found to be stable with
time and to be typical of an all-β protein, as described above
(Figure 6a). The spectrum
of the Aβ42 ADDLs in the absence of M-TTR was also
stable with time and had a low value of mean residue ellipticity with
a negative peak at 218 nm, indicating a significant level of organized
secondary structure (Figure 6b). The spectrum of Aβ42 ADDLs in the presence
of M-TTR was stable with time and similar to that obtained by adding
together the spectra of M-TTR alone and ADDLs alone (Figure 6c). The analysis was repeated
for W79F-M-TTR, leading to very similar results (Supporting Information, Figure S5a–c), confirming that no change
of secondary structure and topology occurs for M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR
following their interaction with Aβ42 ADDLs.

M-TTR undergoes
a specific conformational change, while maintaining
the topology, upon binding to Aβ42 ADDLs. (a–c)
Far-UV CD spectra of M-TTR (a), Aβ42 ADDLs (b), and
M-TTR plus Aβ42 ADDLs (c) measured at the indicated
times of incubation using a protein concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 (a, b) or 0.2 mg mL–1 with a 1:1
mass ratio of M-TTR: Aβ42 ADDLs (c). In panel (c),
the experimental spectra (continuous lines) are compared with those
obtained by summing the spectra of M-TTR alone and ADDLs alone (dashed
lines). (d–h) Fluorescence spectra recorded for both M-TTR
(d, e) and DACM-M-TTR (g, h) in the absence (d, g) and presence (e,
h) of Aβ42 ADDLs after the indicated times of incubation.
Fluorescence spectra recorded for Aβ42 ADDLs alone
are also shown (f). (i) FRET E values of M-TTR in
the absence (green) and presence (red) of Aβ42 ADDLs.

The
interaction between ADDLs and M-TTR was also studied by means of intrinsic
fluorescence and FRET using the same experimental conditions as those
described in the previous section. The fluorescence spectra of both
M-TTR and DACM-M-TTR were found to be stable within the first hour
of incubation in the absence of the ADDLs (Figure 6d,g), whereas those recorded in their presence
decreased in intensity with time (Figure 6e,h), indicating a progressive interaction
of M-TTR and DACM-M-TTR with the ADDLs. The ADDLs were not fluorescent,
indicating that this species does not contribute to the observed fluorescence
spectra (Figure 6f).
The FRET E value of M-TTR in the absence of the ADDLs
was stable with time (Figure 6i) and similar to that measured previously,31 whereas that in their presence decreased progressively
(Figure 6i). This analysis
was repeated for the W79F mutant of M-TTR, leading to very similar
results (Supporting Information, Figure S5d–i). These results indicate that a conformational change occurs for
M-TTR or its mutant following the interaction with ADDLs and also
indicate an increased spatial distance between DACM-Cys10 and the
two tryptophan side chains, especially Trp41.

We then evaluated
whether the interaction between
TTR and ADDLs was able to suppress the toxicity of the oligomers.
We first added preformed ADDLs to the cell culture medium of human
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of 12 μM (m.e.),
confirming their toxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Supporting Information, Figure S6a). We then treated the cells with ADDLs preincubated for
1 h in the presence of 1.2 μM WT-TTR or M-TTR (m.e.) and found
no detectable toxicity, with a level of MTT reduction similar to that
of untreated cells or to cells treated with the Aβ42 monomers (Supporting Information, Figure S6a). Similar results were obtained from analyzing caspase-3 activity,
a well-recognized apoptotic marker, using confocal microscopy (Supporting
Information, Figure S6b). Fluorescence
microscopy images and the corresponding semiquantitative values of
the green fluorescence signal associated with caspase-3 activity show
that WT-TTR and M-TTR significantly prevented the apoptotic response
induced by ADDLs (Supporting Information, Figure S6b). These results confirm the ability of M-TTR and WT-TTR
to suppress the toxicity of ADDLs (Figure 3e), as previously reported.13

### Aβ40, WT-TTR, and M-TTR Are Not Aggregated
After Purification

Samples of Aβ40, WT-TTR,
and M-TTR were generated as described in Materials
and Methods, and analysis with SDS-PAGE showed that the proteins
were electrophoretically pure. An initial preliminary analysis was
carried out with dynamic light scattering (DLS) to rule out the possibility
that any of the three purified proteins had aggregated prior to the
analysis. The Aβ40 peptide was found to have an apparent
hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of 3.0 ±
0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), in agreement with previously reported values33 and with the expectations originating from general polymer
scaling arguments for a monomeric unfolded 40-residue long peptide,
i.e., 3.5 ± 0.734 or 3.6 ± 1.7
nm.35 M-TTR was found to have a Dh value of 4.2 ± 0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), in good agreement with values previously
determined experimentally22,36,37 and with the value theoretically expected for a monomeric 127-residue
globular protein, i.e., 3.9 ± 0.9 nm.35 WT-TTR was found to have a Dh value
of 6.2 ± 0.1 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S1), which is in good agreement with that expected
for the folded tetrameric state, as calculated from geometric laws.

### Secondary Nucleation Step in Aβ40 Aggregation
Is Saturated Under the Used Conditions

We then monitored
the aggregation of Aβ40 at various concentrations
in a buffer close to physiological conditions and probed the progress
of the aggregation reaction using ThT fluorescence at 480 nm (excitation
440 nm). Specifically, Aβ40 was incubated at a series
of concentrations between 1.0 and 5.0 μM in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM ThT, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, under
quiescent conditions. The ThT fluorescence values of the resulting
samples were measured at regular time intervals and plotted as a function
of time (Figure 1a).
In previous work, ThT was not found to significantly affect the rate
of fibril formation of Aβ40.27 In all cases, the time courses followed a characteristic sigmoidal
profile with lag, exponential, and plateau phases. The length of the
lag phase was found to decrease with the Aβ40 concentration,
and the steepness of the exponential phase increased, as well as the
final ThT fluorescence measured at the plateau, which is proportional
to the peptide concentration to a good approximation (Figure 1a).38 Three samples were prepared for each Aβ40 concentration,
and the resulting kinetic traces were found to show little variation
(Figure 1a).

Secondary nucleation
step in Aβ40 aggregation
is kinetically saturated. (a) Time courses of amyloid fibril formation
at the indicated Aβ40 concentrations, (b) half-time
of Aβ40 aggregation versus the initial monomer concentration,
as derived from (a). The solid line is the theoretical prediction
of the half-time using eq 10. Error bars are standard deviations (s.d.). (c) Normalized
time courses as derived from (a). The solid lines show predictions
for the resulting reaction profiles using a kinetic model containing
the microscopic steps of primary nucleation and fibril elongation
and a multistep secondary nucleation (eq 3) with fixed reaction orders of nc = n2 = 2.27

To interpret quantitatively these
time courses, we considered first
the half-time of the fibril mass formation as a function of the initial
monomer concentration, which yields the exponent γ that informs
on the dominant nucleation mechanisms active in a given system.27 In the case of Aβ40 aggregation,
it has been found to vary from −1.2 at low Aβ40 concentrations to −0.2 at high Aβ40 concentrations.27 This is due to the fact that at low monomer
concentrations, where γ is highly negative, rates of secondary
nucleation are predominantly determined by the attachment of free
monomers to the surface of the fibrils, and thus the rates depend
strongly on the monomer concentration. Instead, at high monomer concentrations,
where γ is lower, secondary nucleation is saturated, as secondary
nucleation sites are fully occupied by monomers. Under these conditions,
the rate of nucleation is no longer dependent on the concentration
of free monomers but is governed by the rate of conversion and detachment
of the bound monomers on the fibril surface.27 Interestingly, the data in Figure 1b show an exponent γ above −1.0 (less
negative), at all monomer concentrations, indicating that secondary
nucleation is likely to have approached saturation under the conditions
explored here. This saturation at lower concentrations than those
observed previously is likely a result of the increased ionic strength
under the conditions used here. As established previously, an increase
in ionic strength promotes the attachment step during the secondary
nucleation of Aβ and thus leads to saturation at lower concentrations.39

We next proceeded to assess if all kinetic
traces could be quantitatively
reproduced from a molecular model in which saturated secondary nucleation
is the mechanism dominating the kinetics of aggregation, as suggested
by the scaling analysis discussed above. To this effect, all of the
kinetic traces were first normalized to the same fibrillar mass concentration
by dividing the ThT fluorescence intensity at time t ([M]t) by the corresponding values measured
at the plateau ([M]∞), taken as 1.0 or 100% (Figure 1c). Oligomer concentrations
were found to be small compared to monomer and fibrillar concentrations
and thus do not need to be considered explicitly in this normalization.40 The resulting time courses of [M]t/[M]∞ at different Aβ40 concentrations were then analyzed simultaneously by generating
the best fits to the experimental data using a single rate law (eq 3) that was derived from
a model that includes the specific microscopic steps of primary nucleation,
fibril elongation, and a saturated secondary nucleation process (eqs 1 and 2), as described previously27 and in Materials and Methods (Figure 1c). From the fitting of the model, we also
found that the concentration at which secondary nucleation has reached
half-saturation (Km1/2) was
below the range of Aβ40 concentrations studied here
(1–5 μM), in agreement with the idea that the saturation
of the secondary nucleation pathway is expected at the measured monomer
concentrations.

### WT-TTR and M-TTR Inhibit Primary Nucleation
in the Process of
Aβ40 Aggregation

The time courses of amyloid
fibril formation by 5.0 μM Aβ40 were studied
under the same solution conditions in the absence and presence of
tetrameric WT-TTR and monomeric M-TTR at different concentrations,
ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 molar equivalents (m.e.) of monomeric TTR
subunits (Figure 2a–f).
All concentrations of TTR molecules reported here refer to concentrations
of monomeric TTR subunits. The fibril formation kinetics of a 5.0
μM sample of Aβ40 were found to be significantly
slowed down in the presence of either TTR variant, but the comparison
of kinetic traces at similar m.e. shows that WT-TTR has a more effective
inhibitory effect. When the two forms of TTR studied here were incubated
under the same experimental conditions in the absence of Aβ40, the ThT fluorescence was not found to increase with time,
even with very high concentrations of M-TTR and WT-TTR (Figure 2g).

WT-TTR and M-TTR display
strong inhibition of primary nucleation
in Aβ40 aggregation. (a–f) Time courses of
fibril formation by 5.0 μM Aβ40 in the presence
of WT-TTR (a–c) and M-TTR (d–f) at the indicated concentrations
(m.e.). The solid lines are fits of the kinetic profiles by a model
in which secondary nucleation (a, d), elongation (b, e), or primary
nucleation (c, f) is inhibited by TTRs. (g) Incubation of 20, 30,
and 50 μM WT-TTR and M-TTR under the same conditions in the
absence of Aβ40. (h) Change in the effective rate
constants of primary nucleation in Aβ40 aggregation,
as derived from (e) and (f), shown with increasing concentrations
of WT-TTR (green) and M-TTR (black). Error bars are s.d. of the rates
obtained from individual fitting of the repeats. The traces in (a)–(f)
show the average traces of those repeats.

We then carried out a quantitative analysis of the effects of the
two different TTR species by fitting the rate law determined in the
absence of TTR but allowing some of the rates to vary (see Materials and Methods).26,41 The kinetic aggregation traces in Figure 2a–f could be fitted to the moment
equation after introducing suitable perturbations to single rate constants
describing individual microscopic processes (eq 3). This approach thereby indicated which specific
microscopic steps were affected by the presence of the TTR species
and showed that the unseeded aggregation kinetics of Aβ40 in the presence of a range of M-TTR or WT-TTR concentrations
investigated here are very well described when the primary nucleation
rate constant (kn) is
specifically decreased (Figure 2c,f). By contrast, the experimental data are not consistent
with predictions made by altering the rate constants of secondary
nucleation (k2) or elongation (k+) (Figure 2a,b,d,e).

This analysis reveals that in the presence
of M-TTR or WT-TTR,
the primary nucleation pathway, which is governed by the product of
the rate constants of elongation and primary nucleation (k+kn), is
specifically perturbed. In particular, the k+kn value in the
presence of the TTR species (k+knapp) was found
to decrease by a factor of approximately 10 and 106 with
0.1 m.e. of WT-TTR and M-TTR, respectively, relative to that in the
absence of TTRs (k+kn) (Figure 2h and Supporting Information, Table S1). Hence, the analysis indicates that the inhibitory effects
of WT-TTR and M-TTR on unseeded Aβ40 aggregation
originate largely from the modulation of a single key microscopic
step, i.e., primary nucleation.

### WT-TTR and M-TTR Do Not
Modify the Elongation Step in Aβ40 Aggregation

The analysis described so far identified
primary nucleation as the most strongly affected kinetic quantity.
To probe whether there was also a small effect on elongation rate
(k+) that was not visible in the unseeded
data due to the strong effect on primary nucleation, we recorded time
courses of Aβ40 fibril formation under the same conditions,
but in the presence of large quantities of preformed fibrils of Aβ40, corresponding to 25% of soluble Aβ40 in
m.e. and in the presence of 0.2 and 0.4 m.e. of WT-TTR and M-TTR (Figure 3a). With 25% of preformed
fibrils, the primary and secondary nucleation steps are effectively
bypassed, the overall number of aggregates remains approximately constant
in time, and the dominant mechanism responsible for the consumption
of monomeric Aβ40 is the elongation of the preformed
fibrils.40,42 In the absence of TTR, amyloid fibril formation
by Aβ40 was very rapid and without a detectable lag
phase, as expected due to the presence of seed fibrils (Figure 3a). Neither 0.2 nor 0.4 m.e.
of WT-TTR and M-TTR was found to affect significantly the aggregation
kinetics (Figure 3a,b),
revealing that Aβ40 fibril elongation is not affected
by the presence of either TTR form.

WT-TTR and M-TTR cause significant inhibition
of secondary nucleation,
but not elongation, in Aβ40 aggregation. (a) Kinetic

for the resulting reaction profiles when secondary nucleation (k2) is allowed to vary by the different TTR species.

and M-TTR (red crosses). Bottom right: binding of TTR molecules to
Aβ oligomers and inhibition of their toxicity.

### WT-TTR and M-TTR Inhibit Secondary Nucleation in Aβ40 Aggregation

To probe whether there was also an
effect on secondary nucleation rate constant (k2) in the presence of the two forms of TTR that was not visible
in the unseeded data due to the strong effect on primary nucleation,
we repeated the experiments described above in the presence of smaller
quantities of preformed fibrils of Aβ40 (2% m.e.).
At this concentration of fibril seeds, primary nucleation is bypassed,
but both fibril elongation and surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation
contribute significantly to the overall kinetics of fibril formation.42−45 In the absence of either form of TTR, the entire process of Aβ40 fibril formation was found to have an intermediate rate
relative to the corresponding processes in the absence and presence
of 25% seeds, with a short lag phase still detectable (Figure 3c). In the presence of 0.1
and 0.2 m.e. of M-TTR and WT-TTR, the fibril formation process was
significantly slowed down in a concentration-dependent manner, with
the efficiency of inhibition being higher for WT-TTR than for M-TTR
(Figure 3c,d). Since
neither M-TTR nor WT-TTR affects Aβ40 fibril elongation
at these concentrations (Figure 3a,b), and the primary nucleation step is bypassed with
2% fibrillar seeds, this retardation can be attributed to a decrease
in the rate constant of secondary nucleation (k2). Indeed, the experimental time courses are well described
when only k2 is varied in the presence
of increasing concentrations of M-TTR and WT-TTR (Figure 3c,d). The k2 values were found to be decreased by ca. 32 and 35%
at 0.1 and 0.2 m.e. of M-TTR, respectively, and by ca. 52 and 70%
at 0.1 and 0.2 m.e. of WT-TTR, respectively (Figure 3d). As this is a small decrease compared
to the decrease of primary nucleation, it was not observed in unseeded
experiments, where the inhibition of primary nucleation dominates.
As a further check, we show how the unseeded and the 2% seeded traces
can be described by the simultaneous inhibition of both primary and
secondary nucleations (Supporting Information, Figure S2). These fits confirm the inhibition of both primary
and secondary nucleations.

In conclusion, the agreement between
the experimental traces and their fits suggests that the inhibition
of Aβ40 fibril formation observed in the unseeded
experiments by WT-TTR and M-TTR is largely due to an inhibition of
primary nucleation and, in part, secondary nucleation (Figure 3e). The efficiency of this
inhibition was found to be different for the two forms of TTR, however,
as the comparison of the kinetic plots obtained at the same concentrations
of TTR molecules in terms of monomeric subunits shows that WT-TTR
is able to inhibit both primary and secondary nucleations to a greater
extent than M-TTR.

### M-TTR Delays the Deposition of Amyloid Fibrils
of Aβ40

The aggregation process of Aβ40 was also probed using phase-controlled and high-resolution
atomic
force microscopy (AFM), with and without M-TTR to follow the time-dependent
appearance of the various aggregate morphologies. Aβ40 was incubated under the same solution conditions at a concentration
of 10 μM in the absence or presence of 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR, and
samples were withdrawn and analyzed at various times between 0 and
4 h (Figure 4a). We
did not perform the same experiment with WT-TTR because the aggregation
process was still in the lag phase under these conditions after 4
h (Figure 2a). In the
absence of M-TTR, after incubation for 1 h, corresponding to the lag
phase in the ThT fluorescence time course, aggregated species with
a height of 0.2–0.4 nm were the predominant species, attributable
to the individual polypeptide chains in a monomeric state deposited
on the mica surface; however, a small but significant population of
species with a height of 0.5–1.0 nm was present and can be
attributed to oligomers (Figure 4b,c). Indeed, such species are likely to have a larger
diameter in suspension than that estimated here, as a consequence
of both the minor deformations caused by the cantilever tip on the
oligomer shape and of the discoidal shape of the oligomers that results
from the fact that AFM measures accurately their height rather than
their width. After incubation for 3 h, i.e., during the exponential
phase in the ThT fluorescence time course, a modest population of
species with a height of 2–4 nm, attributable to protofibrils
and protofilaments, is clearly present. After incubation for 4 h,
corresponding to the plateau phase, a large population of mature fibrils,
with a height of approximately 6–9 nm, dominates the sample,
along with some of the protofilaments with a height of 2–4
nm46−48 (Figure 4b).

M-TTR delays
the formation of Aβ40 amyloid fibrils.

the time points of sample withdrawal for AFM imaging. (b) AFM images
at 0, 1, 3, and 4 h of aggregation after a twofold dilution. (c) Statistical
analysis and box-chart representation of the height of the oligomers

In the presence of 0.08 m.e. of M-TTR, amyloid fibril formation
was substantially slower than in its absence, and monomers with a
height of 0.2–0.4 nm persisted after 3 h and were still the
predominant species after 4 h, where only a small number of short,
2–3 nm high protofibrils were detected (Figure 4b). Nevertheless, larger numbers of oligomers
were observed during the lag phase in the presence of M-TTR, as after
1 h of incubation species with heights of 0.5–1.2 nm were predominant,
and even larger oligomers with heights greater than 1.2 nm were detected
(Figure 4b,c and Supporting
Information, Figure S3). These results
indicate that M-TTR inhibits the process of amyloid fibril formation
by Aβ40.

### WT-TTR and M-TTR Undergo a Specific Conformational
Change Upon
Binding to Aβ40 Oligomers

We next studied
the intrinsic fluorescence of TTRs during Aβ40 fibril
formation to probe possible conformational changes of TTRs when interacting
with Aβ40. WT-TTR and M-TTR have two tryptophan (Trp)
residues in each monomer subunit, at positions 41 and 79, whereas
Aβ40 does not have any, making it possible to attribute
the observed intrinsic fluorescence entirely to TTR molecules. Moreover,
only Trp41 is fluorescent in the native state because Trp79 fluorescence
is naturally quenched.31,49,50 For this reason, we analyzed a W79F mutant of M-TTR, which contains
the only fluorescent Trp41, avoiding complications arising from Trp79
fluorescence increases during conformational changes.

Aβ40 (10 μM) was incubated under the same conditions as
described above. At regular time intervals, aliquots were withdrawn
and mixed with W79F-M-TTR. The final conditions were 9 μM Aβ40, 3 μM (0.3 m.e.) W79F-M-TTR, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
25 °C. The Trp intrinsic fluorescence was then measured immediately
after mixing and plotted versus time of Aβ40 aggregation
(Figure 5A). As Aβ40 aggregation proceeds, Trp fluorescence increases until an
apparent equilibrium is reached. This occurs with an apparent rate
constant of 4.3(±1.3) × 10–4 s–1, indicating that such a change occurs within the lag phase of Aβ40 fibril formation. Since M-TTR does not bind monomeric Aβ40,7 the observed change can be
attributed to its binding to Aβ40 in an oligomeric
state.

TTRs undergo a conformational change, but maintain their topology,
upon binding to Aβ40 oligomers. (A, B) Time course
of Trp intrinsic fluorescence measured after mixing an aliquot of
Aβ40 undergoing aggregation (at the indicated time
points) and an aliquot of an unlabeled (A) or DACM-labeled (B) W79F-M-TTR.
The solid lines result from a procedure of best fitting using single-exponential
functions. (C) Time courses of FRET E (blue) and
Cys10-Trp41 distance R (purple) using the values
derived from (A) and (B). The solid lines are best-fits to single-exponential
functions. (D–F) Far-UV CD spectra measured after incubating
Aβ40 with WT-TTR (D), M-TTR (E), and W79F-M-TTR (F),
for 30 min using a total protein concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 and using a 1:3 molar ratio of TTR/Aβ40 (purple).
Spectra of Aβ40 alone (red) or TTR alone (green)
are also shown. Spectra reconstructed from a linear combination of
the spectra of Aβ40 alone and TTR alone using a 1:3
molar ratio, as described in Materials and Methods, are also shown (blue).

The analysis was then repeated under identical experimental conditions
using W79F-M-TTR covalently labeled with N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)maleimide
(DACM) at Cys10 (Figure 5B). DACM acts as an acceptor of the fluorescence emitted from Trp41
due to FRET.31 The initial Trp fluorescence
at time 0, in the absence of Aβ40, is very low due
to FRET (compare the y scales in Figure 5A,B). The Trp fluorescence
then increases with a rate similar to that of the unlabeled mutant,
i.e., 4.3(±1.0) × 10–4 s–1. By determining the FRET efficiency (E) values
at any given time using the Trp fluorescence values reported in Figure 5A,B and by converting
such values into distance R between Cys10-DACM and
Trp41, plots of E vs time and R vs
time could be reconstructed,31 showing
a time-dependent decrease of the FRET E value attributable
to a conformational change that increases slightly, but significantly,
the distance between Cys10 and Trp41 (Figure 5C).

### Overall Fold of WT-TTR and M-TTR Is Unchanged
During the Lag
Phase of Aβ40 Aggregation

We next used far-UV
circular dichroism (CD) to probe possible changes in the secondary
structure of the various forms of TTR when interacting with Aβ40. In particular, we acquired far-UV CD spectra of the three
forms of TTR alone and after co-incubation for 30 min with Aβ40, a time sufficient for the TTR molecules to interact with
oligomeric Aβ40, as indicated by the intrinsic fluorescence
measurements (Figure 5D–F). The total protein concentration was 0.1 mg mL–1, corresponding to 23 and 7.3 μM for Aβ40 and
TTR monomers, respectively, in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25
°C. The far-UV CD spectra after incubating WT-TTR and Aβ40 for 30 min are largely superimposable with that obtained
by averaging the spectra recorded for the two proteins individually
(Figure 5D). This is
in agreement with a previous report on a similar time scale.8 Similar conclusions were obtained when the analysis
was repeated with M-TTR (Figure 5E) and W79F-M-TTR (Figure 5F). Hence, the interaction of all three forms
of TTR with Aβ40 during the lag phase of its aggregation
process does not even partially disrupt the secondary structure of
the TTR species.

### Different Forms of TTR Maintain Their Topology
and Secondary
Structure Upon Binding to Toxic Aβ42 Oligomers

Previous studies have shown that WT-TTR and M-TTR can interact
with preformed toxic oligomers of Aβ40 and Aβ42 and inhibit their toxicity.7,12,13 We therefore repeated our biophysical analysis using
preformed amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) formed by Aβ42 that have previously been shown to be toxic to rat neuronal
cells, rat hippocampal neurons, and mice organotypic hippocampal slice
cultures.12,25,51−53 The identity of our ADDL preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting (Supporting Information, Figure S4a), as previously reported.51 The TTR molecules that we used were M-TTR and its mutant W79F-M-TTR
because M-TTR was found to be the most effective form for suppressing
the toxicity of Aβ42 oligomers.13 The binding of M-TTR with the Aβ42 ADDLs
was checked with two independent tests (Supporting Information, Figure S4b–e).

M-TTR (4 μM)
was then incubated with or without preformed Aβ42 ADDLs (12 μM, m.e.) in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4, at 37 °C, and far-UV CD spectra were recorded after 0,
20, 40, and 60 min. The spectrum of M-TTR was found to be stable with
time and to be typical of an all-β protein, as described above
(Figure 6a). The spectrum
of the Aβ42 ADDLs in the absence of M-TTR was also
stable with time and had a low value of mean residue ellipticity with
a negative peak at 218 nm, indicating a significant level of organized
secondary structure (Figure 6b). The spectrum of Aβ42 ADDLs in the presence
of M-TTR was stable with time and similar to that obtained by adding
together the spectra of M-TTR alone and ADDLs alone (Figure 6c). The analysis was repeated
for W79F-M-TTR, leading to very similar results (Supporting Information, Figure S5a–c), confirming that no change
of secondary structure and topology occurs for M-TTR or W79F-M-TTR
following their interaction with Aβ42 ADDLs.

M-TTR undergoes
a specific conformational change, while maintaining
the topology, upon binding to Aβ42 ADDLs. (a–c)
Far-UV CD spectra of M-TTR (a), Aβ42 ADDLs (b), and
M-TTR plus Aβ42 ADDLs (c) measured at the indicated
times of incubation using a protein concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 (a, b) or 0.2 mg mL–1 with a 1:1
mass ratio of M-TTR: Aβ42 ADDLs (c). In panel (c),
the experimental spectra (continuous lines) are compared with those
obtained by summing the spectra of M-TTR alone and ADDLs alone (dashed
lines). (d–h) Fluorescence spectra recorded for both M-TTR
(d, e) and DACM-M-TTR (g, h) in the absence (d, g) and presence (e,
h) of Aβ42 ADDLs after the indicated times of incubation.
Fluorescence spectra recorded for Aβ42 ADDLs alone
are also shown (f). (i) FRET E values of M-TTR in
the absence (green) and presence (red) of Aβ42 ADDLs.

### Various TTR Species Undergo a Specific Conformational
Change
Upon Binding to Toxic Aβ42 Oligomers

The
interaction between ADDLs and M-TTR was also studied by means of intrinsic
fluorescence and FRET using the same experimental conditions as those
described in the previous section. The fluorescence spectra of both
M-TTR and DACM-M-TTR were found to be stable within the first hour
of incubation in the absence of the ADDLs (Figure 6d,g), whereas those recorded in their presence
decreased in intensity with time (Figure 6e,h), indicating a progressive interaction
of M-TTR and DACM-M-TTR with the ADDLs. The ADDLs were not fluorescent,
indicating that this species does not contribute to the observed fluorescence
spectra (Figure 6f).
The FRET E value of M-TTR in the absence of the ADDLs
was stable with time (Figure 6i) and similar to that measured previously,31 whereas that in their presence decreased progressively
(Figure 6i). This analysis
was repeated for the W79F mutant of M-TTR, leading to very similar
results (Supporting Information, Figure S5d–i). These results indicate that a conformational change occurs for
M-TTR or its mutant following the interaction with ADDLs and also
indicate an increased spatial distance between DACM-Cys10 and the
two tryptophan side chains, especially Trp41.

### Various TTR Species Suppress
the Toxicity of Aβ42 Oligomers

We then evaluated
whether the interaction between
TTR and ADDLs was able to suppress the toxicity of the oligomers.
We first added preformed ADDLs to the cell culture medium of human
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of 12 μM (m.e.),
confirming their toxicity using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Supporting Information, Figure S6a). We then treated the cells with ADDLs preincubated for
1 h in the presence of 1.2 μM WT-TTR or M-TTR (m.e.) and found
no detectable toxicity, with a level of MTT reduction similar to that
of untreated cells or to cells treated with the Aβ42 monomers (Supporting Information, Figure S6a). Similar results were obtained from analyzing caspase-3 activity,
a well-recognized apoptotic marker, using confocal microscopy (Supporting
Information, Figure S6b). Fluorescence
microscopy images and the corresponding semiquantitative values of
the green fluorescence signal associated with caspase-3 activity show
that WT-TTR and M-TTR significantly prevented the apoptotic response
induced by ADDLs (Supporting Information, Figure S6b). These results confirm the ability of M-TTR and WT-TTR
to suppress the toxicity of ADDLs (Figure 3e), as previously reported.13

### Discussion

In this work, we have confirmed the inhibition of the process of
amyloid fibril formation by Aβ40 that is mediated
by monomeric and tetrameric forms of TTR,6,7,10 but have, in addition, studied this process
further by investigating the microscopic mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon. We have shown that this inhibitory effect results from
the ability of the different forms of TTR to slow down the microscopic
steps of both primary and secondary nucleations while leaving the
elongation step unaffected (Figure 3e).

How can we interpret these results? Under
the conditions of highly substoichiometric concentrations of WT-TTR
and M-TTR used here, nearly all of the Aβ40 molecules
will be unbound in solution, regardless of the binding affinity. The
lack of any effect of WT-TTR and M-TTR on the rate of the microscopic
step of fibril elongation observed here and previously54 is consistent with the hypothesis that binding
between TTR molecules and Aβ40 monomers, if present,
is not significant in determining the kinetics of Aβ40 fibril formation. Hence, the ability of WT-TTR or M-TTR to inhibit
primary nucleation cannot be attributed to their ability to sequester
Aβ40 monomers from the formation of nuclei competent
for growth and elongation. Both WT-TTR and M-TTR can, however, bind
Aβ40 oligomeric species with high affinity,5−8 suggesting that both forms of TTR can bind to the Aβ40 oligomeric species formed in the aggregation process, preventing
their structural reorganization into species that are able to elongate
(Figure 3e). Moreover,
this conclusion is consistent with (i) the observation made in this
study with AFM that M-TTR can stabilize oligomeric Aβ40, (ii) with the recent finding that M-TTR can bind to oligomers and
block their conversion into fibrils,9 and
(iii) with the previous finding that WT-TTR can bind to oligomers
that are positive for the OC antibody and block their growth, maturation,
or reorganization;8 indeed, such OC-positive
oligomers have been shown to be off-pathway species, thus unproductive
for fibril elongation.55 Indeed, such off-pathway
intermediates would be expected to dissociate more slowly than the
overall time scale of the aggregation reaction, and further studies
are needed to address the metastability of the TTR-bound oligomers.
Overall, blockage of primary nucleation does not arise in this case
from monomer sequestration but by interaction with oligomeric species
and inhibition of their conversion and growth into nuclei.

The
lack of effect on Aβ40 fibril elongation indicates
that TTR molecules do not bind strongly to the growing ends of Aβ40 fibrils. By contrast, a significant effect on secondary
nucleation was observed under conditions of saturation of the Aβ40 binding sites on fibril surfaces, in agreement again with
the concept that the various forms of TTR hinder the conversion of
fibril-bound Aβ40 oligomers into species able to
elongate. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for TTR,
as well as extracellular chaperones, in the binding of protein-misfolded
oligomers and inhibition of their toxicity, including “binding
followed by further oligomer clustering” and “binding
causing hydrophobic shielding”.56 Both of these mechanisms have indeed been observed for M-TTR and
toxic HypF-N or Aβ42 oligomers at particular protein:protein
molar ratios.8,9,13,57 The AFM results reported here indicate that
M-TTR can stabilize the smaller Aβ40 oligomers, as
well as induce the formation of larger Aβ40 assemblies,
consistent with these two views.

In our conditions of analysis,
M-TTR was found to be less effective
than WT-TTR in inhibiting Aβ40 fibril formation,
in apparent disagreement with an earlier report under similar conditions.7 The difference can be due to subtle differences
in experimental conditions, as well as in differences in TTR and Aβ40 protein purification.

M-TTR has been shown to be very plastic,
with conformational changes occurring as the pH decreases to values
of 3.9–5.0,58 upon the addition
of small amounts of urea at equilibrium before the major unfolding
transition at pH 7.437 and transiently
during folding from the fully unfolded to the fully folded state at
pH 7.4.37 The data presented here suggest
that M-TTR undergoes a subtle conformational change when interacting
with Aβ40 and Aβ42 oligomers. Far-UV
CD indicates that M-TTR maintains its secondary structure and overall
topology, but fluorescence measurements reveal that it undergoes subtle
changes in conformation, as indicated by small enhancements in tryptophan
fluorescence and increases in the average spatial distances between
the tryptophan residues, particularly Trp41, and the fluorophore attached
to Cys10. Thus, following interaction with Aβ40 oligomers
forming during amyloid fibril formation and stable Aβ42 ADDLs, the FRET efficiency decreases from 0.72 ± 0.02 to 0.60
± 0.03 and 0.57 ± 0.03, respectively, a change that is less
dramatic than that observed upon full unfolding of M-TTR for the same
donor–acceptor pair, where the change is from 0.72 ± 0.02
to 0.29 ± 0.01.31

This conformational
state is distinct from other partially folded or native-like states
observed previously. In fact, the amyloidogenic state of M-TTR at
pH 3.9–5.0 has the same secondary structure and Trp-DACM FRET
efficiency as the native state.31 The conformational
state populated in 1 M urea at pH 7.4 has a far-UV CD spectrum distinct
from that of the native structure, indicating some degree of unfolding,
but indistinguishable fluorescence properties, including similar FRET E values.31,37 Finally, the kinetic folding
intermediate at pH 7.4 has a higher FRET efficiency than, and a similar
β-sheet content to, the native state, again showing a distinction
from the species characterized here.31,37 Such a variety
of partially folded states adopted by M-TTR under the various circumstances
emphasizes the structural plasticity of this protein.

The concentration of WT-TTR is estimated to be 0.09–0.36
μM in the human CSF of healthy individuals.59 WT-TTR is also present in the neurons and brain parenchyma,
although its concentration in these environments has not yet been
determined.11 By contrast, the concentration
of Aβ40 in the CSF of healthy individuals is 0.6–5.0
nM60 and has been determined to be in the
high picomolar to low nanomolar range in the human brain,5,61,62 where the concentration of Aβ42 is even lower.60 The interaction
between WT-TTR and monomeric Aβ40 occurring in solution
has been studied previously7,10 and reported to have
a KD value of 435 ± 19 μM,
using Trp41 intrinsic fluorescence quenching by Aβ40,10 or 24 μM, using solution NMR
and isothermal titration calorimetry.7 With
these protein concentrations and affinities, therefore, only a small
fraction of monomeric Aβ40 is likely to be associated
with tetrameric WT-TTR, i.e., ca. 0.4–1.5% in the CSF, assuming
a KD value of 24 μM.7 A similar order of magnitude (or even lower) is expected
in the brain parenchyma, and the situation for monomeric Aβ42 is likely to be very similar. Although quantitatively negligible,
however, it cannot be excluded that the binding of monomeric Aβ40/Aβ42 to tetrameric TTR can become significant
in some circumstances.7

The most
effective mechanism inhibiting amyloid fibril formation by Aβ40 and Aβ42 in vivo is likely to be the interaction
between WT-TTR (or its dissociated subunits) and Aβ40 or Aβ42 oligomers. It is still unclear whether
WT-TTR binds the Aβ oligomers in its tetrameric form7 or only after dissociation into its constituent
subunits.8 The affinity of WT-TTR and M-TTR
for oligomeric Aβ is much higher than that of monomers.5−9 Consequently, such binding can be an effective strategy through
which TTR inhibits both Aβ fibril formation (by blocking the
conversion of small-sized oligomers into small fibrils through primary
and secondary nucleations) and reducing the toxicity of the oligomers
(Figure 3e). This latter
mechanism of neuroprotection mediated by TTR has been widely described
previously7,11−13 and has been confirmed
in the present study. The former mechanism is as important as the
latter, however, because it is increasingly recognized that the proliferation
of protein aggregates can be dominated by secondary nucleation on
the surfaces of fibrils42,45 and that the spread
of protein deposition diseases through the brain may result from the
diffusion of fibrils.63,64

### TTR Inhibits Primary and
Secondary Nucleations of Aβ by
Binding to Oligomers and Preventing Their Conversion into Short Fibrils

In this work, we have confirmed the inhibition of the process of
amyloid fibril formation by Aβ40 that is mediated
by monomeric and tetrameric forms of TTR,6,7,10 but have, in addition, studied this process
further by investigating the microscopic mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon. We have shown that this inhibitory effect results from
the ability of the different forms of TTR to slow down the microscopic
steps of both primary and secondary nucleations while leaving the
elongation step unaffected (Figure 3e).

How can we interpret these results? Under
the conditions of highly substoichiometric concentrations of WT-TTR
and M-TTR used here, nearly all of the Aβ40 molecules
will be unbound in solution, regardless of the binding affinity. The
lack of any effect of WT-TTR and M-TTR on the rate of the microscopic
step of fibril elongation observed here and previously54 is consistent with the hypothesis that binding
between TTR molecules and Aβ40 monomers, if present,
is not significant in determining the kinetics of Aβ40 fibril formation. Hence, the ability of WT-TTR or M-TTR to inhibit
primary nucleation cannot be attributed to their ability to sequester
Aβ40 monomers from the formation of nuclei competent
for growth and elongation. Both WT-TTR and M-TTR can, however, bind
Aβ40 oligomeric species with high affinity,5−8 suggesting that both forms of TTR can bind to the Aβ40 oligomeric species formed in the aggregation process, preventing
their structural reorganization into species that are able to elongate
(Figure 3e). Moreover,
this conclusion is consistent with (i) the observation made in this
study with AFM that M-TTR can stabilize oligomeric Aβ40, (ii) with the recent finding that M-TTR can bind to oligomers and
block their conversion into fibrils,9 and
(iii) with the previous finding that WT-TTR can bind to oligomers
that are positive for the OC antibody and block their growth, maturation,
or reorganization;8 indeed, such OC-positive
oligomers have been shown to be off-pathway species, thus unproductive
for fibril elongation.55 Indeed, such off-pathway
intermediates would be expected to dissociate more slowly than the
overall time scale of the aggregation reaction, and further studies
are needed to address the metastability of the TTR-bound oligomers.
Overall, blockage of primary nucleation does not arise in this case
from monomer sequestration but by interaction with oligomeric species
and inhibition of their conversion and growth into nuclei.

The
lack of effect on Aβ40 fibril elongation indicates
that TTR molecules do not bind strongly to the growing ends of Aβ40 fibrils. By contrast, a significant effect on secondary
nucleation was observed under conditions of saturation of the Aβ40 binding sites on fibril surfaces, in agreement again with
the concept that the various forms of TTR hinder the conversion of
fibril-bound Aβ40 oligomers into species able to
elongate. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for TTR,
as well as extracellular chaperones, in the binding of protein-misfolded
oligomers and inhibition of their toxicity, including “binding
followed by further oligomer clustering” and “binding
causing hydrophobic shielding”.56 Both of these mechanisms have indeed been observed for M-TTR and
toxic HypF-N or Aβ42 oligomers at particular protein:protein
molar ratios.8,9,13,57 The AFM results reported here indicate that
M-TTR can stabilize the smaller Aβ40 oligomers, as
well as induce the formation of larger Aβ40 assemblies,
consistent with these two views.

In our conditions of analysis,
M-TTR was found to be less effective
than WT-TTR in inhibiting Aβ40 fibril formation,
in apparent disagreement with an earlier report under similar conditions.7 The difference can be due to subtle differences
in experimental conditions, as well as in differences in TTR and Aβ40 protein purification.

### M-TTR Undergoes a Subtle
Conformational Change When Interacting
with Aβ Oligomers

M-TTR has been shown to be very plastic,
with conformational changes occurring as the pH decreases to values
of 3.9–5.0,58 upon the addition
of small amounts of urea at equilibrium before the major unfolding
transition at pH 7.437 and transiently
during folding from the fully unfolded to the fully folded state at
pH 7.4.37 The data presented here suggest
that M-TTR undergoes a subtle conformational change when interacting
with Aβ40 and Aβ42 oligomers. Far-UV
CD indicates that M-TTR maintains its secondary structure and overall
topology, but fluorescence measurements reveal that it undergoes subtle
changes in conformation, as indicated by small enhancements in tryptophan
fluorescence and increases in the average spatial distances between
the tryptophan residues, particularly Trp41, and the fluorophore attached
to Cys10. Thus, following interaction with Aβ40 oligomers
forming during amyloid fibril formation and stable Aβ42 ADDLs, the FRET efficiency decreases from 0.72 ± 0.02 to 0.60
± 0.03 and 0.57 ± 0.03, respectively, a change that is less
dramatic than that observed upon full unfolding of M-TTR for the same
donor–acceptor pair, where the change is from 0.72 ± 0.02
to 0.29 ± 0.01.31

This conformational
state is distinct from other partially folded or native-like states
observed previously. In fact, the amyloidogenic state of M-TTR at
pH 3.9–5.0 has the same secondary structure and Trp-DACM FRET
efficiency as the native state.31 The conformational
state populated in 1 M urea at pH 7.4 has a far-UV CD spectrum distinct
from that of the native structure, indicating some degree of unfolding,
but indistinguishable fluorescence properties, including similar FRET E values.31,37 Finally, the kinetic folding
intermediate at pH 7.4 has a higher FRET efficiency than, and a similar
β-sheet content to, the native state, again showing a distinction
from the species characterized here.31,37 Such a variety
of partially folded states adopted by M-TTR under the various circumstances
emphasizes the structural plasticity of this protein.

### How Does TTR
Prevent Aβ Fibril Formation and Toxicity
in Vivo?

The concentration of WT-TTR is estimated to be 0.09–0.36
μM in the human CSF of healthy individuals.59 WT-TTR is also present in the neurons and brain parenchyma,
although its concentration in these environments has not yet been
determined.11 By contrast, the concentration
of Aβ40 in the CSF of healthy individuals is 0.6–5.0
nM60 and has been determined to be in the
high picomolar to low nanomolar range in the human brain,5,61,62 where the concentration of Aβ42 is even lower.60 The interaction
between WT-TTR and monomeric Aβ40 occurring in solution
has been studied previously7,10 and reported to have
a KD value of 435 ± 19 μM,
using Trp41 intrinsic fluorescence quenching by Aβ40,10 or 24 μM, using solution NMR
and isothermal titration calorimetry.7 With
these protein concentrations and affinities, therefore, only a small
fraction of monomeric Aβ40 is likely to be associated
with tetrameric WT-TTR, i.e., ca. 0.4–1.5% in the CSF, assuming
a KD value of 24 μM.7 A similar order of magnitude (or even lower) is expected
in the brain parenchyma, and the situation for monomeric Aβ42 is likely to be very similar. Although quantitatively negligible,
however, it cannot be excluded that the binding of monomeric Aβ40/Aβ42 to tetrameric TTR can become significant
in some circumstances.7

The most
effective mechanism inhibiting amyloid fibril formation by Aβ40 and Aβ42 in vivo is likely to be the interaction
between WT-TTR (or its dissociated subunits) and Aβ40 or Aβ42 oligomers. It is still unclear whether
WT-TTR binds the Aβ oligomers in its tetrameric form7 or only after dissociation into its constituent
subunits.8 The affinity of WT-TTR and M-TTR
for oligomeric Aβ is much higher than that of monomers.5−9 Consequently, such binding can be an effective strategy through
which TTR inhibits both Aβ fibril formation (by blocking the
conversion of small-sized oligomers into small fibrils through primary
and secondary nucleations) and reducing the toxicity of the oligomers
(Figure 3e). This latter
mechanism of neuroprotection mediated by TTR has been widely described
previously7,11−13 and has been confirmed
in the present study. The former mechanism is as important as the
latter, however, because it is increasingly recognized that the proliferation
of protein aggregates can be dominated by secondary nucleation on
the surfaces of fibrils42,45 and that the spread
of protein deposition diseases through the brain may result from the
diffusion of fibrils.63,64

### Conclusions

TTR
is increasingly recognized to act as an Aβ scavenger
in the brain, as indicated by the increased levels of this protein
in the CSF during aging,16 the expression
of TTR in the heat shock response in neurons,21 the concomitant reduction in the level of Aβ and TTR in the
CSF in AD,16,18 and the colocalization of the
two proteins in the senile plaques of the cortex and hippocampus in
AD.11 In fact, it seems that TTR is upregulated
as a result of aging, stress, and as a means of protection against
the aggregates of Aβ40/Aβ42 in the
brain and that it follows the fate of the CSF pool of Aβ. In
this study, we have shown that an important mechanism of this protective
role lies in the ability of TTR to bind to Aβ oligomers and
inhibit their conversion into the short fibrils, as both the microscopic
steps of primary and secondary nucleations are retarded. This protection,
which has been observed to require a subtle conformational conversion
of TTR, is dual as it limits both the toxicity of the oligomeric species
and the ability of the aggregates to proliferate over time.
