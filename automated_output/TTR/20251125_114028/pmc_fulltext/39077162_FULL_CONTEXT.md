## Genotype-Phenotype Associations with Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Induced by Pathogenic Genetic Mutations

### Abstract

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is an uncommon cardiac muscle disease 
characterized by impaired ventricular filling and severe diastolic dysfunction 
with or without systolic dysfunction. The patients with RCM present poor 
prognosis and high prevalence of sudden cardiac death, especially in the young. 
The etiology of RCM may be idiopathic, familial or acquired predispositions from 
various systemic diseases. The genetic background of familial RCM is often caused 
by mutations in genes encoding proteins of sarcomeres and a significant minority 
by mutations in non-sarcomeric proteins and transthyretin proteins. It is 
important to identify the associations between genotype and phenotype to guide 
clinical diagnosis and treatment. Here, we have summarized the reported index 
cases with RCM involving genetic etiology to date and highlighted the most 
significant phenotype results.

### 1. Introduction

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least frequently encountered form of 
cardiac muscle disease, which increases myocardial stiffness and results in 
impaired ventricular filling [1, 2]. RCM should be classified as either primary 
or secondary according to underlying etiology [3]. The hallmark of RCM is 
diastolic dysfunction in the presence of normal or near-normal systolic function, 
ventricular volumes and wall thickness, at least at the beginning of disease [4]. 
Consequently, the systolic function might deteriorate at later stages of the 
disease [5]. Patients with RCM may present signs of left or right heart failure. 
Right-sided symptoms often predominate, such as peripheral edema and ascites. 
However, there is a worse prognosis when the left ventricle is affected or 
ventricular arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are encountered [4, 6]. 
Pharmacological therapy and heart failure management for RCM show limited 
efficacy to improve ventricular filling or prolong survival [7]. Although therapy 
is unsatisfactory, early and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve symptom 
and survival [4, 7]. The correct diagnosis depends on the distinction between RCM 
and constrictive pericarditis, which share similar clinical presentations and 
physical findings [8, 9]. But their pathophysiological mechanism and prognosis 
differ significantly [10].

RCM may be idiopathic, familial, acquired predispositions from various systemic 
diseases or a combination of them [2]. Some familial cases presenting genetically 
determined etiology are often associated with autosomal dominant inheritance or 
X-linked inheritance [11]. Although familial RCM caused by a single genetic 
defect is rare in clinical practice, mapping several specific disease-causing 
genetic mutations resulting in RCM has been recognized [12]. The genetic 
mutations associated with the occurrence and progression of RCM involve sarcomere 
proteins, such as troponin I (TNNI3), troponin T (TNNT2), 
β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and α-actin 
(ACTC1) [13, 14, 15]. The patients with RCM owing to sarcomere gene mutations 
may be accompanied with or without similar microscopic features of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) [16, 17]. It used to be considered that RCM and HCM may 
represent a different phenotype of the same genetic disease [16]. A key piece of 
evidence was the coexistence of an RCM phenotypic expression with mutations in 
the HCM-related genes [18]. Other non-sarcomeric gene mutations, including 
myopalladin (MYPN) and titin (TTN), and infiltrative 
RCM-associated mutations have also been identified in RCM recently [11, 19].

This article focuses on heritable genetic mutations and genotype-phenotype 
associations with familial RCM, as shown in Table 1 (Ref. [11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]). The risk stratification and clinical treatment of RCM 
patients could be affected and improved depending on the systematic databases of 
genetic alterations.

### 2. Sarcomeres and Cardiomyopathies

Cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), as the structure of myocardium tissue, 
are composed of parallel bundles of myofibrils with a diameter of about 1 
μm. And single myofibril comprises ordered sarcomeres in series, acting as 
the smallest contractile units of striated muscle [49, 50]. In cardiac muscle 
cells, sarcomeres, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) account for 
approximately 60%, 35%, and 5% of the volume, respectively [50].

The sarcomeres are defined as regions residing between the Z-lines (also known 
as Z-disks or Z-bands) based on the electron-optical properties and structural 
components [51]. The sarcomeres consist of an A-band flanked by two half I-bands 
as the central region. The A-band is anisotropic due to parallel aligned thick 
filaments composed of myosin. The myosin is a hexameric protein including two 
heavy chains and four light chains. Each myosin molecule contains two myosin 
“heads”, which are associated with two light chains, respectively, and make a 
total of four light chains [52]. The myosin “heads” are recognized to reveal 
the active site for ATP hydrolysis, with which myosin motor proteins produce a 
force on actin filaments [53]. The I-band on each side of the A-band is nearly 
isotropic composed of actin and its associated proteins due to thinner and less 
well-aligned filaments (called thin filaments) [54, 55]. It is well known that 
the interaction of filamentous actin with myosin is the basis of muscle 
contraction [56]. The actin, with monomeric (G-actin) polymerized and filamentous 
(F-actin) states, is the most abundant and highly conserved protein in most 
eukaryotic cells [57, 58]. G-actin proteins polymerize into long F-actin in the 
presence of Mg2+ and K+ at a physiological ionic concentration to form 
a tight helix. The length stabilization of actin cannot be achieved until the 
addition of capping proteins to block monomer loss [59]. In addition to the actin 
backbone, the thin filaments include other two major proteins, tropomyosin (Tm) 
and troponin (Tn), which are also recognized as significant components regulating 
the contractile and diastolic system of striated muscle together [60]. Tm is an 
elongated α-helix molecule that assembles into the parallel dimeric 
coiled-coil. In response to the binding of a distinct thin filament effector, the 
Tm moves to a precise location on the actin’s surface to exert its biological 
activities [61, 62]. Each Tm molecule spans seven actin subunits. A tremendous 
effort has been made to dissect how Tm proteins transmit the binding event from a 
single actin monomer to other defined actin monomers according to an accurate 
activation of actin filaments [63, 64, 65, 66]. The Tn complex consists of three subunits, 
including Troponin I (inhibitory, TnI), troponin C (calcium-binding, TnC) and 
troponin T (tropomyosin binding, TnT) proteins [67]. TnI, binding to actin and 
Tm, functions as an inhibitory subunit to prevent muscle contract without 
Ca2+ binding to TnC, which confers Ca2+ sensitivity to the regulatory 
system. The elongated TnT molecule binds to Tm and interacts between Tm, actin 
and the rest of the Tn complex, likely modulating the actomyosin ATPase activity 
[68]. The Tn-Tm complex prevents actin-myosin interactions when the muscle cells 
are in a state of rest. Conformational changes in the Tn proteins caused by 
Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum enable myosin to bind to actin 
[51, 69]. These highly ordered sarcomere proteins’ exact structure and relative 
position are crucial in normal physiological functions, including heart muscle 
contraction.

The cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton mainly consists of highly ordered sarcomeres 
referring to myosin-actin and titin filaments (also described as connectin) [70]. 
The cytoskeleton acts as a sensitive and dynamic cellular organizer and effector 
rather than a static skeleton responding to extracellular signals. The titin 
filament, a giant molecular spring and scaffold in cardiomyocytes, spans from the 
Z-line with NH2 terminus over the half I-band and thick filament to M-line, the 
centre of sarcomere [71]. Titin protein is potentially expressed in millions of 
various isoforms of different lengths due to differential splicing within the 
region of titin located in the I-band from the transcript [72, 73]. Cardiac titin 
consists of an N2-B segment between the proximal and distal immunoglobulin (Ig) 
domains and might not match a complementary N2-A component. Therefore, the 
cardiac titin isoforms are mainly classified as N2-B (3000 kDa in the absence of 
N2-A) or N2-BA (>3200 kDa at variable sizes in the presence of N2-A) [74, 75]. 
The expression of titin isoforms in the sarcomere differs according to the 
species, location and developmental period [76]. The cardiomyocyte compliance is 
determined by N2-BA/N2-B ratio because the long titin isoform is more compliant 
than the short one. The normal N2-BA/N2-B expression ratio in the hearts of many 
adult mammalians, including humans, is approximately 35:65 [77]. There will be 
less stiffness and resistance to stretching when more N2-BA prevalent [78]. 
Moreover, oxidation can also affect titin compliance. It had been reported that 
increased oxidant stress could elevate the stiffness of cardiomyocytes 
contributing to the global heart stiffening. That is why the aging or failing 
heart is less compliant [79].

Cardiomyopathies are defined as diseases of the myocardium related to cardiac 
dysfunction [80], ranging from lifelong symptomless conditions to 
life-threatening symptoms, including progressive heart failure, different 
arrhythmias and even sudden cardiac death. Some cardiomyopathies may be 
idiopathic or familial/genetic/inherited etiology. The genetic studies involving 
disease-causing mutations suggested that pathological variations in the sarcomere 
gene played a central role in inherited cardiomyopathies [81]. Several lines of 
evidence supported that the so-called “disease of the sarcomere” is highly 
associated with initiation and even different clinical phenotypes of RCM [3]. The 
observation that the familial occurrence of RCM had long been established firstly 
attracted attention to its genetic background [82].

### 3. Sarcomeric Gene Mutations

The genetic basis of RCM is largely attributed to mutations in the sarcomeric 
complex. The main mutations are summarized as follows.

TnI has evolved into three isoforms in higher vertebrates, encoded by three 
related genes: TNNI1, TNNI2 and TNNI3. Cardiac TnI 
(cTnI) in the adult is specifically expressed and regulated by TNNI3, 
slow and fast skeletal muscle cells by TNNI1 and TNNI2, 
respectively [83]. In the human chromosomal genome, TNNI3 is located at 
19q13.4, encoding approximately 210 amino acids residues with a molecular weight 
of 24.0 kDa [84]. The functional domain in cTnI between residues from 61 to 112 
binds TnT. The inhibitory domain, including residues from 147 to 163, bind 
strongly to actin and the N-terminal of TnC. It is necessary for regulating the 
connection of Ca2+ to TnC and actomyosin ATPase activity [85, 86]. A second 
actin-binding site, residues 168 to 188 of cTnI, binds specifically to the 
actin-tropomyosin filament contributing to the inhibitory activity of cTnI [87]. 
The C-terminal domain in cTnI is specific and crucial for normal cardiac 
relaxation. In addition, the remaining C-terminal part residues from 192 to 210 
are not fully identified. Still, they are suspected of playing a significant role 
in stabilizing the Ca2+-activated state of tropomyosin in the actin 
filaments [88].

Most RCM-associated mutations in TNNI3 are generally missense rather 
than frameshift or splice mutations. It has been described that a c.87A>G 
nucleotide substitution in exon 8 of TNNI3 identified by linkage 
analysis and direct gene sequencing was highly correlated with marked restrictive 
filling and a family history of sudden cardiac death [17]. The index case of 
familial occurrence with RCM involved a proband who suffered from severe heart 
failure at the age of 11. Subsequent investigation in this study revealed that 
six missense variants were associated with RCM-related specific genetic 
mutations: p.D190H, p.R192H, p.K178E, p.R145W, p.A171T and p.L144Q [17]. These 
mutations largely increase the myofibril sensitivity to Ca2+ and affect the 
basal and maximal actomyosin ATPase activity [89, 90]. The worst clinical 
phenotypes involved p.K178E and p.R192H resulting in significant increases in 
Ca2+ sensitivity [90]. According to the echocardiography results of a 
p.R193H transgenic mouse model, there were significantly reduced left ventricular 
end-diastolic volumes compared with the wild-type group [91]. Moreover, p.R193H 
mutant of TNNI3 in adult rat cardiac myocytes further dissected that the 
increased basal mechanical force cannot be explained by a gain of myofibril 
Ca2+ sensitivity. It was inferred that the TnI-based disinhibition in 
actin-myosin interaction at normal diastolic Ca2+ concentration contributed 
to the cellular defect of TNNI3 p.R193H mutation. This 
Ca2+-independent mechanical force was blocked by chronic inhibition of the 
interaction between actin and myosin proteins [92]. Another heterozygous p.R204H 
mutation in exon 8 of TNNI3 was identified in a young female patient 
with pure RCM who had undergone heart transplantation at the age of 23 [20]. The 
specific mechanism of how p.R204H mutation induces primary RCM is still unclear, 
although the phenotype and clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. Additionally, 
two novel disease-causing p.L144H and p.R170Q missense mutations, both present in 
exon 7 of TNNI3, were found in a family with four affected patients and 
a single unrelated patient essentially associated with RCM [21]. The p.L144H 
mutation was located in the first actin-binding domain and overlapped with the 
ATPase inhibitory domain. The p.R170Q mutation was located in the second 
actin-binding domain [93]. These mutations within the actin-binding domain have 
been presented to cause excessive inhibition in troponin I actomyosin ATPase 
activity [86]. Some studies at the laboratory suggest that these mutations could 
weaken the ability of the troponin complex to sufficiently inhibit the 
cross-bridge attachment when muscle cells are at the relaxation phase, which 
significantly decreased the rate of muscle relaxation [94, 95]. The change costs 
higher energy to return to the pre-contractile basal state [21]. Furthermore, a 
pathogenic p.P150S in exon 7 of TNNI3 responsible for RCM was confirmed 
in a Chinese family [22]. This mutation is in the actin and the N-terminal of the 
TnC binding domain where the configuration of cTnC and cTnI returns to the status 
before constriction and cTnI binds to actin again as a consequence of decreased 
Ca2+ concentration. However, the process fails to complete once mutation 
occurs in this domain, such as p.P150S, resulting in impaired diastolic filling 
in patients with RCM.

Besides missense mutations, deletion mutations in TNNI3 are also 
responsible for the development of RCM in a tiny percentage of patients. A novel 
deletion mutation of two nucleotides g.4789_4790delAA in exon 7 of 
TNNI3 was identified in RCM individual [23]. This mutation contributed 
to a frameshift and the presence of a premature termination codon at amino acid 
site 209 (E177fsX209). Another index patient diagnosed with RCM at the age of 23 
and died due to progression of congestive heart failure at the age of 28 
indicated a deletion of one nucleotide g.4762delG in exon 7 of TNNI3. 
This deletion also induced a frameshift in residue 168 and the introduction of a 
premature termination codon at site 176 (D168fsX176) [24]. According to 
laboratory tests, this mutation resulted in the truncation of the C-terminal part 
of cTnI and an approximate 50% decrease in total cTnI, likely leading to a 
nearly total deficiency of the second actin TnC binding domain. The damage of the 
inhibitory effect of the Tn-Tm complex on thin filaments could cause impaired 
myocardium relaxation and restrictive filling [24].

Collectively, the integrity of the cTnI is essential for conformation of the Tn 
complex in myofilament and the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. To 
dissect the pathogenic cellular mechanisms resulting from TNNI3 
mutations to identify the cause of RCM is scientifically and clinically 
important.

TNNT2 gene encodes the Tm-binding subunit of the Tn complex in the 
heart, which acts as a regulator of striated muscle contraction in response to 
differential intracellular Ca2+ concentration [96]. It is well established 
that the association between pathogenic TNNT2 mutations and risk of 
cardiomyopathies [25].

The first case of RCM caused by a de novo mutation of TNNT2 
was reported in a 12-month-old girl [97]. This infantile case had experienced 
recurrent episodes of sinus bradycardia and tachycardia, malignant ventricular 
arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability. She received extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation therapy, followed by a biventricular assist device insertion and 
subsequently underwent heart transplantation [97]. Genetic testing revealed a 
novel deletion mutation c.285_287GGA in exon 9 of TNNT2, resulting in 
deletion of glutamine in 96 amino acid residual (p.96delE). The p.96delE mutation 
is located in the highly conserved domain. It induces the deficiency of a 
negative charge in the coiled-coil region, affecting the TnT-Tm-actin complex’s 
interactions [98]. Following experimental results demonstrated that p.96delE 
mutation significantly increased the Ca2+ sensitivity in fibres 
reconstituted with the adult and fetal TnT isoforms. However, the effect was 
enhanced in adult Tn protein [99]. Another heterozygous in-frame double deletion 
mutation (c.297-302AATGAG) in exon 9 of TNNT2 was reported in an RCM 
pediatric patient. That led to the deletion of asparagine and glutamic acid, two 
highly conserved amino acids, at positions 100 and 101, respectively 
(p.100-101delNE) [26]. This case’s clinical condition deteriorated rapidly with 
frequent chest pain and dyspnea, and the patient ultimately received a heart 
transplant 15 months after initial presentations. Histology indicated mild muscle 
hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and disarray of the myocytes. It must be 
mentioned that those observations revealed a certain overlap of restrictive and 
hypertrophic phenotypes that coexisted in this RCM case.

Some missense mutations proved to be associated with RCM. In a large family with 
autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, the c.236T>A missense mutation in exon 8 of 
TNNT2 led to the substitution of isoleucine (I) with asparagine (N) at 
amino acid position 79 (p.I79N) [13]. RCM caused by this mutation often 
complicated massive biatrial enlargement, markedly abnormal diastolic function, 
subsequent sinus bradycardia and progression to complete heart block, and even 
needed radiofrequency ablation and pacemaker/cardioverter-defibrillator 
implantation therapy in some patients. A transgenic mice model with targeted 
human cTnT (TNNT2 p.I79N) protein expression showed enhanced 
calcium-activated force generation and ATPase activity without muscle 
hypertrophy. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from TnC during diastole 
decreases, and the baseline muscle tension increases, resulting in slower 
relaxation, the elevation of end-diastolic pressure and subsequent diastolic 
heart failure [100, 101]. Another index RCM case induced by a novel nucleotide 
substitution g.9718G>A in exon 10 of TNNT2 was associated with myocyte 
vacuolation according to the histology of proband’s explanted heart. This 
disorder is commonly observed in TnT-mutation related cardiomyopathy [23, 27]. 
The underlying pathogenicity of this new variant remains to be elucidated.

Therefore, the identified TNNT2 mutations, such as p.100-101delNE and 
p.I79N, associated with RCM often occur in a TnT binding fragment corresponding 
to residues 70–170 in the N-terminal domain. This finding suggests the existence 
of a mutational hotspot region in TNNT2 where mutations may result in 
impaired Tm-dependent functions of cTnT [102].

Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) consists of two globular EF-hand (the most common 
calcium-binding motif) domains and a flexible linker. The calcium-sensing part of 
the Tn complex is troponin C encoded by TNNC1 in both cardiac muscle and 
slow skeletal muscle. There are two high-affinity calcium-binding sites in the 
C-domain of cTnC where are often occupied by Ca2+ in physiologic conditions 
[103].

Previously, mutations in TNNC1 have been associated with HCM or DCM. 
Nowadays, the evidence indicated that a compound heterozygous mutation p.A8V 
(c.C23T) and p.D145E (c.C435A) in TNNC1 inducing fatal RCM was described 
in a pediatric proband who inherited the mutation from her unaffected paternal 
grandmother and maternal grandfather, respectively [28]. The younger sister of 
this proband, who carried the same genetic background, initially showed 
congenital HCM, evolved to RCM, subsequently occurred with heart failure and 
death. This phenomenon suggests that RCM induced by the compound heterozygosity 
p.A8V and p.D145E is combined with a young-onset marked restrictive physiology, 
familial history of sudden cardiac death and gradually evolves into septal 
hypertrophy. The p.A8V mutation alone caused a more open cTnC N-domain 
conformation, presumably increasing interactions with the switch region of cTnI 
[104], while the p.D145E mutation altered Ca2+ bind by the C-domain of cTnC 
[105]. It appeared not compatible with the fact that the grandparents of the 
proband who carried single p.A8V or p.D145E allele were unaffected. The seemingly 
contrasting finding might be explained by the possibility that the single 
mutation was haploinsufficiency to cause a complete penetrance. However, the 
combination of compound heterozygotes p.A8V and p.D145E resulted in a more severe 
phenotype of RCM. Experimental results demonstrated that the major abnormality 
induced by p.A8V and p.D145E mutations at the same time was the decreased Ca2+ off-rate, altered muscle relaxation and impairing diastolic function [106, 107].

As described above, myosin is a hexameric contractile protein containing two 
heavy chains (MHC, encoded by MYH7 in the heart) associated with four 
light chains (MLC). The four MLCs are classified as two regulatory light chains 
(encoded by MYL2 in the heart) and two essential light chains (encoded 
by MYL3 in the heart). The C-terminal part of each MHC is α 
helical, whereas its N-terminal part folds into a globular head region called 
subfragment 1 (S1). The S1 contains a motor domain binding to actin. It 
hydrolyses ATP and a neck domain composed of a regulatory and essential light 
chain, respectively, functioning as a lever for filament sliding in contraction 
[108, 109].

A de novo heterozygous mutation p.P838L was firstly identified in 
MYH7 in an infantile RCM case. The clinical presentation of this proband 
was characterized by early-onset, mild hypertrophy of the left ventricle and a 
very short evolution to death [14]. The p.P838L mutation is located in an 
extremely conserved hinge segment between the rod region and the globular head 
region of myosin protein. The marked restrictive physiology might result from the 
myosin head region’s impaired flexion during the relaxation cycle. However, in a 
p.P838L myosin transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model, the heart morphology and 
cardiac function was normal, although the p.P838L mutant myosin increased basal 
ATPase, actin sliding velocity, rotational flexibility and the average angle of 
two heads in vitro  [110]. On the one hand, the seemingly different 
findings might result from the possibility that Drosophila myosin protein is less 
sensitive to the p.P838L perturbation than humans. On the other hand, the 
identification of the human pathogenic mutations involved sequencing of select 
candidate genes. Hence, it is possible that a mutation in another genetic locus, 
alone or in conjunction with P838L myosin, is responsible for the severe 
phenotype observed in the human patients [110]. Another missense mutation, p.G768R 
in exon 21 of MYH7, also was found in a pediatric RCM case [29]. The 
p.G768R locates in a highly conserved region across species and has previously 
been reported as a disease-causing mutation associated in adults with HCM [111]. 
It suggests that the phenotypic manifestations of MYH7 mutations in 
children, especially young ones, are different from adult ones. Further 
investigations are needed to determine whether other untested genetic mutations 
or sensitive indicators functioned as potential contributors to the severity and 
age of onset. A novel MYH7 p.R721K mutation was found in an RCM proband, 
who died at 47-year old due to progressive congestive heart failure, and her 
young son both showed biatrial enlargement, normal wall thickness and restrictive 
features. Yet, her other non-carrier son did not have these features [30]. The 
p.R721K mutation located in the converter domain of MYH7 affects 
myosin’s ATPase activity. RCM induced by MYH7 mutation in this domain is 
associated with severe diastolic heart failure, high rates of atrial 
fibrillation, stroke, poor prognosis and even sudden cardiac death [30]. Another 
p.Y386C mutation was reported in exon 13 of MYH7, which was previously 
seen in an infant with de novo HCM by the laboratory. The index case 
died at the age of 18 months, and the autopsy findings presented RCM, not HCM 
[31]. Interestingly, this is the first observation in a patient with RCM 
overlapped myocardial bridging under an MYH7 mutant background.

RCM caused by MLC-related mutation was firstly reported in an El-Salvadoran 
22-year-old female. The patient underwent recurrent syncope and severe heart 
failure [32]. There were homozygous mutations of MYL3 p.E143K 
(c.427G>A), combined with a novel heterozygous mutation of MYL2 p.G57E 
(c.170G>A). Her mother, who carried a double heterozygous MYL3 p.E143K 
and MYL2 p.G57E, showed a normal echocardiogram and electrocardiogram 
examinations. According to this phenomenon, the homozygous MYL3 p.E143K 
was highly considered to contribute to RCM in the proband [32].

The α-tropomyosin is encoded by TPM1 and plays a crucial role 
in actin regulation and stability, participating in fundamental functions in 
heart development. Mutations in TPM1 cause dominantly inherited 
cardiomyopathies [112]. Almost all recently reported TPM1 variants are 
missense mutations that resulted in a single amino acid substitution.

A novel homozygous missense mutation TPM1 p.N279H (c.835A>C) was 
found in an Italian RCM case. The endomyocardial biopsy showed mild myocyte 
hypertrophy and no evidence of amyloid or iron deposition [32]. This proband’s 
father carried heterozygous p.N279H mutation and was diagnosed with HCM in the 
absence of restrictive physiology. In 2021, the compound heterozygous 
TPM1 variants p.E62Q (c.184G>C) and p.M281T (c.842T>C) were 
identified in a child with RCM for the first time [33]. This proband was 
diagnosed with RCM at the age of 6, received orthotopic heart transplantation at 
12-year old, and reached adult age without cardiovascular events. In addition, 
the family members of the proband carrying one of these two mutations presented 
HCM phenotypes. Following tests suggested that TPM1 mutations resulted 
in time-dependent and progressive deterioration of cardiomyocyte CaT amplitudes. 
Yet, the reduced CaT amplitudes and the deficient sarcomeric structures are 
independent of the TPM1 mutations and the clinical phenotypes of 
cardiomyopathies [33].

Actin is a highly conserved protein and encoded by ACTC1. 
Mutations in this gene have been phenotypically associated with various cardiac 
abnormalities. A novel p.D313H mutation (g.4642G>C) in exon 5 of ACTC1 
was observed in an individual with RCM [23]. Interestingly, the proband’s father 
died from DCM after heart transplantation and the older sister was diagnosed with 
overlapping phenotypes of RCM and DCM. The p.D313H was located in the immobilized 
region of the actin filament, acting as an important tropomyosin-binding site 
[113]. The specific mechanism by how the p.D313H mutation induced various clinical 
phenotypes of cardiomyopathy remains unclear.

The MYBPC3 gene encodes the cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein C 
(MyBPC), a myosin-associated and large multi-domain protein. The role of MyBPC in 
the sarcomere regulation is not yet fully understood. Previously, MYBPC3 
mutations were demonstrated highly related to familial HCM [114]. However, a 
nonsense mutation MYBPC3 p.Q463X (c.1387C>T) was identified in a 
multigenerational family with three adult RCM patients. Moreover, another 
missense mutation MYBPC3 p.E334K (c.1000G>A) was observed in an 
unrelated patient [34]. A zebrafish model with genetic knockdown of 
MYBPC3 showed ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic heart failure 
manifestations, including decreased diastolic relaxation velocity, pericardial 
effusion and dilatation of the atrium [115]. It is noted that primary RCM caused 
by MYBPC3 mutation is associated with severe diastolic dysfunction, yet 
the long-term prognosis is still obscure [34].

### 3.1 TNNI3 Mutations

TnI has evolved into three isoforms in higher vertebrates, encoded by three 
related genes: TNNI1, TNNI2 and TNNI3. Cardiac TnI 
(cTnI) in the adult is specifically expressed and regulated by TNNI3, 
slow and fast skeletal muscle cells by TNNI1 and TNNI2, 
respectively [83]. In the human chromosomal genome, TNNI3 is located at 
19q13.4, encoding approximately 210 amino acids residues with a molecular weight 
of 24.0 kDa [84]. The functional domain in cTnI between residues from 61 to 112 
binds TnT. The inhibitory domain, including residues from 147 to 163, bind 
strongly to actin and the N-terminal of TnC. It is necessary for regulating the 
connection of Ca2+ to TnC and actomyosin ATPase activity [85, 86]. A second 
actin-binding site, residues 168 to 188 of cTnI, binds specifically to the 
actin-tropomyosin filament contributing to the inhibitory activity of cTnI [87]. 
The C-terminal domain in cTnI is specific and crucial for normal cardiac 
relaxation. In addition, the remaining C-terminal part residues from 192 to 210 
are not fully identified. Still, they are suspected of playing a significant role 
in stabilizing the Ca2+-activated state of tropomyosin in the actin 
filaments [88].

Most RCM-associated mutations in TNNI3 are generally missense rather 
than frameshift or splice mutations. It has been described that a c.87A>G 
nucleotide substitution in exon 8 of TNNI3 identified by linkage 
analysis and direct gene sequencing was highly correlated with marked restrictive 
filling and a family history of sudden cardiac death [17]. The index case of 
familial occurrence with RCM involved a proband who suffered from severe heart 
failure at the age of 11. Subsequent investigation in this study revealed that 
six missense variants were associated with RCM-related specific genetic 
mutations: p.D190H, p.R192H, p.K178E, p.R145W, p.A171T and p.L144Q [17]. These 
mutations largely increase the myofibril sensitivity to Ca2+ and affect the 
basal and maximal actomyosin ATPase activity [89, 90]. The worst clinical 
phenotypes involved p.K178E and p.R192H resulting in significant increases in 
Ca2+ sensitivity [90]. According to the echocardiography results of a 
p.R193H transgenic mouse model, there were significantly reduced left ventricular 
end-diastolic volumes compared with the wild-type group [91]. Moreover, p.R193H 
mutant of TNNI3 in adult rat cardiac myocytes further dissected that the 
increased basal mechanical force cannot be explained by a gain of myofibril 
Ca2+ sensitivity. It was inferred that the TnI-based disinhibition in 
actin-myosin interaction at normal diastolic Ca2+ concentration contributed 
to the cellular defect of TNNI3 p.R193H mutation. This 
Ca2+-independent mechanical force was blocked by chronic inhibition of the 
interaction between actin and myosin proteins [92]. Another heterozygous p.R204H 
mutation in exon 8 of TNNI3 was identified in a young female patient 
with pure RCM who had undergone heart transplantation at the age of 23 [20]. The 
specific mechanism of how p.R204H mutation induces primary RCM is still unclear, 
although the phenotype and clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. Additionally, 
two novel disease-causing p.L144H and p.R170Q missense mutations, both present in 
exon 7 of TNNI3, were found in a family with four affected patients and 
a single unrelated patient essentially associated with RCM [21]. The p.L144H 
mutation was located in the first actin-binding domain and overlapped with the 
ATPase inhibitory domain. The p.R170Q mutation was located in the second 
actin-binding domain [93]. These mutations within the actin-binding domain have 
been presented to cause excessive inhibition in troponin I actomyosin ATPase 
activity [86]. Some studies at the laboratory suggest that these mutations could 
weaken the ability of the troponin complex to sufficiently inhibit the 
cross-bridge attachment when muscle cells are at the relaxation phase, which 
significantly decreased the rate of muscle relaxation [94, 95]. The change costs 
higher energy to return to the pre-contractile basal state [21]. Furthermore, a 
pathogenic p.P150S in exon 7 of TNNI3 responsible for RCM was confirmed 
in a Chinese family [22]. This mutation is in the actin and the N-terminal of the 
TnC binding domain where the configuration of cTnC and cTnI returns to the status 
before constriction and cTnI binds to actin again as a consequence of decreased 
Ca2+ concentration. However, the process fails to complete once mutation 
occurs in this domain, such as p.P150S, resulting in impaired diastolic filling 
in patients with RCM.

Besides missense mutations, deletion mutations in TNNI3 are also 
responsible for the development of RCM in a tiny percentage of patients. A novel 
deletion mutation of two nucleotides g.4789_4790delAA in exon 7 of 
TNNI3 was identified in RCM individual [23]. This mutation contributed 
to a frameshift and the presence of a premature termination codon at amino acid 
site 209 (E177fsX209). Another index patient diagnosed with RCM at the age of 23 
and died due to progression of congestive heart failure at the age of 28 
indicated a deletion of one nucleotide g.4762delG in exon 7 of TNNI3. 
This deletion also induced a frameshift in residue 168 and the introduction of a 
premature termination codon at site 176 (D168fsX176) [24]. According to 
laboratory tests, this mutation resulted in the truncation of the C-terminal part 
of cTnI and an approximate 50% decrease in total cTnI, likely leading to a 
nearly total deficiency of the second actin TnC binding domain. The damage of the 
inhibitory effect of the Tn-Tm complex on thin filaments could cause impaired 
myocardium relaxation and restrictive filling [24].

Collectively, the integrity of the cTnI is essential for conformation of the Tn 
complex in myofilament and the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. To 
dissect the pathogenic cellular mechanisms resulting from TNNI3 
mutations to identify the cause of RCM is scientifically and clinically 
important.

### 3.2 TNNT2 Mutations

TNNT2 gene encodes the Tm-binding subunit of the Tn complex in the 
heart, which acts as a regulator of striated muscle contraction in response to 
differential intracellular Ca2+ concentration [96]. It is well established 
that the association between pathogenic TNNT2 mutations and risk of 
cardiomyopathies [25].

The first case of RCM caused by a de novo mutation of TNNT2 
was reported in a 12-month-old girl [97]. This infantile case had experienced 
recurrent episodes of sinus bradycardia and tachycardia, malignant ventricular 
arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability. She received extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation therapy, followed by a biventricular assist device insertion and 
subsequently underwent heart transplantation [97]. Genetic testing revealed a 
novel deletion mutation c.285_287GGA in exon 9 of TNNT2, resulting in 
deletion of glutamine in 96 amino acid residual (p.96delE). The p.96delE mutation 
is located in the highly conserved domain. It induces the deficiency of a 
negative charge in the coiled-coil region, affecting the TnT-Tm-actin complex’s 
interactions [98]. Following experimental results demonstrated that p.96delE 
mutation significantly increased the Ca2+ sensitivity in fibres 
reconstituted with the adult and fetal TnT isoforms. However, the effect was 
enhanced in adult Tn protein [99]. Another heterozygous in-frame double deletion 
mutation (c.297-302AATGAG) in exon 9 of TNNT2 was reported in an RCM 
pediatric patient. That led to the deletion of asparagine and glutamic acid, two 
highly conserved amino acids, at positions 100 and 101, respectively 
(p.100-101delNE) [26]. This case’s clinical condition deteriorated rapidly with 
frequent chest pain and dyspnea, and the patient ultimately received a heart 
transplant 15 months after initial presentations. Histology indicated mild muscle 
hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and disarray of the myocytes. It must be 
mentioned that those observations revealed a certain overlap of restrictive and 
hypertrophic phenotypes that coexisted in this RCM case.

Some missense mutations proved to be associated with RCM. In a large family with 
autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, the c.236T>A missense mutation in exon 8 of 
TNNT2 led to the substitution of isoleucine (I) with asparagine (N) at 
amino acid position 79 (p.I79N) [13]. RCM caused by this mutation often 
complicated massive biatrial enlargement, markedly abnormal diastolic function, 
subsequent sinus bradycardia and progression to complete heart block, and even 
needed radiofrequency ablation and pacemaker/cardioverter-defibrillator 
implantation therapy in some patients. A transgenic mice model with targeted 
human cTnT (TNNT2 p.I79N) protein expression showed enhanced 
calcium-activated force generation and ATPase activity without muscle 
hypertrophy. The rate of Ca2+ dissociation from TnC during diastole 
decreases, and the baseline muscle tension increases, resulting in slower 
relaxation, the elevation of end-diastolic pressure and subsequent diastolic 
heart failure [100, 101]. Another index RCM case induced by a novel nucleotide 
substitution g.9718G>A in exon 10 of TNNT2 was associated with myocyte 
vacuolation according to the histology of proband’s explanted heart. This 
disorder is commonly observed in TnT-mutation related cardiomyopathy [23, 27]. 
The underlying pathogenicity of this new variant remains to be elucidated.

Therefore, the identified TNNT2 mutations, such as p.100-101delNE and 
p.I79N, associated with RCM often occur in a TnT binding fragment corresponding 
to residues 70–170 in the N-terminal domain. This finding suggests the existence 
of a mutational hotspot region in TNNT2 where mutations may result in 
impaired Tm-dependent functions of cTnT [102].

### 3.3 TNNC1 Mutations

Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) consists of two globular EF-hand (the most common 
calcium-binding motif) domains and a flexible linker. The calcium-sensing part of 
the Tn complex is troponin C encoded by TNNC1 in both cardiac muscle and 
slow skeletal muscle. There are two high-affinity calcium-binding sites in the 
C-domain of cTnC where are often occupied by Ca2+ in physiologic conditions 
[103].

Previously, mutations in TNNC1 have been associated with HCM or DCM. 
Nowadays, the evidence indicated that a compound heterozygous mutation p.A8V 
(c.C23T) and p.D145E (c.C435A) in TNNC1 inducing fatal RCM was described 
in a pediatric proband who inherited the mutation from her unaffected paternal 
grandmother and maternal grandfather, respectively [28]. The younger sister of 
this proband, who carried the same genetic background, initially showed 
congenital HCM, evolved to RCM, subsequently occurred with heart failure and 
death. This phenomenon suggests that RCM induced by the compound heterozygosity 
p.A8V and p.D145E is combined with a young-onset marked restrictive physiology, 
familial history of sudden cardiac death and gradually evolves into septal 
hypertrophy. The p.A8V mutation alone caused a more open cTnC N-domain 
conformation, presumably increasing interactions with the switch region of cTnI 
[104], while the p.D145E mutation altered Ca2+ bind by the C-domain of cTnC 
[105]. It appeared not compatible with the fact that the grandparents of the 
proband who carried single p.A8V or p.D145E allele were unaffected. The seemingly 
contrasting finding might be explained by the possibility that the single 
mutation was haploinsufficiency to cause a complete penetrance. However, the 
combination of compound heterozygotes p.A8V and p.D145E resulted in a more severe 
phenotype of RCM. Experimental results demonstrated that the major abnormality 
induced by p.A8V and p.D145E mutations at the same time was the decreased Ca2+ off-rate, altered muscle relaxation and impairing diastolic function [106, 107].

### 3.4 Myosin Associated Mutations

As described above, myosin is a hexameric contractile protein containing two 
heavy chains (MHC, encoded by MYH7 in the heart) associated with four 
light chains (MLC). The four MLCs are classified as two regulatory light chains 
(encoded by MYL2 in the heart) and two essential light chains (encoded 
by MYL3 in the heart). The C-terminal part of each MHC is α 
helical, whereas its N-terminal part folds into a globular head region called 
subfragment 1 (S1). The S1 contains a motor domain binding to actin. It 
hydrolyses ATP and a neck domain composed of a regulatory and essential light 
chain, respectively, functioning as a lever for filament sliding in contraction 
[108, 109].

A de novo heterozygous mutation p.P838L was firstly identified in 
MYH7 in an infantile RCM case. The clinical presentation of this proband 
was characterized by early-onset, mild hypertrophy of the left ventricle and a 
very short evolution to death [14]. The p.P838L mutation is located in an 
extremely conserved hinge segment between the rod region and the globular head 
region of myosin protein. The marked restrictive physiology might result from the 
myosin head region’s impaired flexion during the relaxation cycle. However, in a 
p.P838L myosin transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model, the heart morphology and 
cardiac function was normal, although the p.P838L mutant myosin increased basal 
ATPase, actin sliding velocity, rotational flexibility and the average angle of 
two heads in vitro  [110]. On the one hand, the seemingly different 
findings might result from the possibility that Drosophila myosin protein is less 
sensitive to the p.P838L perturbation than humans. On the other hand, the 
identification of the human pathogenic mutations involved sequencing of select 
candidate genes. Hence, it is possible that a mutation in another genetic locus, 
alone or in conjunction with P838L myosin, is responsible for the severe 
phenotype observed in the human patients [110]. Another missense mutation, p.G768R 
in exon 21 of MYH7, also was found in a pediatric RCM case [29]. The 
p.G768R locates in a highly conserved region across species and has previously 
been reported as a disease-causing mutation associated in adults with HCM [111]. 
It suggests that the phenotypic manifestations of MYH7 mutations in 
children, especially young ones, are different from adult ones. Further 
investigations are needed to determine whether other untested genetic mutations 
or sensitive indicators functioned as potential contributors to the severity and 
age of onset. A novel MYH7 p.R721K mutation was found in an RCM proband, 
who died at 47-year old due to progressive congestive heart failure, and her 
young son both showed biatrial enlargement, normal wall thickness and restrictive 
features. Yet, her other non-carrier son did not have these features [30]. The 
p.R721K mutation located in the converter domain of MYH7 affects 
myosin’s ATPase activity. RCM induced by MYH7 mutation in this domain is 
associated with severe diastolic heart failure, high rates of atrial 
fibrillation, stroke, poor prognosis and even sudden cardiac death [30]. Another 
p.Y386C mutation was reported in exon 13 of MYH7, which was previously 
seen in an infant with de novo HCM by the laboratory. The index case 
died at the age of 18 months, and the autopsy findings presented RCM, not HCM 
[31]. Interestingly, this is the first observation in a patient with RCM 
overlapped myocardial bridging under an MYH7 mutant background.

RCM caused by MLC-related mutation was firstly reported in an El-Salvadoran 
22-year-old female. The patient underwent recurrent syncope and severe heart 
failure [32]. There were homozygous mutations of MYL3 p.E143K 
(c.427G>A), combined with a novel heterozygous mutation of MYL2 p.G57E 
(c.170G>A). Her mother, who carried a double heterozygous MYL3 p.E143K 
and MYL2 p.G57E, showed a normal echocardiogram and electrocardiogram 
examinations. According to this phenomenon, the homozygous MYL3 p.E143K 
was highly considered to contribute to RCM in the proband [32].

### 3.5 TPM1 Mutations

The α-tropomyosin is encoded by TPM1 and plays a crucial role 
in actin regulation and stability, participating in fundamental functions in 
heart development. Mutations in TPM1 cause dominantly inherited 
cardiomyopathies [112]. Almost all recently reported TPM1 variants are 
missense mutations that resulted in a single amino acid substitution.

A novel homozygous missense mutation TPM1 p.N279H (c.835A>C) was 
found in an Italian RCM case. The endomyocardial biopsy showed mild myocyte 
hypertrophy and no evidence of amyloid or iron deposition [32]. This proband’s 
father carried heterozygous p.N279H mutation and was diagnosed with HCM in the 
absence of restrictive physiology. In 2021, the compound heterozygous 
TPM1 variants p.E62Q (c.184G>C) and p.M281T (c.842T>C) were 
identified in a child with RCM for the first time [33]. This proband was 
diagnosed with RCM at the age of 6, received orthotopic heart transplantation at 
12-year old, and reached adult age without cardiovascular events. In addition, 
the family members of the proband carrying one of these two mutations presented 
HCM phenotypes. Following tests suggested that TPM1 mutations resulted 
in time-dependent and progressive deterioration of cardiomyocyte CaT amplitudes. 
Yet, the reduced CaT amplitudes and the deficient sarcomeric structures are 
independent of the TPM1 mutations and the clinical phenotypes of 
cardiomyopathies [33].

### 3.6 ACTC1 and MYBPC3 Mutations

Actin is a highly conserved protein and encoded by ACTC1. 
Mutations in this gene have been phenotypically associated with various cardiac 
abnormalities. A novel p.D313H mutation (g.4642G>C) in exon 5 of ACTC1 
was observed in an individual with RCM [23]. Interestingly, the proband’s father 
died from DCM after heart transplantation and the older sister was diagnosed with 
overlapping phenotypes of RCM and DCM. The p.D313H was located in the immobilized 
region of the actin filament, acting as an important tropomyosin-binding site 
[113]. The specific mechanism by how the p.D313H mutation induced various clinical 
phenotypes of cardiomyopathy remains unclear.

The MYBPC3 gene encodes the cardiac isoform of myosin-binding protein C 
(MyBPC), a myosin-associated and large multi-domain protein. The role of MyBPC in 
the sarcomere regulation is not yet fully understood. Previously, MYBPC3 
mutations were demonstrated highly related to familial HCM [114]. However, a 
nonsense mutation MYBPC3 p.Q463X (c.1387C>T) was identified in a 
multigenerational family with three adult RCM patients. Moreover, another 
missense mutation MYBPC3 p.E334K (c.1000G>A) was observed in an 
unrelated patient [34]. A zebrafish model with genetic knockdown of 
MYBPC3 showed ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic heart failure 
manifestations, including decreased diastolic relaxation velocity, pericardial 
effusion and dilatation of the atrium [115]. It is noted that primary RCM caused 
by MYBPC3 mutation is associated with severe diastolic dysfunction, yet 
the long-term prognosis is still obscure [34].

### 4. Nonsarcomeric Gene Mutations

While nonsarcomeric mutations-associated RCM subtypes are less common, several 
mutations have recently been identified in index cases.

Desmin is encoded by DES and functions as the chief intermediate 
filament of the skeletal and cardiac tissue connecting the Z-bands to the 
subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. Cardiomyopathies caused by DES mutations 
often present severe restrictive physiology, syncope, sudden cardiac death due to 
conduction defect and overlap with a heterogeneous group of skeletal myopathies 
[116].

In four unrelated probands with RCM complicated with the atrioventricular block 
(AVB), there were three novel mutations p. R16C, p.T453I, a 10-bp deletion at the 
exon-intron boundary of exon 3 and one known heterozygous mutation p.R406W 
identified in DES  [35]. The novel p.R16C mutation was associated with a 
recessive phenotype due to the absence of RCM in three heterozygous carriers. The 
novel p.T453I mutation is located in the highly conserved 9-amino acid motif 
among type III intermediate filaments acting as desmin interaction with other 
cytoskeletal proteins [117]. The new 10-bp deletion at the exon-intron boundary 
of exon 3 damaged the exon 3 donor splice site, predicting the loss of 32 amino 
acids and the accumulation of desmin-positive material [118]. The known p.R406W 
mutation was located in the C-terminal of the desmin core domain and associated 
with early-onset severe cardiac and skeletal myopathy [119]. Although the 
probands carry different mutations affecting different domains, all shared the 
identical cardiac phenotypes of RCM in combination with AVB [35]. Another novel 
homozygous missense mutation DES p.Y122H (c.364T>C) was also reported 
in the index patient with RCM plus AVB [36]. Following experimental results 
in vitro revealed a severe filament assembly defect of mutant DES 
protein. The novel DES p.E413K mutation was identified in a family with 
pure RCM, including three affected and five at-risk members. The pathogenicity of 
p.E413K mutation at a highly conserved end of the alpha-helical rod domain might 
induce potential disruption of intramolecular interactions and inability of 
filamentous cellular network [37]. Recently, in an index patient with RCM in 
combination with atrial fibrillation, there was a heterozygous mutation 
c.735G>C in DES. This mutation affected the last base pair of exon 3 
and caused a splice site defect. RCM caused by this mutation showed right heart 
failure, massive dilation of the right atrium and recurrent atrial fibrillation 
[38].

The MYPN gene encodes myopalladin protein connecting structural 
regulatory molecules by translocation from the Z-lines and I-bands to the 
cardiomyocyte nucleus [120]. Mutations in MYPN associated with DCM, HCM 
and RCM have been reported. MYPN p.Q529X mutation was identified in 
siblings with RCM, yet their carriers’ mother was not affected. Different 
phenotypes were observed in family members carrying the same mutation [19]. The 
phenomenon of reduced penetrance of p.Q529X mutation might be explained by the 
possibility that the patients with RCM had other disease-associated mutations 
inherited from their father and absent from their mother. The knock-in 
heterozygote MYPN p.Q526X mutant mice revealed the diastolic dysfunction 
and restrictive physiology. There was preserved systolic function without overt 
hypertrophic remodeling. The phenotype of mutant mice resembles RCM induced by 
p.Q529X in humans [121].

TTN (also called titin) gene encodes the largest human protein 
consisting of 364 exons and approximately 38,000 amino acid residues with a 
molecular weight of 4200 kDa. The TTN protein provides architectural support and 
sarcomeric organization during muscle contraction [122]. Mutations in 
TTN refer to the different phenotypes of cardiomyopathies and missense 
variants are very common and frequently benign in DCM [123]. A linkage analysis 
study identified a missense mutation TTN p.Y7621C (c.22862A>G) in a 
family with RCM involving six affected individuals aged 12–35 years [11]. The 
p.Y7621C mutation is located in titin’s most highly conserved A/I junction 
region, connecting the compliant I-band and the rigid thick filament bound 
A-band. The clinical presentations of RCM induced by TTN mutation showed 
severe diastolic dysfunction overlapped with atrial fibrillation and 
thromboembolic phenomena.

Filamin C is an actin-cross-linking protein encoded by FLNC in heart 
muscle. Pathogenic mutations in FLNC have been reported to cause 
dominant isolated cardiomyopathy phenotype. The prevalence of patients carrying a 
unique FLNC pathogenic mutation in a cohort was evaluated 8% in RCM 
[124]. It has been identified that two novel missense mutations, FLNC 
p.S1624L and p.I2160F, were associated with familial RCM. It was suspected that 
FLNC and DES mutations shared similar pathological mechanisms 
due to identical behaviour of cytoplasmic aggregation [39].

Mutation in BAG3 is a rare cause of RCM. Recently, a heterozygous 
mutation p.P209L (c.626C>T) in exon 3 of BAG3 was found in a 
15-year-old girl. The proband showed severe myopathy, neuropathy, asymptomatic 
long QT syndrome and late-onset RCM [40]. The BAG3 p.P209L mutation was 
also present in another index patient who suffered from severe myofibrillar 
myopathy and RCM [41].

### 4.1 DES Mutations

Desmin is encoded by DES and functions as the chief intermediate 
filament of the skeletal and cardiac tissue connecting the Z-bands to the 
subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. Cardiomyopathies caused by DES mutations 
often present severe restrictive physiology, syncope, sudden cardiac death due to 
conduction defect and overlap with a heterogeneous group of skeletal myopathies 
[116].

In four unrelated probands with RCM complicated with the atrioventricular block 
(AVB), there were three novel mutations p. R16C, p.T453I, a 10-bp deletion at the 
exon-intron boundary of exon 3 and one known heterozygous mutation p.R406W 
identified in DES  [35]. The novel p.R16C mutation was associated with a 
recessive phenotype due to the absence of RCM in three heterozygous carriers. The 
novel p.T453I mutation is located in the highly conserved 9-amino acid motif 
among type III intermediate filaments acting as desmin interaction with other 
cytoskeletal proteins [117]. The new 10-bp deletion at the exon-intron boundary 
of exon 3 damaged the exon 3 donor splice site, predicting the loss of 32 amino 
acids and the accumulation of desmin-positive material [118]. The known p.R406W 
mutation was located in the C-terminal of the desmin core domain and associated 
with early-onset severe cardiac and skeletal myopathy [119]. Although the 
probands carry different mutations affecting different domains, all shared the 
identical cardiac phenotypes of RCM in combination with AVB [35]. Another novel 
homozygous missense mutation DES p.Y122H (c.364T>C) was also reported 
in the index patient with RCM plus AVB [36]. Following experimental results 
in vitro revealed a severe filament assembly defect of mutant DES 
protein. The novel DES p.E413K mutation was identified in a family with 
pure RCM, including three affected and five at-risk members. The pathogenicity of 
p.E413K mutation at a highly conserved end of the alpha-helical rod domain might 
induce potential disruption of intramolecular interactions and inability of 
filamentous cellular network [37]. Recently, in an index patient with RCM in 
combination with atrial fibrillation, there was a heterozygous mutation 
c.735G>C in DES. This mutation affected the last base pair of exon 3 
and caused a splice site defect. RCM caused by this mutation showed right heart 
failure, massive dilation of the right atrium and recurrent atrial fibrillation 
[38].

### 4.2 MYPN Mutations

The MYPN gene encodes myopalladin protein connecting structural 
regulatory molecules by translocation from the Z-lines and I-bands to the 
cardiomyocyte nucleus [120]. Mutations in MYPN associated with DCM, HCM 
and RCM have been reported. MYPN p.Q529X mutation was identified in 
siblings with RCM, yet their carriers’ mother was not affected. Different 
phenotypes were observed in family members carrying the same mutation [19]. The 
phenomenon of reduced penetrance of p.Q529X mutation might be explained by the 
possibility that the patients with RCM had other disease-associated mutations 
inherited from their father and absent from their mother. The knock-in 
heterozygote MYPN p.Q526X mutant mice revealed the diastolic dysfunction 
and restrictive physiology. There was preserved systolic function without overt 
hypertrophic remodeling. The phenotype of mutant mice resembles RCM induced by 
p.Q529X in humans [121].

### 4.3 TTN Mutations

TTN (also called titin) gene encodes the largest human protein 
consisting of 364 exons and approximately 38,000 amino acid residues with a 
molecular weight of 4200 kDa. The TTN protein provides architectural support and 
sarcomeric organization during muscle contraction [122]. Mutations in 
TTN refer to the different phenotypes of cardiomyopathies and missense 
variants are very common and frequently benign in DCM [123]. A linkage analysis 
study identified a missense mutation TTN p.Y7621C (c.22862A>G) in a 
family with RCM involving six affected individuals aged 12–35 years [11]. The 
p.Y7621C mutation is located in titin’s most highly conserved A/I junction 
region, connecting the compliant I-band and the rigid thick filament bound 
A-band. The clinical presentations of RCM induced by TTN mutation showed 
severe diastolic dysfunction overlapped with atrial fibrillation and 
thromboembolic phenomena.

### 4.4 FLNC and BAG3 Mutations

Filamin C is an actin-cross-linking protein encoded by FLNC in heart 
muscle. Pathogenic mutations in FLNC have been reported to cause 
dominant isolated cardiomyopathy phenotype. The prevalence of patients carrying a 
unique FLNC pathogenic mutation in a cohort was evaluated 8% in RCM 
[124]. It has been identified that two novel missense mutations, FLNC 
p.S1624L and p.I2160F, were associated with familial RCM. It was suspected that 
FLNC and DES mutations shared similar pathological mechanisms 
due to identical behaviour of cytoplasmic aggregation [39].

Mutation in BAG3 is a rare cause of RCM. Recently, a heterozygous 
mutation p.P209L (c.626C>T) in exon 3 of BAG3 was found in a 
15-year-old girl. The proband showed severe myopathy, neuropathy, asymptomatic 
long QT syndrome and late-onset RCM [40]. The BAG3 p.P209L mutation was 
also present in another index patient who suffered from severe myofibrillar 
myopathy and RCM [41].

### 5. Infiltrative RCM-Associated Mutations

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is considered as the prototype of the infiltrative form 
of RCM. Although CA can be acquired, there are several mutations in genes 
involving transthyretin (TTR). TTR primarily serves as a transporter for thyroxin 
and for retinol-binding protein. This protein is a tetramer, but has an innate 
ability to dissociate into monomers which tend to be amyloidogenic properties. 
There are three main types of CA: immunoglobulin light chain cardiac amyloidosis 
(AL-CA), wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt-CA) and mutant 
transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRm-CA) [3].

ATTRm-CA is an autosomal-dominant disease in which gene mutations lead to 
changes in the protein TTR. The clinical symptoms vary extensively depending on 
many factors including specific TTR mutation site and geographical 
distribution. The TTR p.V30M mutation was the most common worldwide 
which induces progressive peripheral sensory-motor polyneuropathy with later 
cardiac manifestations. However, other mutations p.V122I, p.I68L, p.L111M and 
p.T60A cause exclusively infiltrative cardiomyopathy [125]. The p.V122I mutation 
is prevalent in 3.4% of African Americans, and the clinical phenotype often 
refers to late-onset RCM, despite a low clinical penetrance of the disease [42]. 
Another prospective observational Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study 
reported that the p.V122I carriers had an increased risk of heart failure during 
the later years compared with non-carriers, indicating that p.V122I carriers are 
predominantly at increased risk of heart failure with an age-dependent penetrance 
[126, 127]. The p.I68L mutation is endemic in central-northern Italy and presents 
as HCM or RCM. Male preponderance is present in affected patients but not in 
unaffected mutation carriers [43]. The cardiac mutation p.L111M has been traced 
to three unrelated Danish families [44]. The patients showed developing or 
manifest RCM with a diastolic dysfunction as the first sign of disease. Ischemic 
symptoms were often present in the form of angina pectoris because of amyloid 
deposits in the coronary arteries [44]. Significantly, these patients with the 
p.L111M were younger and less likely to be male [128]. Familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy (FAP) resulting from the TTR p.T60A mutation was firstly 
described in 1986 in an Irish family [45]. Moreover, cardiac amyloidosis is 
always present at diagnosis in FAP p.T60A mutation, and is a major determinant of 
its poor prognosis. Other sporadic cases of RCM associated with TTR 
mutations such as p.A65G, p.H88R and p.S23N have recently been reported 
[46, 47, 48].

### 6. Conclusions and Perspectives

Previously, the invasive endomyocardial biopsy was needed to diagnose the 
primary cardiomyopathy, and genetic testing was probably underestimated. 
Nowadays, identifying disease-causing mutations in cardiomyopathy has shed new 
light on molecular mechanisms. Given the ever-broadening link between specific 
phenotype of RCM and pathogenic mutations, genetic testing would be advantageous 
to patients with severe diastolic dysfunction. Location of the mutation in gene 
influences the development of clinical phenotype of RCM. Therefore, recognizing 
the effects of shared genetic mutations and establishing a close association with 
clinical phenotypes is a major aim of future studies.
