## Minimal invasive biopsies are highly sensitive for amyloid detection in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy

### Abstract

AbstractObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of labial minor salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) alone or in combination with punch skin biopsy (SB) for the detection of amyloid deposits in hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv‐PN).MethodsIn this single‐center retrospective study, Congo red staining of minimal invasive LSGB (4 mm) and SB (3 mm) was assessed in ATTRv‐PN patients consecutively evaluated between 2012 and 2023.ResultsHistopathological data of 171 ATTRv‐PN, including 49 early‐onset p.Val50Met, 58 late‐onset p.Val50Met, and 64 non‐p.Val50Met, were reviewed. LSGB and SB identified amyloid deposits in 123/171 (72%) and 131/171 (77%) patients respectively (p = 0.2). Combining LSGB and SB increased the amyloid detection rate to 150/171 (88%), especially in late‐onset p.Val50Met (48/58 [83%]) and non‐p.Val50Met patients (55/64 [86%]). LSGB and SB have a similar rate of detection of amyloid depositions in early onset p.Val50Met patients (94%). Also, the LSGB/SB combination identified amyloidosis in 89% (55/62) of early‐stage ATTRv‐PN patients.ConclusionsIn our study, combining LSGB and SB allowed the detection of amyloid deposits in 88% of ATTRv‐PN patients. LSGB/SB analysis may be of major interest to confirm entry in the disease at very early‐stage ATTRv‐PN, with implications in disease‐modifying treatment initiation.

### INTRODUCTION

Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv‐PN) is a multi‐systemic disease with predominant peripheral nervous system involvement caused by mutation of the TTR gene.
1
, 
2
 Transthyretin amyloid deposition in peripheral nerves causes progressive peripheral nervous system degeneration, which, if left untreated, leads to progressive disability and death.
3
 Demonstrating amyloid deposition in tissues has been suggested by expert committees as crucial for the diagnosis of ATTRv amyloidosis,
4
 especially at the earliest stages of the disease, when disease‐modifying therapies may be effective in preventing disability progression.
2
, 
5
 To this aim, labial minor salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) is commonly performed, especially in early‐onset (EO) p.Val50Met populations, with various degrees of sensitivity in Portugal, Brazil, and France.

8
 Recently, we proposed skin as an alternative target tissue for biopsy, with its unique capacity to disclose both amyloid deposition and small nerve pathology in ATTRv‐PN
9
 even in patients with normal nerve conduction study.
10
 Herein, we analyze the effectiveness of LSGB, alone or in combination with punch skin biopsy (SB), in amyloid detection in a large heterogeneous ATTRv‐PN population.

### METHODS

We reviewed histopathological data from genetically confirmed ATTRv‐PN patients who performed both LSGB and SB in the same year, consecutively evaluated between January 2012 and December 2023 in our institution. Exclusion criteria (alternative causes of polyneuropathy), the definition of “symptomatic” subject, and disease severity stratification were the same as otherwise reported.
9
 In detail, patients who reported at least two symptoms from the Lauria questionnaire (Lauria score)
11
 and a Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS)
12
 ≥2 were considered symptomatic. Symptomatic patients were classified according to TTR mutation type and, in the case of p.Val50Met patients, as EO or LO with the cut‐off age of 50 years. Symptomatic patients were further stratified modifying the polyneuropathy disability (mPND) scoring system
15
 to identify those with a pure small‐fiber neuropathy phenotype. mPND‐1a, symptomatic small‐fiber neuropathy defined as a subject with at least two symptoms of the Lauria score,
11
 a NIS
12
 ≥2, and a normal NCS. NCS was defined as normal/impaired according to the age‐adjusted norms of sural and radial nerve amplitudes measured in our center. mPND1a stage patients, that is, subjects with symptomatic small‐fiber neuropathy and normal nerve conduction study,
9
 were analyzed separately.

Skin samples were obtained by 3 mm punch biopsy at the ankle, thigh, and wrist, then fixed and stained to determine intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) through immunofluorescence microscopy and to disclose Congo red birefringent deposition through direct/polarized light microscopy accordingly with previously published protocol.
9
 Briefly, skin samples were obtained using a 3‐mm disposable punch, from the following standard locations: 10 cm above the lateral malleolus (ankle) and 20 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine (thigh). Moreover, the vast part of our ATTRv cohort underwent an extra skin sampling 10 cm above the wrist, on the dorsal aspect of the forearm, to increase the likelihood of amyloid detection.

Immunofluorescence staining protocol for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and collagen type IV, as well as IENFD determination, was performed according to international standards.
13
 Seven micrometer sections were stained using the standard alkaline (pH 11) Congo red protocol to demonstrate the presence of amyloid deposits. A Congo red section was considered positive for amyloid when deposits were both visible under bright light and exhibited the characteristic apple‐green birefringence under polarized light.

LSGBs (4 mm) were performed with a suture‐less procedure as otherwise described.
14
 Twelve 7‐μm sections were stained using the standard alkaline (pH 11) Congo red protocol. Anti‐TTR immunohistochemistry was systematically performed on LSGB (Dako A0002, 1:2500) to confirm the nature of the amyloid depositions. A validated anti‐TTR immunohistochemistry protocol has been introduced recently for SB at our institution, so we do not have enough data for the current analysis. A Congo red section was considered positive when deposits were both visible under bright light and exhibited the characteristic apple‐green birefringence under polarized light. The evaluating pathologist (CA) was blinded to diagnosis. In Figure 1, we provide some examples of SB and LSGB staining and procedures.

Analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8.2.1 software.

Since SB and LGSB are routinely performed in our Center as a part of the diagnostic workup of ATTRv‐PN, our institutional ethical committee (Bicêtre University Hospital, AP‐HP) stated that our standardly administered written informed consent, which includes a statement on sample preservation for research, obtained from all participants before biopsies, was sufficient to perform our research.

### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents

Since SB and LGSB are routinely performed in our Center as a part of the diagnostic workup of ATTRv‐PN, our institutional ethical committee (Bicêtre University Hospital, AP‐HP) stated that our standardly administered written informed consent, which includes a statement on sample preservation for research, obtained from all participants before biopsies, was sufficient to perform our research.

### RESULTS

The main demographical features are specified in Table 1. Histopathological data of 171 ATTRv‐PN (49 early‐onset p.Val50Met (29%), 58 late‐onset p.Val50Met (34%), 64 non‐p.Val50Met) (37%) were reviewed. Sixty‐two ATTRv‐PN patients were classified as mPND1a (30 early‐onset p.Val50Met). The age of onset of early‐onset p.Val50Met patients was significantly lower than late‐onset p.Val50Met and non‐p.Val50Met patients (33 years [IQR 29–40] vs. 67 [IQR 59.25–73.75] and 64 years [IQR 65–70], respectively, p < 0.0001).

LSGB versus SB comparison was not significant in all categories (p < 0.05).

Combined versus single biopsy p‐value.

LSGB detected amyloid deposits in a variable range between 59% (non‐p.Val50Met) and 94% (early‐onset p.Val50Met). SB detected amyloid deposits in a variable range between 64% in late‐onset p.Val50Met and 94% in early‐onset p.Val50Met. LSGB and SB showed comparable performances in the general ATTRv‐PN population (123/171 [72%] vs. 131/171 [77%] respectively, p = 0.38), as well as in various subgroups, except in non‐p.Val50Met, where SB was positive in 75% versus 59% of LSGB (not statistically significant) (Table 1). Combining LSGB and SB increased the amyloid detection rate in the general ATTRv‐PN population (150/171 [88%]), with the best improvements observed in late‐onset p.Val50Met, non‐ p.Val50Met, especially if mPND1a (Table 2). The amyloid detection rate of combined LSGB/SB vs. single biopsies reached statistical significance in the general ATTRv population, late‐onset p.Val50Met (considering SB), and non‐p.Val50Met (considering LSGB) (Table 2). The lack of significance in mPND1a sub‐populations is probably due to the small sample size. One hundred forty‐nine (149) subjects (88%) performed the complete three‐site SB, with the wrist added to classical combined ankle‐thigh biopsy: wrist did not add a significant contribution in amyloid detection over ankle‐thigh alone (Table 3).

Severe skin denervation was evident at the ankle, thigh, and wrist in the general study population and subgroups. IENFD reduction follows a length‐dependent modality in early and late‐onset sub‐populations, with wrist IEFND maintaining intermediate values. This tendency was less obvious in non‐p.Val50Met patients (Table 4).

SB and LSGB procedures have been well tolerated with no significant complications reported. The safety of LSGB is good but cannot be repeated over time since there is a risk of small nerve mesh lesions; in our experience (unpublished data) 196 patients had repeated punch skin biopsy versus 10 with repeated LSGB in the period 2012–2023.

### DISCUSSION

Recently, we proposed punch skin biopsy as a useful tool in ATTRv‐PN evaluation because of its peculiar ability to disclose both amyloid depositions and small unmyelinated nerve fiber loss.
9
 We selected 171 ATTRv‐PN patients from the same cohort who also had LSGB. In our population, LSGB revealed amyloid depositions in 72% of ATTRv‐PN subjects with sensitivity ranging from 59% in non‐p.Val50Met to 94% in early‐onset p.Val50Met (Table 2).

When comparing both LSGB and SB, sensitivity for detecting amyloid deposits was similar in early‐onset and late‐onset p.Val50Met, mPND1a general, and mPND1a early‐onset p.Val50Met. Still, it was better in SB versus LSGB for non‐p.Val50Met. Combined LSGB and SB increased sensitivity for detecting amyloid deposition in 88% of ATTRv‐PN patients, with a peak of 96% in early‐onset p.Val50Met.

Minimally invasive LSGB/SB combination increased amyloid detection, especially in late‐onset p.Val50Met and non‐p.Val50Met patients (Table 2). These performances are comparable to or even better than those of nerve biopsy.
15
 The reported sensitivity of LSGB ranges from 50% to 91%,

,

8
 while that of abdominal subcutaneous fat pad biopsy by 8 mm skin punch
16
—widely used to detect amyloid—has been reported between 45% and 91%.
16
, 
17
 These differences in sensitivity are likely due to ethnic/phenotypical heterogeneity and the different sample sizes of the populations analyzed in previous studies. Given the large sample size and wide genetic and phenotypical spectrum of our study population, our results provide solid data on the effectiveness of LSGB in ATTRv‐PN.

Moreover, to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that combining minimal invasive LSGB and SB is highly effective in detecting amyloid deposits even at the earliest stage of symptomatic disease (89% in mPND1a). At this early stage, patients mainly experience subjective sensitive and autonomic symptoms related to small fiber nerve loss/dysfunction with normal classical electrodiagnostic (NCS) features, and objective and sensitive tools of disease entry markers are lacking. Combining LSGB and (ankle‐thigh) SB biopsies in ATTRv subjects with symptomatic small‐fiber neuropathy and normal nerve conduction study (mPND1a) allows early identification of amyloid deposits, thus demonstrating that the disease is active. In Figure 2, we propose an algorithm meant to support clinicians in biopsy site choice: in subjects with mild (mPND1a) disease belonging to an early onset p.Val50Met family, SB (ankle‐thigh) is sufficient to disclose amyloid depositions, while, in late‐onset p.Val50Met and non‐p.Val50Met genotypes we propose to perform SB first and then LSGB (if SB is negative). The LSGB/SB combination could also be useful to confirm amyloid deposition in late‐onset p.Val50Met and non‐p.Val50Met subjects with overt polyneuropathy (>mPND1a). SB is sufficient in early‐onset p.Val50Met subjects with clear polyneuropathy (Figure 2). We recommend using SB and/or LSGB biopsies especially if there are doubts about differential diagnosis (e.g.: coexistence with other causes of polyneuropathy such as diabetes).

Recommendations for minimally invasive biopsies for amyloid deposition detection in newly symptomatic mPND1A (A) and overt (B) ATTRv‐PN. EO, early onset; LO, late onset; LSGB, labial minor salivary gland biopsy; SB, skin biopsy.

These results are crucial for the early initiation of disease‐modifying treatments (DMTs) in one of the most disabling hereditary rare diseases, knowing that ATTRv‐PN belongs to the 5% of rare diseases that have validated DMTs.
18

Finally, SB and LSGB were safe and well‐tolerated, with SB often repeated over time with no safety concerns.

Our study has some limitations: First, it was conducted retrospectively, so the sampling protocol (three‐site vs. thigh‐ankle SB protocol) was not completely homogeneous. Moreover, histopathological data came from a single institution. However, our ATTRv‐PN population was extensive regarding TTR gene variants, providing robust data on the effectiveness of combined LSGB/SB, even at the earliest stage of symptomatic disease. Finally, our study does not provide data about the amyloid quantification in tissues as performed in previous pivotal studies (e.g., “amyloid load”),
19
, 
20
, 
21
 which have been proposed as a biomarker of disease progression and severity in ATTRv. Our study is based on data about diagnostic biopsies used in daily clinical practice in which advanced quantitative analyses are not routinely performed. A quantification of tissue amyloid in a subset of our population could be the object of further studies.
