## From molecular variant to disease: initial steps in evaluating the association of transthyretin M119 with disease.

### Abstract

Traditionally, clinical research has sought to determine the molecular basis of clinical signs and symptoms. Increasingly, the traditional process will be reversed, as many structural protein variants are elucidated as a result of powerful PCR-based methods. Herein we describe a variant of transthyretin (TTR) found by direct genomic sequencing and illustrate the utility of PASA (PCR amplification of specific alleles) in the initial characterization of such variants. TTR is an intriguing protein of unknown function, but deposition of mutant TTR produces familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). We identify a carrier of a variant TTR in which threonine119 is changed to methionine (T119----M). T119 is invariant in five mammalian species, suggesting that this residue is important for normal protein function. To determine the frequency of the M119 variant, individuals of northern- and western-European descent were rapidly screened by generating a PASA assay for the sequence change. Four additional individuals were found to be heterozygous for the mutation, for a total of five M119 alleles in 1,666 genes (1/333). Clinical records, initial clinical interviews, and family history of these patients hint at a high frequency of early-onset venous insufficiency and perhaps mild renal dysfunction. Haplotype analysis on the heterozygotes could be performed, despite the absence of samples from relatives, by performing "double PASA." The haplotype data suggest that the M119 variant derives from a common ancestor. The putative functional deficiency caused by TTR M119 should be most marked in the homozygotes, who can be calculated to occur in 1/100,000 conceptions. If viable, these individuals may provide important clues about the physiological role of TTR. Although the nature (if any) of disease caused by TTR M119 remains to be defined, the genetic and clinical data indicate that this mutation does not cause FAP. Future family studies can determine whether the heterozygous state for TTR M119 cosegregates with a disease or trait.ImagesFigure 3Figure 4Figure 5
