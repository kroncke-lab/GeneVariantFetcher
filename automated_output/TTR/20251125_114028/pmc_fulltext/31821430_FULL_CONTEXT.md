### Abstract

Key PointsQuestionIs there an association between the V122I genetic variant of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with heart failure among individuals of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry?FindingsIn this observational study that included 9694 participants from 2 biobank registries, there was a significant association of the transthyretin V122I genetic variant with heart failure (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 in a cohort of African ancestry and 1.8 in a separate cohort of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry).MeaningAmong individuals of African or Hispanic/Latino ancestry, the transthyretin V122I genetic variant was significantly associated with heart failure.
