## Transthyretin Variant Amyloidosis with a TTR A97D (p.A117D) Mutation Manifesting Remarkable Asymmetric Neuropathy

### Abstract

We herein report a 68-year-old Japanese man with sporadic variant transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis harboring the novel variant A97D (p.A117D) in TTR. He had slow development of asymmetric neuropathy, unintentional weight loss, mild autonomic failure and mild cardiomyopathy. TTR amyloid deposition on the gastric duodenal mucosa was detected. In silico analyses predicted that TTR A97D (p.A117D) altered the structure and function of the TTR protein. ATTRv amyloidosis is often difficult to diagnose in non-endemic regions due to its diverse phenotypes, such as atypical peripheral nerve involvement and a rare family history.

### Introduction

Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis [also called transthyretin-type familial amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-FAP)] is an inherited, adult-onset, rare systemic disorder predominantly characterized by progressive peripheral neuropathy caused by a point mutation in the TTR gene (1-4). There are over 140 different TTR gene mutations identified worldwide, of which >40 mutations are linked with ATTRv amyloidosis in Japan (5,6).

V30M (p.V50M) is the most common type in Japan as well as in western countries. Clinical manifestations of patients in endemic regions are relatively uniform, characterized by an autosomal dominant trait with high penetration, an early age of onset, equal sex distribution and the presence of dissociated sensory loss, severe autonomic dysfunction and atrioventricular conduction block (1,2,4,7-9). However, these classic features are not seen for sporadic cases in non-endemic regions; instead, patients manifest diverse phenotypes, such as atypical peripheral nerve involvement, and a delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis are frequently reported (1,5,8-12).

Although ATTRv amyloidosis is an irreversible fatal disease, patients can benefit from some effective treatments if diagnosed in the early stage, and an early diagnosis is directly related to the extension of life expectancy. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be well aware of the diverse clinical phenotypes of this disease.

### Case Report

A 68-year-old Japanese man born in Hokkaido Prefecture developed numbness starting from the first toe of the right foot and slowly expanding to the bilateral lower legs and right hand over 2.5 years. He also noticed instability in walking a year ago. His medical history included Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosed 7 years ago and gallbladder cancer surgery conducted 2.5 years ago. He was taking levodopa/carbidopa hydrate 300 mg/day, levodopa/carbidopa hydrate/entacapone 200 mg/day, ropinirole hydrochloride 4 mg/day and amantadine hydrochloride 200 mg/day for PD as well as clonazepam 0.75 mg/day and mecobalamin 1,500 μg/day for numbness in the limbs. There was no family history of neurological disorders, except for an older brother with PD. His parents had maintained independent living until their later years.

The patient's height was 171 cm, and his weight was 54 kg, having lost 10 kg unintentionally over the past 2.5 years. The patient was afebrile and had blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a regular heart rate of 66 beats per minute. Heart murmur was not detected. An examination revealed livedo reticularis and Raynaud's phenomenon on his limbs, which were diagnosed by a dermatologist as physiological changes associated with the aging process. Ocular manifestations were not observed. Consciousness was clear and cognitive function was normal.

Neurological examinations revealed distal dominant weakness in the right upper limb and bilateral lower limbs (manual muscle testing grade 4) and decreased tendon reflexes in the right limb and bilateral Achilles tendons. Grip strength was 14 kg on the right and 28 kg on the left. He had moderate superficial and deep sensory disturbances in the right hand and bilateral lower legs, predominantly in distal portions. The Romberg test was positive. He also manifested left side dominant typical Parkinsonism, together with hyposmia, severe constipation and erectile dysfunction, but no diarrhea or orthostatic hypotension was noted. He was fully independent in activities of daily living.

A complete blood count was within normal ranges. Biochemical tests were normal except for mildly elevated serum creatine kinase (327 IU/L) and a high vitamin B12 level because of oral treatment. The C-reactive protein, free-T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, estimated glomerular filtration rate, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and troponin T values were normal. Antinuclear antibody, anti SS-A antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-centromere antibody, anti Scl-70 antibody, myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and proteinase3-ANCA were negative. Cryoglobulin was not detected. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mildly elevated proteins (68 mg/dL) but normal cell counts. Urinalysis findings were normal.

Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings were normal. Electrocardiography revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 66 beats per minute and slight ST segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, V5 and V6. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal cardiac function and structure without echo-bright appearance of the interventricular septum. On cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), late gadolinium enhancement was suspected in the lower posterior wall and subendocardium. Cardiac 99mtechnetium pyrophosphate scintigraphy did not suggest transthyretin amyloidosis. Cervical spine and brachial plexus MRI showed no abnormalities.

A nerve conduction study (NCS) revealed remarkable decline of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in the right median, right ulnar and bilateral tibial nerves. Sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes were significantly decreased in the right median, right ulnar and bilateral sural nerves (Table 1). However, NCS of the left upper limb was normal, except for a slightly decreased SNAP amplitude in the median nerve.

Unspecified vascular neuropathy was suspected based on the remarkable slowly progressive asymmetric axonal neuropathy with unintentional weight loss, livedo reticularis and Raynaud's phenomenon. A sural nerve biopsy revealed a remarkable decrease in the density of myelinated fibers and less reduction of unmyelinated fibers, without amyloid deposition (Fig. 1A-C). A fibularis brevis muscle biopsy revealed amyloid deposits on part of the blood vessel wall with remarkable grouped atrophy (Fig. 1D-G). In addition, TTR amyloid deposits on gastric duodenal mucosa were detected using anti-TTR (115-124) antibodies (13), and unspecified amyloid deposits on abdominal fat aspiration, myocardium and colonic mucosa were also detected (Fig. 1H, I, 2).

TTR staining was performed only on gastric duodenal biopsy specimens. An analysis of the TTR gene was conducted after obtaining the patient's informed consent. We identified a previously unreported heterozygous A97D (p.A117D) (c.350 C>A) mutation in TTR. The A97D (p.A117D) mutation has not been described in disease-causing variant databases, such as the NCBI dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), the Human Gene Mutation Database Professional (http://www.hgmd.org/) or ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), or in healthy individual databases, the 1,000 Genomes Project (http://www.internationalgenome.org) and gnomAD (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) (Table 2). Furthermore, the A117 amino acid is highly conserved across various species (Fig. 3). A variant with this mutation was predicted to be pathogenic when analyzed using bioinformatics tools, such as PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), SIFT (https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg), Mutation Tester (http://www.mutationtaster.org/), CADD (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) and M-CAP (http://bejerano.stanford.edu/mcap/) (Table 2). We therefore investigated the gastric and duodenal mucosal biopsy specimens using laser microdissection and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze the composition rate of variant TTR (D117) and wild-type TTR (A117) in the amyloid fibrils. The tryptic peptide mass peak ratio of variant TTR to wild-type TTR in the amyloid deposits was 83:17 (Fig. 4). This patient was ultimately diagnosed with sporadic ATTRv amyloidosis and started on patisiran sodium treatment.

### Discussion

We reported a case of sporadic ATTRv amyloidosis in a non-endemic region caused by a novel TTR A97D (p.A117D) mutation manifesting remarkable asymmetric neuropathy. ATTRv amyloidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by progressive peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in the TTR gene (1-4). Patients with TTR V30M (p.V50M), the most commonly observed mutation, are generally considered to be concentrated in geographically restricted regions of Japan, Sweden and Portugal (2,14,15). However, recent analyses have revealed a late-onset form of this mutation distributed outside the endemic regions (8,16). In addition, the clinical phenotypes of patients in non-endemic regions and those with mutations other than V30M (p.V50M) vary widely (Table 3) (1,3,6-8,17).

Comparison of Clinical Manifestations between V50M in Endemic Regions, V50M in Non-endemic Regions, and Non-V50M ATTRv Amyloidosis.

In Japan, the type of TTR variant, age of onset, penetrance and clinical symptoms of V30M (p.V50M) are more varied than in other countries (5). The TTR A97D (p.A117D) mutation harbored by the present patient had not been reported in any of the evaluated disease-causing variant databases or healthy individual databases (Table 2). Furthermore, the amino acid p.Ala117 was highly conserved among species (Fig. 3). Based on these findings as well as analyses using several bioinformatics tools, we determined TTR A97D (p.A117D) to be a disease-causing mutation.

Sporadic ATTRv amyloidosis further increases the diagnostic difficulty in non-endemic regions, and the mean interval from the onset to the diagnosis was reported to be 3-4 years (10,17). Only 26-38% of the cases were suspected of having amyloidosis at the first assessment (18,19), and up to 20% of them were misdiagnosed and treated for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy instead (10). Patients with typical ATTRv amyloidosis manifest length-dependent sensory-motor polyneuropathy, which is characterized by symptoms of neuropathic pain, numbness, and weakness in advanced cases. However, several atypical phenotypes have been described, including an upper limb onset (11), asymmetry (10) and electrophysiological findings of axonal demyelination (10,12). In France, a non-endemic region, 4 of 90 patients developed marked asymmetric limb paresthesia (10), and 32 of 182 patients developed upper limb paresthesia as the initial symptom 2-3 years preceding lower limb paresthesia (11); in the latter report, 75% of the patients had a misdiagnosis, and some cases showed asymmetric upper limb paresthesia, except for carpal tunnel syndrome (11).

Amyloid deposits within nerve lesions are unevenly distributed (20), with focal or multifocal neuropathy induction being particularly possible in the early stage of disease. Sekijima suggested that the coexistence of a family history, autonomic dysfunction, cardiac involvement, carpal tunnel syndrome, gastrointestinal disturbances, unexplained weight loss and resistance to immunotherapy was a red flag for potential ATTRv amyloidosis (5). Our patient also developed unintentional weight loss and dysautonomia, including severe constipation and erectile dysfunction, but these symptoms can also be interpreted as manifestations of PD. Although unintentional weight loss is a common non-motor symptom, and approximately half of patients with PD experience it during the course of the disease, we should have suspected the possibility of amyloidosis earlier (21). Consequently, it took approximately three years from the onset before our patient was diagnosed.

Although both our patient and his brother were affected by PD, they had not been examined for familial PD. The coexistence of ATTRv amyloidosis and PD has not been reported. We interpret this case as a coincidence of two neurodegenerative diseases. Coexistence of ATTRv amyloidosis with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (22) and ATTRv amyloidosis with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (23) have both been reported as incidental complications. Although the present patient's brother has not shown peripheral nerve changes or heart impairment as of yet, he may need careful follow-up.

The authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).
