## Identification of the Interfacial Regions in Misfolded Transthyretin Oligomers

### Abstract

Misfolding and aggregation of transthyretin (TTR) is associated with numerous ATTR amyloidosis. TTR aggregates extracted from ATTR patients consist of not only full-length TTR, but also N-terminally truncated TTR fragments that can be produced by proteolytic cleavage, suggesting the presence of multiple misfolding pathways. Here, we report mechanistic studies of an early stage of TTR aggregation to probe the oligomerization process for the full-length as well as N-terminally truncated TTR. Our kinetic analyses using size exclusion chromatography revealed that amyloidogenic monomers dissociated from wild-type (WT) as well as pathogenic variants (V30M and L55P) form misfolded dimers, which self-assemble into oligomers, precursors of fibril formation. Dimeric interfaces in the full-length misfolded oligomers were investigated by examining the effect of single-point mutations on the two β-strands (F and H). The single-point mutations on the two β-strands (E92P on strand F and T119W on strand H) inhibited the dimerization of misfolded monomers, while the TTR variants can still form native dimers through the same F and H strands. These results suggest that the two strands are involved in intermolecular associations for both native and misfolded dimers, but detailed intermolecular interactions are different in the two forms of dimers. In the presence of a proteolytic enzyme, TTR aggregation is greatly accelerated. The two mutations on the two β-strands, however, inhibited TTR aggregation even in the presence of a proteolytic enzyme, trypsin. These results suggest that the two β-strands (F and H) play a critical role in aggregation of the N-terminally truncated TTR as well.
