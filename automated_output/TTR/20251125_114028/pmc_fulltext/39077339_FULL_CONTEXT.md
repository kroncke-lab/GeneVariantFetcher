## Establishment of a Comprehensive Cardiac Amyloidosis Center in a Community Hospital Setting

### Abstract

Cardiac amyloidosis is a great masquerader that often results in misdiagnosis of 
this condition. Early clinical recognition is crucial for timely therapeutic 
interventions to improve survival in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. 
Currently, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications work best if 
started early in the disease. Thus, to increase identification, disease 
awareness, expertise in diagnostic techniques, and a multidisciplinary team 
approach is essential. The majority of the patients (~90%) in 
the United States are treated in community hospitals, thus, it would be helpful 
for these hospitals to have their own designated, comprehensive cardiac 
amyloidosis center to provide care to the patients who are widespread in the 
community. Most of these patients are elderly, and it is difficult for these 
patients to travel long distances to academic amyloid centers. Our manuscript 
aims to provide a path to the development of cardiac amyloid centers at community 
hospitals.

### 1. Overview of Cardiac Amyloidosis

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy that commonly causes 
heart failure and results from the extracellular deposition of misfolded 
proteins, which configures the insoluble beta-pleated sheet structures called 
amyloid fibrils. Over 30 amyloid precursor proteins are identified, nine of which 
frequently cause CA, of which over 95% result from the amyloid light chain (AL) 
and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) [1, 2, 3]. AL arises from misfolded monoclonal 
immunoglobulin light chains (produced from clonal plasma cells), and ATTR arises from misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein (produced 
predominantly in the liver), resulting in AL-CA and ATTR-CA respectively. ATTR 
can occur either through mutation in transthyretin (variant-ATTR/ATTRv) or 
age-related processes without mutation in transthyretin (wild-type ATTR/ATTRwt). 
Thus, AL-CA, ATTRwt-CA, or ATTRv-CA are the most common types of CA [4]. 
Valine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 122 (Val122Ile) is the most common 
mutation causing ATTRv-CA in the USA, seen in 3.5% of African Americans, 
especially of Western African origin [5]. AL-CA is rare, with an annual incidence 
estimated to be 1 in 75,000 to 100,000 as of 2015, with cardiac involvement 
present in about 75% of patients [4]. The true prevalence of ATTR-CA in the 
population is unknown. However, several autopsy studies have shown the prevalence 
of ATTRwt amyloid deposits up to 20–25% in octogenarians and 37% in people 
over age 95 [2]. ﻿Cardiac involvement determines the prognosis in patients with 
amyloidosis, with median survival rates ranging from 3.6 to 4.8 years for 
ATTRwt-CA, 2.6 years for ATTRv-CA due to Val122Ile, and 5.8 years for ATTRv-CA 
due to other mutations and less than six months for AL-CA, if left untreated 
[4, 6]. Therefore, early clinical recognition is crucial for timely therapeutic 
interventions to improve survival in patients with CA.

### 2. Need for Cardiac Amyloidosis Centers

CA is a great masquerader because of its marked heterogeneity 
in terms of cardiac phenotype or systemic involvement, often resulting in 
misdiagnosis for other more common diseases such as hypertensive heart disease, 
aortic stenosis, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [7, 8]. As a result, many patients 
experience significant delays in receiving a correct diagnosis, with 31.8% of 
patients reporting consulting more than five physicians before receiving a 
correct diagnosis of amyloidosis [9]. To overcome these challenges, a 
multidisciplinary team approach involving expertise such as cardiologists, 
hematologists, neurologists, nephrologists, nuclear imaging experts, 
pathologists, genetic counselors, nurses, and specialty pharmacists is necessary. 
This approach involves identifying diagnostic clues or red flags for CA, 
screening high-risk patients with appropriate diagnostic tools and their 
appropriate interpretation, offering genetic testing and counseling, and 
providing treatment, including advanced therapies such as cardiac 
transplantation, thus highlighting the need for CA centers to provide all the 
facilities in one integrated setting.

The present era of CA is advancing significantly, allowing patients to survive 
for over a decade with treatment [4, 10]. Thus, patients with CA will require 
ongoing care from specialists to manage their chronic condition. However, not all 
patients have access to multidisciplinary care because of the limited 
availability of CA centers. For instance, as per the American Hospital 
Association’s annual survey for 2021, there are 6129 hospitals in the United 
States, of which 5157 are community hospitals [11]. As of April 2023, only 47 
centers in the United States participated in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis 
Outcomes Survey (THAOS) registry, the largest global, multicenter, longitudinal 
observational survey [12]. This poses a challenge for patients who are spread out 
across this country to travel to these centers to seek medical care, as travel, 
in particular, is reported as the most significant challenge by nearly one-third 
of patients [13]. To make this care more accessible, more CA centers should be 
established in the community near where patients live. This will help reduce 
travel time, increase awareness among community physicians, prompt more 
referrals, and ultimately result in more CA screening and identification. To 
provide care to the growing patient population, there will also be a need for 
more specialists in CA, which CA centers can help provide by establishing 
fellowship programs allowing opportunities for physicians to train in CA. 
Moreover, as of 2022, only one FDA-approved disease-directed therapy, Tafamidis, 
is available for ATTR-CA; thus, more CA centers are needed to provide a platform 
for ongoing and future clinical trials in this field [4, 14].

Our objective is to provide a structured approach and steps to help establish a 
new comprehensive CA center in a community-based hospital setting.

### 3. Estimate Institutional Needs and Benefits

The first step in establishing a CA center is demonstrating its necessity and 
benefits to the hospital. One reliable way to do this is by estimating the number 
of undiagnosed CA among patients already registered within the hospital system. 
For instance, the Medicare population has an estimated 17% prevalence of heart 
failure, with approximately 50% of those cases being heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [15, 16]. Assuming there are 100,000 Medicare 
patients enrolled in the hospital system, an estimated 17,000 patients may have 
heart failure, with 8500 patients potentially having HFpEF. Epidemiological 
studies suggest a 12–13% prevalence of CA in HFpEF, which means around 1100 
patients may have undiagnosed CA [17, 18]. An estimate of undiagnosed cases of CA 
can then be made by checking how many of these patients are receiving treatment 
for amyloidosis. As CA worsens heart failure and a result of an observational 
study showed that in Medicare beneficiaries, the per-patient cost from single 
heart failure hospitalization averaged around $14,600 with a mean length of stay 
for heart failure-related hospitalization being 7.07 days, this estimate can help 
assess the economic burden to the hospital from potential undiagnosed CA [19]. 
Thus, screening for CA and treating the affected ultimately results in 
significant financial improvement for the hospital by preventing 
hospitalizations. This estimation is critical to garner attention and get 
continuous support from the hospital administration.

After estimating the potential patients with undiagnosed underlying CA who are 
already in the hospital system, creating variables in the electronic medical 
records will be an important and effective way to identify these patients.

### 4. Availability of Multidisciplinary Expertise

After identifying the institutional need, recruiting a dedicated group of 
professionals with specific expertise is essential. This team should include 
specialists such as cardiologists, hematologists, neurologists, nephrologists, 
nuclear imaging experts, pathologists, genetic counselors, nurses, and specialty 
pharmacists. A patient navigator is also crucial in assisting patients with 
navigating complex healthcare systems, overcoming access barriers, and 
effectively managing medical paperwork, ensuring timely initiation and continued 
treatment adherence. In addition to the expertise, it is also equally essential 
to establish the necessary infrastructure.

### 5. Improve Awareness

Improving awareness among healthcare professionals is crucial in the early 
detection and intervention of CA [20, 21, 22]. Primary care physicians and various 
specialists, including cardiologists, hematologists, neurologists, 
gastroenterologists, nephrologists, and orthopedics, are among those who should 
be made aware of CA. They should be educated about the diagnostic clues or red 
flags that help identify high-risk patients under their care. Physicians should 
also be aware of the appropriate assessments and diagnostic tools. The 
institutional marketing department should inform the community physicians about 
the CA center. By doing so, patients at high risk can be referred early to 
cardiac amyloid specialists for screening of CA and treatment when the disease is 
established.

To increase awareness among physicians, educational programs like grand rounds, 
morbidity and mortality conferences, and regional and national meetings can be 
utilized to educate them on CA and its diagnostic clues or red flags. It is also 
crucial to raise awareness among the general public, especially African Americans 
who have a higher risk of developing ATTR-CA. One effective way to do this is by 
spreading or circulating educational videos at community events or coverage 
through local media outlets. This approach will promote medical care-seeking 
behavioral change. It will also encourage the patients to participate in ongoing 
and future clinical trials while supporting patients and their families.

### 6. Implementation of Diagnostic Tools and Assessment

A high level of suspicion is fundamental in making the diagnosis of CA. Knowing 
typical patterns of disease presentation, diagnostic clues or red flags, and 
commonly affected demographics will help to order specific laboratory and imaging 
studies. For instance, if an older individual is hospitalized for heart failure 
and has elevated baseline troponin levels or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels that don’t match 
the clinical context, it could be a sign of ATTR-CA. Other indicators include 
hypertension that eventually goes away or needs down-titration of 
antihypertensives and an inability to tolerate beta-blockers or ACE 
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. Early clues or red flags to ATTR-CA may 
include bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, previous 
orthopedic procedures, and spontaneous biceps tendon rupture [23, 24].

Screening the right patient population is the bottom line for accurately 
identifying the disease. It is essential to consider the pretest probability of 
finding the disease before conducting the screening. For instance, non-invasive 
methods using cardiac scintigraphy can accurately diagnose ATTR-CA without 
needing a biopsy in specific clinical scenarios with about 100% specificity 
[25]. However, failing to consider the pretest probability and conducting the 
screening incorrectly can decrease the accuracy of diagnostic tests. 
Additionally, a lack of expertise in interpreting test results can lead to 
false-positive or negative outcomes, reducing the sensitivity and specificity of 
the test. Here, we propose a framework for physicians, including clinical, 
electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and imaging diagnostic clues or red 
flags recommended by the experts in the field that should be considered while 
screening for CA, elaborated in Fig. 1.

Multispecialty comprehensive approach and diagnostic red flags 
or clinical clues for cardiac amyloidosis.

The diagnostic testing process starts with a high index of clinical suspicion 
based on clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and imaging 
diagnostic clues or red flags to CA. The diagnostic algorithm should start with 
screening for monoclonal proteins to assess for any underlying plasma cell 
dyscrasias, as the presence or absence of monoclonal proteins determines the 
appropriate diagnostic pathway. While cardiac scintigraphy is a useful 
noninvasive tool in diagnosing ATTR-CA, it is essential to note that 10% of 
patients with AL-CA may also show consistent cardiac uptake in scintigraphy. 
Thus, the interpretation of cardiac scintigraphy without checking for monoclonal 
protein can often lead to misinterpretation and inaccurate diagnosis and is not 
reliable for distinguishing between ATTR-CA and AL-CA [4, 25].

The initial screening methods for monoclonal proteins include serum-free light 
chain (sFLC) assay and serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE and 
UIFE). It is crucial to perform serum and urine electrophoresis with 
immunofixation to detect low levels of circulating monoclonal proteins. If no 
monoclonal proteins are detected in SIFE or UIFE, and the sFLC ratio is within 
the normal range, in that case, AL-CA can be reliably ruled out with a 
~99% negative predictive value and the specificity of cardiac 
scintigraphy for diagnosis of ATTR-CA is about 100% [4, 6, 25]. However, when 
monoclonal proteins are detected or the sFLC ratio is abnormal, then in such 
circumstances, a hematologist consultation is needed for the correct 
interpretation of the results, and a biopsy of the affected organ becomes 
absolute. AL-CA can be diagnosed only by demonstrating the deposits of AL amyloid 
fibrils in the affected organs.

Imaging is the next crucial step in the algorithm after obtaining laboratory 
results. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI can provide helpful information, but 
neither can diagnose CA or distinguish between AL-CA and ATTR-CA. Cardiac 
scintigraphy with technetium (Tc)-labeled bisphosphonates is the most useful 
option to confirm the presence of ATTR cardiac amyloid deposits after ruling out 
AL amyloidosis. Among the available radiotracer options for scintigraphy 
including 99mTc-labeled hydroxy methylene diphosphonate (HMDP), 99mTc-labeled 
diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD), and 99mTc-labeled pyrophosphate 
(PYP), Tc-PYP is the most commonly used radiotracer in the United States. The 
Tc-PYP scan is taken with both planer images, followed by a single-photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) study, which confirms the myocardial uptake 
of radiotracers [26]. An endomyocardial biopsy is required in scenarios where a 
monoclonal protein is detected, cardiac imaging is unavailable, or there is 
strong suspicion for CA despite negative or unclear results of cardiac 
scintigraphy [4, 6].

When diagnosis of ATTR-CA is confirmed with Tc-PYP cardiac scintigraphy, the 
next crucial step is to offer genetic counseling to patients and arrange for TTR 
genetic testing or sequencing [2]. This is crucial in distinguishing between 
ATTRwt-CA and ATTRv-CA, as clinical profiles are insufficient for 
differentiation. If the variant identified in the TTR gene sequencing is 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic, a three-generation (or more) family history 
should be obtained, and the at-risk first-degree healthy relatives should undergo 
cascade testing [4]. These healthy relatives should be offered pre- and 
post-genetic counseling sessions, including the implications of genetic testing 
on insurance and employment and therapeutic options based on testing results.

Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential for providing an opportunity for 
all specialists to collaborate and coordinate in providing expert-level 
comprehensive care to patients with CA in a single integrated setting. 
Cardiologists are the primary care providers for patients with ATTR-CA. At the 
same time, hematologists are often the primary care providers for patients with 
AL-amyloidosis in collaboration with cardiologists for cardiac involvement. The 
primary care physician must recognize the signs and symptoms of ATTR-CA and refer 
patients to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Cardiologists must possess 
knowledge of clinical presentation and diagnostic clues or red flags of CA and be able to integrate the biopsy and Tc-PYP imaging into the 
diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected ATTR-CA after ruling out AL-CA. 
Nuclear cardiologists must understand and adhere to proper Tc-PYP procedures, 
standardized testing protocols, and reporting in the hospital. Genetic counselors 
must provide counseling to the patients and their families and understand genetic 
testing and screening. Collaboration with gastroenterologists and neurologists is 
necessary to manage complications from gastrointestinal amyloid deposition, 
autonomic dysfunction, and polyneuropathy, respectively. Many patients with 
lumbar spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel syndrome can also develop CA, so orthopedics should also be able to identify patients who are at 
risk. Nephrologists must be involved as kidney involvement is present in about 
70% of patients with amyloidosis, particularly in AL [4, 27]. Multidisciplinary 
collaboration is also crucial in determining if any systemic involvement 
contraindicates a heart transplant in cases of advanced heart failure.

### 6.1 Identification of Diagnostic Red Flags

A high level of suspicion is fundamental in making the diagnosis of CA. Knowing 
typical patterns of disease presentation, diagnostic clues or red flags, and 
commonly affected demographics will help to order specific laboratory and imaging 
studies. For instance, if an older individual is hospitalized for heart failure 
and has elevated baseline troponin levels or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels that don’t match 
the clinical context, it could be a sign of ATTR-CA. Other indicators include 
hypertension that eventually goes away or needs down-titration of 
antihypertensives and an inability to tolerate beta-blockers or ACE 
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. Early clues or red flags to ATTR-CA may 
include bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, previous 
orthopedic procedures, and spontaneous biceps tendon rupture [23, 24].

### 6.2 Whom to Screen

Screening the right patient population is the bottom line for accurately 
identifying the disease. It is essential to consider the pretest probability of 
finding the disease before conducting the screening. For instance, non-invasive 
methods using cardiac scintigraphy can accurately diagnose ATTR-CA without 
needing a biopsy in specific clinical scenarios with about 100% specificity 
[25]. However, failing to consider the pretest probability and conducting the 
screening incorrectly can decrease the accuracy of diagnostic tests.

The diagnostic testing process starts with a high index of clinical suspicion

### 6.4 Role of Genetics

When diagnosis of ATTR-CA is confirmed with Tc-PYP cardiac scintigraphy, the

### 6.5 Multidisciplinary Collaboration

Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential for providing an opportunity for 
all specialists to collaborate and coordinate in providing expert-level 
comprehensive care to patients with CA in a single integrated setting. 
Cardiologists are the primary care providers for patients with ATTR-CA. At the

collaboration is also crucial in determining if any systemic involvement 
contraindicates a heart transplant in cases of advanced heart failure.

### 7. How to Sustain the Center

Consistently implementing the above steps is crucial for maintaining the 
center’s growth after its establishment, elaborated in Fig. 2. Educating community physicians 
periodically about the disease and its diagnostic clues or red flags will 
continue to identify high-risk patients and their early referral to the CA 
center. Educating patients about the condition will increase their likelihood of 
enrolling in medical care and participating in research. Proper use of the 
diagnostic algorithm and building an order set in the electronic medical record 
system to order diagnostic tools easily is imperative. Continuous screening is 
essential for identifying more patients and thus continues to improve the 
hospital’s financial burden, allowing for the growth and expansion of the CA 
center.

Steps to establish and sustain an amyloidosis center.

### 8. Conclusions

The majority of the patients seek medical care at the community hospital. Thus, 
it would be helpful to have a CA center in a community hospital 
setting to provide comprehensive care to the growing population of patients with 
CA. This manuscript aims to provide community-based hospitals 
with a framework to help establish their own designated, comprehensive CA center.
