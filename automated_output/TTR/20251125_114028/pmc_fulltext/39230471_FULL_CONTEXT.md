## Nonamyloidogenic TTR gene variants c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C are not associated with idiopathic small‐fiber neuropathy

### Abstract

AbstractBackground and PurposeSmall‐fiber neuropathy (SFN) affects only unmyelinated and thin myelinated fibers. It may be caused by amyloidogenic mutations of the transthyretin (TTR) gene, but not all TTR gene variants are pathogenic. The nonamyloidogenic c.76G>A (rs1800458) and c.337‐18G>C (rs36204272) variants of TTR were recently reported to be associated with SFN. We investigated this putative association by analyzing TTR gene sequencing data retrospectively for two cohorts of patients, one with SFN and a control group.MethodsIn this retrospective single‐center study, we analyzed the frequency of the c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C TTR gene variants in a cohort of patients meeting a strict definition of SFN, with or without dysautonomia, a control cohort of patients investigated for nonneurological conditions, and the gnomAD international database.ResultsWe included 55 SFN patients in this study, 17 of whom had dysautonomia. The allelic frequencies of the two variants in our cohort of 55 SFN patients were 7.27% for c.76G>A TTR and 5.25% for c.337‐18G>C. The frequencies of both variants were statistically similar in the 337 control patients and the gnomAD database.ConclusionsThe c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C TTR gene variants are not associated with SFN.

### INTRODUCTION

Small‐fiber neuropathy (SFN) affects the unmyelinated and thin myelinated small nerve fibers of the peripheral nervous system, causing neuropathic pain, thermal hypoesthesia, and/or dysautonomic symptoms [1]. There is no international consensus for SFN diagnosis. However, many authors define SFN as a combination of (i) evocative symptoms and abnormal clinical examination results, (ii) normal nerve conduction results demonstrating the sparing of large fibers, and (iii) at least one abnormal test result for small fibers from the following list: intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) on skin biopsy, quantitative sensory or sudomotor axon reflex testing, laser‐evoked potentials (LEPs), electrochemical skin conductance (ESC), and heart rate variability (HRV) [2, 3, 4, 5]. The symptoms of SFN can be identified through the use of published questionnaires, such as the SFN‐SIQ (SFN‐symptoms inventory questionnaire) [6] or an adapted form of Lauria's questionnaire (Data S1) [7]. European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (EFNS/PNS) guidelines for skin biopsies have been published, with recommendations for IENFD determinations on ankle and/or thigh skin biopsy specimens. The results obtained must be expressed relative to published norms for sex and age, with specification of the technical methods used [2, 8].

SFN has diverse causes, including diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption, and chemotherapy. It may also occur in contexts of autoimmune disorders (Gougerot‐Sjögren syndrome, sarcoidosis, celiac disease), metabolic diseases (vitamin B12 and/or B9 deficiency, hemochromatosis, dysthyroidism), and rare genetic disorders, including Fabry disease, hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv), and SCN9A/10A channelopathies. However, 50% of cases are considered idiopathic [9].

Transthyretin (TTR) is a tetrameric protein secreted principally by the liver. It binds thyroid hormone and retinol‐binding protein in the blood. Mutations of the TTR gene cause misfolding of the protein, resulting in familial amyloid polyneuropathy or ATTRv, a multisystemic disease in which amyloid is deposited in various organs, including the peripheral nerves, heart, leptomeninges, eyes, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract [10]. TTR gene variants are considered pathogenic if they fulfill the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria [11] and there is evidence of amyloid deposition [12].

There are many nonpathogenic (or nonamyloidogenic) TTR gene variants, and a number of variants of unknown clinical significance (VUSs). Levine and Bland recently sequenced the TTR genes of 44 patients with SFN, with or without autonomic symptoms. TTR VUSs c.76G>A (rs1800458, p.Gly26Ser) and c.337‐18G>C (rs36204272, intronic) were detected in 36% of these patients, with a frequency of 8% if SFN was not associated with dysautonomia and 68% if there was dysautonomia associated with SFN, although these results were not compared with a control group [13]. Thimm and coworkers detected the c.76G>A TTR variant in two of 26 patients with SFN [14]. In both studies, the authors suggested a possible association between variants c.76G>A (rs1800458, p.Gly26Ser) and c.337‐18G>C (rs36204272, intronic) of the TTR gene, which had been presumed to be nonpathogenic, and SFN.

We investigated the relationship between the supposed nonpathogenic c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C variants of the TTR gene and SFN by analyzing TTR gene sequencing results retrospectively for a large group of patients with SFN and a large group of controls.

### METHODS

The cohort of SFN patients for this study were consecutive patients diagnosed with SFN in the Neurology Department of Bicêtre Hospital between February 2017 and December 2020. All the patients included presented SFN, defined as a Lauria score > 2/15 (0–1 normal to 15 maximal impairment), reflecting symptoms of sensory or autonomic dysfunction (Data S1), nerve conduction results within the local range of normal values, and a low IENFD, defined as <70% of the norm for age and sex for skin from the ankle [15] and/or thigh [3]. They also had no history of diabetes, B12 insufficiency, dysthyroidism, monoclonal gammopathy, antinuclear antibodies, alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, chemotherapy, or TTR amyloidogenic mutation.

Skin biopsies were performed in accordance with EFNS/PNS guidelines [16], with double immunofluorescence labeling with anti‐PGP9.5 and anticollagen IV antibodies.

Dysautonomia was explored in all patients. It was defined as follows: (i) at least one of the dysautonomic symptoms considered for the Lauria score, (ii) asymptomatic orthostatic hypotension, and/or (iii) abnormal results on neurovegetative tests (HRV and/or sympathetic skin response).

When available, results of other small‐fiber tests, such as ESC, LEP, and HRV studies, were also collected.

Incidental TTR gene variants were identified retrospectively in a control cohort (CC) of patients screened in next generation sequencing (NGS) panels for multiple nonneurological conditions at our hospital (list of genes is provided in the Data S2).

gnomAD is an open‐source database of exome and genome sequencing data obtained in diverse large‐scale sequencing projects [17].

DNA was isolated from 5 mL of whole peripheral blood. SFN patients were then screened for TTR gene mutations by Sanger sequencing, whereas the samples from CC patients were subjected to NGS. Sanger sequencing was performed on genomic DNA for all four coding exons of the TTR gene. Mutations were numbered according to the Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature (National Center for Biotechnology Information reference sequence: NM_000371.3, TTR gene, HGNC: 12405). Traditional mutation names are also indicated. The variants of interest (VOIs) were the c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C variants described by Levine and Bland [13].

Allelic frequencies (AFs), defined as the relative frequency of an allele in a population, for the VOIs c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C were compared with those in the CC. The demographic data for the patients were analyzed to determine whether the AFs for the two VOIs in these two cohorts were associated with age, sex, or disease. AFs were then compared with those reported in gnomAD (accessed on 2 October 2021) and were compared between patients with and without autonomic neuropathy, to determine whether these variants were associated with dysautonomia in SFN patients.

Statistical analysis was performed with R studio (https://cran.r‐project.org/ v4.0.0). Pearson chi‐squared test with Yates correction for continuity was used where possible for comparisons of AFs. If the necessary assumptions for a valid chi‐squared test did not hold, Fisher exact tests for count data were used.

All patients (SFN cohort and the CC) gave written informed consent for genetic screening in accordance with French and international guidelines. A skin biopsy is routinely performed during the diagnostic procedure for SFN. Our institutional ethics committee (Bicêtre University Hospital, Public Hospital Network of Paris) ruled that our standard written informed consent form, which includes a statement on the conservation of samples for research and is signed by all participants before the performance of a biopsy, was sufficient for the purposes of this study.

### Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consent

All patients (SFN cohort and the CC) gave written informed consent for genetic screening in accordance with French and international guidelines. A skin biopsy is routinely performed during the diagnostic procedure for SFN. Our institutional ethics committee (Bicêtre University Hospital, Public Hospital Network of Paris) ruled that our standard written informed consent form, which includes a statement on the conservation of samples for research and is signed by all participants before the performance of a biopsy, was sufficient for the purposes of this study.

### RESULTS

The CC comprised 377 patients, whereas the SFN cohort comprised 55 patients with idiopathic SFN, including 17 with dysautonomia (see demographic data in Table 1). Skin biopsies were performed for all 55 SFN patients, and 11 of these patients also underwent labial salivary gland biopsies. None of these biopsies provided any evidence of amyloid deposition. Other small‐fiber tests were performed for 52 of our 55 SFN patients. These tests included LEP (n = 12), ESC (n = 49), and HRV (n = 31) tests. The results of these tests were abnormal in 30 of the 52 patients tested, including five for whom abnormal results were obtained in two or more tests.

Result based on the data available.

Twelve of the 55 SFN patients (22%) harbored at least one of the two VOIs; six (11%) carried only the c.76G>A variant, four (7%) carried only the c.337‐18G>C variant, and two (4%) carried both variants (see AFs in Table 2). The AFs of these variants in our SFN cohort were, therefore, 7.27% for c.76G>A and 5.45% for c.337‐18G>C.

We found that 34 of the 377 CC patients (9%, AF = 4.77%) carried the c.76G>A variant (including two homozygotes), whereas 32 (8%, AF = 4.38%) harbored the c.337‐18G>C variant (including one homozygote). The AF of the two VOIs displayed no statistically significant differences between the sexes, or according to age or disease (chi‐squared tests for sex: p = 0.417 for c.76G>A and p = 1 for c.337‐18G>C, Fisher exact tests for age and disease: p = 0.761 and p = 0.584, respectively, for c.76G>A; and p = 0.477 and p = 0.482, respectively, for c.337‐18G>C).

In gnomAD, the AF for c.76G>A was 5.14% and that for c.337‐18G>C was 5.74% (accessed on 2 October 2021).

The AFs of the two VOIs did not differ significantly between the CC and gnomAD (Fisher exact test: p = 0.741 for c.76G>A and p = 0.116 for c.337‐18G>C). These results suggest that the CC was a good control population for the comparison of AFs.

AFs in the SFN cohort did not differ significantly from those for the CC (chi‐squared test, p = 0.304 for c.76G>A and p = 1 for c.337‐18G>C) and reported in gnomAD (chi‐squared test, p = 0.426 for c.76G>A and p = 1 for c.337‐18G>C).

There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients carrying at least one of the two VOIs between the SFN cohort and our CC (chi‐squared test, p = 0.426).

We also found no significant difference in the frequencies of the VOIs between patients with and without autonomic neuropathy, as 23% of the patients diagnosed with isolated SFN (8/38) and 24% of those diagnosed with SFN associated with autonomic neuropathy (4/17) had at least one of the two VOIs (Fisher test: p = 1).

### AFs of the VOIs

Twelve of the 55 SFN patients (22%) harbored at least one of the two VOIs; six (11%) carried only the c.76G>A variant, four (7%) carried only the c.337‐18G>C variant, and two (4%) carried both variants (see AFs in Table 2).

In gnomAD, the AF for c.76G>A was 5.14% and that for c.337‐18G>C was 5.74% (accessed on 2 October 2021).

### Comparison of AFs of VOIs between SFN patients, CC, and gnomAD

The AFs of the two VOIs did not differ significantly between the CC and gnomAD (Fisher exact test: p = 0.741 for c.76G>A and p = 0.116 for c.337‐18G>C). These results suggest that the CC was a good control population for the comparison of AFs.

AFs in the SFN cohort did not differ significantly from those for the CC (chi‐squared test, p = 0.304 for c.76G>A and p = 1 for c.337‐18G>C) and reported in gnomAD (chi‐squared test, p = 0.426 for c.76G>A and p = 1 for c.337‐18G>C).

There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients carrying at least one of the two VOIs between the SFN cohort and our CC (chi‐squared test, p = 0.426).

We also found no significant difference in the frequencies of the VOIs between patients with and without autonomic neuropathy, as 23% of the patients diagnosed with isolated SFN (8/38) and 24% of those diagnosed with SFN associated with autonomic neuropathy (4/17) had at least one of the two VOIs (Fisher test: p = 1).

### DISCUSSION

We found no significant difference in the AFs of the two VOIs between SFN patients, controls, and the gnomAD cohort. Our findings do not, therefore, support the existence of an association between the c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C TTR variants and SFN.

For the purposes of this study, SFN was defined strictly in accordance with guidelines based on IENFD [16, 18]. Small‐fiber abnormalities were confirmed in other tests for 58% of the patients. We chose a cutoff of 70% of the normal value for IENFD to ensure that the definition of small‐fiber neuropathy was strict, because no other confirmatory tests for small‐fiber involvement other than skin biopsy were routinely performed for our patients. Several authors have reported the reproducibility of results to be poor between different methods of small‐fiber examination [3, 4, 19]. We chose to rely essentially on marked quantitative cutaneous denervation in this study assessing the relationship of TTR gene variants to small‐fiber neuropathy. Cutaneous denervation occurs early and is pronounced in TTR amyloid neuropathy [20].

We found no evidence of an association of either of the two variants with SFN, with or without autonomic involvement. We compared our findings with the frequencies of these two variants in the gnomAD database, a widely used genomic database containing data from around the world, and in a local control cohort, to prevent possible bias due to an effect endemic to France. This method makes it possible to avoid the overinterpretation of the results for this SFN cohort obtained in isolation, through comparison with a local control cohort and an international database, constituting an improvement on the methodology used in previous studies [13, 14].

No amyloid deposits were found in the skin or labial salivary gland biopsy specimens of our SFN patients, suggesting that both the VOIs are benign or nonpathogenic. Treatments for TTR amyloidosis are not, therefore, recommended for patients carrying these variants.

Our data suggest that the two VOIs, c.76G>A and c.337‐18G>C TTR, should remain in ACMG class III, and should be considered as likely benign or nonpathogenic for SFN. Genetic counseling and family screening are not, therefore, recommended for carriers. The frequencies of these variants in patients with large‐fiber neuropathies should also be explored.
