## Genetic and Epidemiological Insights into 
RAB32
‐Linked Parkinson's Disease

### Abstract

AbstractBackgroundThe p.Ser71Arg RAB32 variant was recently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD).ObjectiveThe aim was to investigate the presence of RAB32 variants in a large multiethnic group of individuals affected and unaffected by PD.MethodsWe queried our proprietary database that contains exome/genome sequencing data of >180,000 individuals. Additional PD patients were genotyped, and proximal p.Ser71Arg‐associated haplotypes were constructed.Resultsp.Ser71Arg was present in 11 PD patients (73% from northern Italy) and in 35 individuals (89% from the Middle East and North Africa [MENA]) aged <50 years without PD‐relevant symptoms. It was found in‐cis to a set of proximal single‐nucleotide polymorphisms. Additional RAB32 variants were comparably frequent in PD and non‐PD individuals.ConclusionsThe RAB32 p.Ser71Arg variant defines a cluster of PD patients in northern Italy. Globally, it is most prevalent in MENA. Our data indicate that p.Ser71Arg causes PD and that it occurred only once, through a founder event. Other RAB32 variants are unlikely to cause PD. © 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Patients and Methods

The primary querying steps utilized CENTOGENE's biological data bank CentoMD.
11
 This repository consists of diverse types of data from research‐consented individuals referred to CENTOGENE GmbH for genetic testing; its overall composition is global, but there is a predominance of individuals from the Middle East. First, we identified all 182,187 individuals with available whole‐exome/whole‐genome sequencing data (because RAB32 has been assessed by only either of these two comprehensive genetic testing approaches). Of note, of these individuals, 9404 were participants in the Rostock International Parkinson's Disease (ROPAD) study and thus PD patients, whereas 172,783 had been referred in various types of diagnostic settings (routine exome/genome‐based genetic testing, healthy parents from trio analyses, or participants of other observational clinical studies) and had no PD‐compatible symptoms. From this group, we defined all individuals in whom RAB32 p.Ser71Arg was called with quality parameters that exclude false positivity.
12
 Demographic and clinical data were then extracted for variant‐positive individuals, and the setting in which the individual's sample was received (routine diagnostics, observational clinical study, etc.) was documented. Appropriate in‐house case/control groups of individuals were compiled based on the following stratification criteria: p.Ser71Arg positivity, RAB32 variant positivity, geographic origin, and PD clinical status. The latter stratification was based on whether an individual was a participant in the PD‐focused ROPAD study. The details of the genetic and statistical analyses are provided in the Supporting Information.

### Results

Querying of all existing in‐house whole‐exome/whole‐genome sequencing data from 182,187 individuals identified 44 individuals in whom exome or genome sequencing revealed the heterozygous presence of RAB32 p.Ser71Arg.

Nine of the 44 individuals were PD patients from the ROPAD study.

 Their phenotypic details are currently being collected and will be presented elsewhere. They were identified among 9404 study participants who had been exome/genome sequenced. Thus, the frequency of the RAB32 p.Ser71Arg variant in this group of globally enrolled PD patients was 0.048%. Of the 9 variant carriers from the ROPAD study, 6 were from Italy, and 3 were from Germany, Spain, and Turkey. The Italian patients originated from Pavia or Reggio Emilia, representing two of the eight Italian ROPAD sites and both being located in northern Italy. Prompted by this observation, we genotyped all additional ROPAD participants from northern Italy. With two more p.Ser71Arg‐positive individuals identified through this effort, the MAF in PD patients from northern Italy was 0.417% (8 of 960 patients). Of the 11 variant‐positive PD patients, 2 were men and 9 were women, and their mean age at onset (±standard deviation [SD]) was 55.5(±7.5) years, whereas their mean age at enrollment (±SD) was 63.9 ± 10.6 years.

The remaining 35 of the 44 initially identified p.Ser71Arg‐positive individuals were identified among 172,783 individuals (MAF: 0.01%) who (1) had been referred in various types of diagnostic settings, (2) were not affected by PD, and (3) were largely infants or parents in their 20s to 30s. Strikingly, 31 of these 35 individuals were from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The resulting internal MENA‐specific MAF was 0.016%, with Saudi Arabia showing a particularly high MAF of 0.023%. These figures are five‐ to eightfold higher than the internal MAF of 0.003% in non‐MENA countries (P <0.0001 for both comparisons).

In all 17 variant‐positive individuals with genome sequencing data available, we observed the same set of 15 heterozygous SNPs in the ±12‐kb region surrounding p.Ser71Arg (Fig. 1A). Long‐range polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and phasing by “genome walking” revealed a single proximal p.Ser71Arg haplotype, which, of note, included another ultrarare variant (T‐allele of rs888410254) (Fig. 1B). There were four distinct proximal haplotypes on the other alleles (Fig. 1C). Although the latter represented the most common haplotypes at the locus, the allele combination for the high‐MAF SNPs on the p.Ser71Arg haplotype was not among the haplotypes that contributed more than 1% in 1000Genomes (Fig. 1C).

Finally, we aimed to investigate whether other RAB32 variants were linked to PD. For this, we focused on the 9404 ROPAD participants who had been exome‐ or genome‐sequenced. Three of them carried heterozygous RAB32 loss‐of‐function (LoF) variants. The resulting cumulative MAF of 0.016% was comparable to the corresponding MAF of 0.019% for RAB32 LoF variants in 36,007 country‐matched non‐ROPAD individuals with exomes/genomes available. Similarly, the cumulative MAF for RAB32 missense variants in ROPAD participants (0.31%) did not significantly differ from the cumulative MAF in non‐ROPAD individuals (0.37%). A subsequent extension of the analysis to the level of the individual variant focused on the eight missense alterations that were observed at least thrice in ROPAD participants. Of those, p.Ser71Arg was the only variant for which the frequency significantly differed between ROPAD participants and country‐matched non‐ROPAD individuals. Figure 2 shows all corresponding counts and visualizes odds ratios and confidence intervals.

### Discussion

The present study provides novel insights into the geographic and variant causality‐related aspects of PARK‐RAB32. The probably most important finding is the identification of an apparently large cluster of patients in northern Italy. This observation is of high relevance for the timely setup of a clinical trial that tests the attractive hypothesis that LRRK2 inhibition, currently a well‐accepted therapeutic approach in PARK‐LRRK2,
16
 may also be beneficial for PARK‐RAB32 patients.
5

Our identification of additional LoF and missense RAB32 changes and their analysis in large case–control groups indicates that variants other than p.Ser71Arg are unlikely to cause PD. This discovery is important for several reasons. First, the apparent nonrelevance of RAB32 LoF alleles represents strong additional support for the presumed gain‐of‐function mutational mechanism in PARK‐RAB32.
5
 This phenomenon resembles that of other autosomal dominant PD proteins such as LRRK2,
17
 VPS35,
18
 and potentially also GBA1.
19
 Second, the phenomenon of disease‐causing LRRK2 activation to be conferred by a single variant resembles PARK‐VPS35.
20
 Third, our analysis will be of relevance for PD genetic diagnostics: the non‐p.Ser71Arg RAB32 variants covered by the present study will more easily be classifiable as benign or likely benign (rather than as variants of uncertain significance).
21

Another remarkable novel finding is the strong enrichment of RAB32 variant p.Ser71Arg in the MENA region. This observation represents the major explanation for the MAF of 0.01% based on our internal database being 10‐fold higher than the MAF in gnomAD (ie, individuals from this geographic region are much more strongly represented in our database than in gnomAD).
8
 It is further supported by the previous identification of numerous Tunisian PARK‐RAB32 patients.
5
 The geographic distribution of the variant thereby overlaps with that of other PD‐associated variants, such as LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser
22
 and variants in GBA1.
23
, 
24
 This may be interpreted as support for the long‐standing hypothesis that a “local evolutionary survival” of variants in lysosome biology–linked genes is explained by a selective advantage in certain immunological settings.
25

Our identification of 35 individuals without PD symptoms but harboring the p.Ser71Arg RAB32 variant does not dispute the role of this change in PD. That is, almost all these individuals were aged <50 years at referral, that is, too young to exhibit the PARK‐RAB32 clinical phenotype (that on average manifests at the age of 55 years) but certainly at risk.

Our data from the phasing of proximal variants in p.Ser71Arg‐positive samples support the postulated existence of a single p.Ser71Arg‐associated haplotype (Fig. 1).
5
, 
6
 Particularly strong evidence came from our observation of p.Ser71Arg being in linkage disequilibrium with another ultrarare variant (T‐allele of rs888410254) and from the coverage of novel geographic regions. Knowledge of haplotype homogeneity versus diversity for a given disease‐causing variant is critical for patient stratification. A prominent example is the TTR p.Val30Met variant, for which the resulting hATTR phenotype is strongly haplotype dependent.
26

The following limitations apply to our study: (1) the claimed geographic hot spots may be explained by unrecognized bias regarding study enrollment (PD patients in northern Italy) and diagnostic referral (non‐PD individuals from the MENA region), (2) our observation of only a single p.Ser71Arg‐associated haplotype does not decisively exclude the existence of other haplotypes, and (3) additional RAB32 variants, absent from the present study or too rare to be analyzed, may be causally connected to PD.

Finally, it should be emphasized that the present study leverages proprietary clinical‐genetic data. It thereby represents yet another example of how the underlying meticulously curated database
11
 can be used to reveal important insights that are invaluable for diagnostic laboratories, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies.
27
, 
28
 Having the benefit of patients in mind, we therefore encourage other commercial entities to consider similar secondary use and publication of their proprietary data.
