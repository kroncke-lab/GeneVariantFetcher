# MAIN TEXT

## A new transthyretin variant (Ser 24) associated with familial amyloid polyneuropathy.

### Abstract

An American kindred with systemic amyloidosis presenting with carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy is reported. The transthyretin gene of a patient was analysed by direct DNA sequencing and both cytosine and thymine were present at the first base of codon 24. This new point mutation in exon 2 results in the amino acid substitution of serine for proline in the A-B loop of the transthyretin molecule. DNA testing for this mutant allele by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis based on the polymerase chain reaction is described.Images
