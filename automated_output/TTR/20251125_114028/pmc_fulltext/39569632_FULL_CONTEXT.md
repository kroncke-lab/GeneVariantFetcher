## Structure and Stabilities of Solution and Gas Phase
Protein Complexes

### Abstract

Collision-induced
unfolding (CIU) has provided new levels of understanding
of the stabilities and structure(s) for gas phase protein and protein
complex ions formed by electrospray ionization (ESI). Variable-temperature
(vT-ESI) data provide complementary information about temperature-induced
folding/unfolding (TIU) reactions of solution phase ions. Results
obtained by using CIU and TIU provide complementary information about
stabilities of gas phase versus solution phase ions. Such comparisons
may provide the most direct experimental approach to answer a long-standing
question from Fred McLafferty: “For how long, under what conditions,
and to what extent, can solution structure be retained without solvent?”
Answers to this question require greater understanding of the (i)
structure(s), stabilities, and dynamics of proteins/protein complexes
in solution prior to ESI; (ii) effects of water removal by droplet
fission and “freeze-drying” by evaporation of water
from the nanodroplet; and (iii) potential reactions and structural
changes that may occur as the ions traverse the heated capillary,
the final stage in the transition to solvent-free gas phase ions.
Here, we employ vT-ESI coupled with ion mobility-mass spectrometry
(IM-MS) as a means to provide more detailed answers to the above-mentioned
questions. Apo- and metalated-metallothionein-2A (MT), a cysteine-rich
metal binding protein, and various proteoforms of transthyretin (TTR),
a homotetrameric (56 kDa) retinol and thyroxine transporter protein
complex were studied to examine distinct features of CIU and TIU across
two different types of protein complexes. The results in this work
shed light on the capabilities of CIU, TIU, and average charge state
(Zavg) for probing the rugged energy landscape of native
proteins and highlights the effects of water and cofactors (metal
ions) on the structure and stabilities of proteins and protein complexes.

### Introduction

Structures, stabilities, and dynamics
of proteins and protein complexes
are influenced by interactions with other molecules, and water is
an especially important participant in these folding and restructuring
processes.1 Moreover, many of the effects
on protein folding and restructuring reactions that are attributed
to cofactor, osmolytes, and ligand binding are in fact direct effects
of changes in hydration of the protein.2 Collectively, the effects of noncovalent interactions and hydration
modulate the protein folding landscape by altering the contributions
of enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (TΔS) to the energy folding landscape. Hydration
stabilizes proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with polar amino acids
on the protein surface, and temperature has direct influence on the
dynamics of water that can promote restructuring processes, especially
under cold and hot conditions.3,4 The combined effects
of hydration and temperature on protein folding and restructuring
are noteworthy, with the hydration of biomolecules being largely entropically
driven.5,6 In the case of large, polar biomolecules,
limited here to proteins and protein complexes, multiple low energy
conformational states are possible, which is best illustrated by the
“rugged energy landscape” (REL) (see Figure 1).7,8 The
REL harbors rich conformational entropy (conformation states) in which
kinetic or thermodynamic traps are present for “non-native”
states (microstates)9 that may be “hidden”
from experimental approaches that report ensemble averaged data, viz.,
isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron
spectroscopy.10,11 Understanding the roles and mapping
the conformational entropy of the REL are important when considering
that these native-like and non-native protein states may underly the
aberrant behavior that may lead to malfunction and even disease.

There is a growing realization that electrospray ionization combined
with ion mobility-mass spectrometry (ESI-IM-MS) has unique potential
to provide more complete mapping of the protein REL,12−15 viz. effects of solution temperature, pH, ionic strength, presence/absence
of cofactors/osmolytes and solvent on protein structure, stabilities,
and dynamics.13,16 When combined with nano-ESI (nESI),
which provides rapid cooling (130–150 K) of protein-containing
nanodroplets described as “freeze-dried biomolecules”,17 IM-MS allows analysis of the kinetically trapped
conformers present that make up the REL.18 Combining nESI with IM-MS affords measurements of mass-to-charge
ratios, average charge state (Zavg), and size-to-charge
ratios (collision cross section, CCS) of the ions. Moreover, variable-temperature
with IM-MS (vT-ESI-IM-MS) otherwise known as temperature induced unfolding
(TIU), can determine the effects of solution temperature within the
ESI emitter (from ∼2–98 °C) on Zavg,
ion abundances, and changes in CCS of reactants and products.19 Continued development of techniques such as
TIU, may allow for greater insight into solution phase dynamics of
biomolecules such as the ones in this work.

Native mass spectrometry
(nMS) studies comparing solution and gas
phase ions have a rich history;20−23 however, the importance of the stabilization effects
of water in solution and the transition of ions from solution to the
gas phase is less understood.14,20,24−26 Collision-induced unfolding (CIU) is used to compare
stabilities of gas phase ions (intact proteins and protein complexes)
by measuring changes of the CCS as the collisional activation energies
are increased.20−23 CIU of gas phase ions is primarily an enthalpically driven process,
whereas vT-ESI (cold and hot) reports on conformational changes that
are induced by changes in temperature and hydration, both of which
can be from enthalpy and entropy driven processes.1,3,4,27−30 As a general rule, cold temperatures promote the formation of compact
ions, whereas higher temperatures favor extended conformers. An exception
is the phenomenon of cold unfolding, in which the increased hydration
of hydrophobic residues promotes formation of extended conformers.3,31,32 CIU of the gas phase ions can
be directly monitored with IM-MS by monitoring changes in the CCS
of the ions. Conformational changes induced by changes in solution
temperature can also be determined by IM-MS, but oftentimes changes
in CCS are too small to be detected; see REL (Figure 1) and note that the activation energies for
transitioning among the available states lie well below that for escaping
the population of native-like states.7 Temperature-induced
conformational changes may result in changes of the solvent accessible
surface area (SASA) which can be detected by changes in Zavg, thereby revealing the presence of microstates (viz. REL) within
the native and native-like states..19,24,25,33−36 The results of this study further illustrate the complementary information
obtained using CIU and TIU, and may yield new strategies for better
understanding the linkage between structures of solution and gas phase
ions.

### Experimental Section

Equine cytochrome c, equine
myoglobin, bovine
ubiquitin, ammonium acetate, LC-MS grade water, LC-MS grade methanol,
tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), pentetic acid
(DTPA), cadmium acetate, copper acetate, and silver acetate were purchased
from Millipore-Sigma (Burlington, MA). LC-MS grade acetic acid was
purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA). Bio-Spin 6 kDa MWCO SEC
desalting columns were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules,
CA) and used for buffer exchanges.

Human metallothionein-2A
(MT) was expressed and purified as previously described.37 Aliquots of apo-MT (15 μM) were buffer
exchanged into a 50 mM ammonium acetate solution with 1 mM TCEP and
10% %v/v methanol. The metalation of MT has been previously discussed,
but briefly Cd4, Ag4, and Cu6-MT
were prepared by titration of apo-MT with metal-acetate solutions.38 Tetrameric wild-type transthyretin (wt-TTR)
was expressed and purified as previously described by Shirzadeh et
al.39 Multiple TTR mutants were expressed
and purified using the same method starting from different constructs.
All TTR samples were buffer exchanged into 200 mM ammonium acetate
and diluted to 5 μM for charge state measurement and 10 μM
for CCS measurement to ensure a better signal. For TTR vT-ESI on the
Thermo Fisher Q-Exactive UHMR (Santa Clara, CA), TTR aliquots were
diluted in half with 1 M ammonium acetate and 3 mM DTPA before the
buffer was exchanged into 200 mM ammonium acetate to remove zinc ions.

CIU experiments were
performed as previously described for the Waters (Manchester, UK)
traveling wave ion-mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS) Synapt G2 instrument
using nESI38,40 with instrument tuning conditions
that minimize unwanted collisional activation of the initially formed
ions (Table S1).20 The ions of interest were subjected to collisional activation (CA)
prior to IM-MS via trap collision voltage. Different trap collision
energies were applied by changing the voltage drop (increments of
5 V for MT and 15 V for TTR) between the exit of the quadrupole and
the entrance to the TWIG region, which was filled with argon. The
activation energies are reported as the laboratory frame collision
energy, which was calculated as the product of the ion charge and
trap collision voltage. CA data was compiled as CIU heat maps, using
CIUSuite2 software40,41 creating two-dimensional plots
of CCS versus laboratory frame energy using the 2D smoothing method
with smoothing window size and iterations as 5 and 1, respectively.
The x-axis (lab frame energy) was interpolated by
using an axis scaling factor of 2. CIU50 values were extracted from
the CA data by using the standard fitting routine. Standard feature
detection parameters were 3 minimum feature length, 0 maximum CV gap
length, and 50 and 100 feature allowed width for MT and TTR, respectively.
Standard CIU50 parameters used were max spectral centroiding mode,
0 maximum CV gap length, and 50 and 200 transition region padding
for MT and TTR, respectively. The CCS in nitrogen buffer gas were
determined using a TWIMS calibration of cytochrome c, myoglobin, and
ubiquitin in water/methanol/acetic acid (49:49:2) as described previously
for each different instrument tuning.42

Variable-temperature
experiments were performed using a 3-stage thermoelectric chip (Peltier)
static nESI device that can modulate temperatures from (5–80
°C ± 2 °C) that has been described elsewhere.19 Temperatures were measured in sequential order
from cold to hot in 5 °C increments, with the nESI emitter equilibrated
at each temperature for 3 min prior to any measurement. All the vT-
IM-MS (TIU) measurements were performed on a Waters Synapt G2 instrument
using low gas phase activation tuning (Table S2). TIU heatmaps were generated using CIUSuite2 with the same software
parameters stated above for plotting CIU heatmaps. Average charge
states were measured using a ThermoFisher Q-Exactive UHMR instrument
with parameters stated in supplemental Table S3. The TTR data was analyzed using the Zavg function in
Unidec,43 while MT data was analyzed manually
using the relative abundances of the 4+ and 5+ charge states using
the Zavg equation discussed elsewhere.44

### Ion-Mobility Mass Spectrometry

CIU experiments were

traveling wave ion-mobility mass spectrometry (TWIMS) Synapt G2 instrument
using nESI38,40 with instrument tuning conditions
that minimize unwanted collisional activation of the initially formed

ubiquitin in water/methanol/acetic acid (49:49:2) as described previously
for each different instrument tuning.42

### Variable Temperature Mass Spectrometry

Variable-temperature
experiments were performed using a 3-stage thermoelectric chip (Peltier)
static nESI device that can modulate temperatures from (5–80
°C ± 2 °C) that has been described elsewhere.19 Temperatures were measured in sequential order
from cold to hot in 5 °C increments, with the nESI emitter equilibrated
at each temperature for 3 min prior to any measurement. All the vT-
IM-MS (TIU) measurements were performed on a Waters Synapt G2 instrument
using low gas phase activation tuning (Table S2). TIU heatmaps were generated using CIUSuite2 with the same software
parameters stated above for plotting CIU heatmaps. Average charge
states were measured using a ThermoFisher Q-Exactive UHMR instrument
with parameters stated in supplemental Table S3. The TTR data was analyzed using the Zavg function in
Unidec,43 while MT data was analyzed manually
using the relative abundances of the 4+ and 5+ charge states using
the Zavg equation discussed elsewhere.44

### Results and Discussion

Here, CIU
and TIU are used to compare the structure(s), stabilities,
and dynamics of gas phase and solution phase MT and TTR ions. The
protein complexes were chosen for this study because they represent
two different but important types of biological systems that have
been extensively studied by many different research groups using very
different experimental approaches.38,39,45−53 Our approach focuses on answering two questions related to the questions
proposed by Fred McLafferty: (i) how are the physiochemical properties
of these complexes influenced by solvent and (ii) are solution phase
structures retained by the gas phase ions?20,54 The CIU studies on MT are designed to access the effects of specific
cofactors (i.e., metal ions) on conformational stabilities that can
then be compared to solution thermal stabilities. vT-ESI studies may
answer questions such as does solution temperature-dependent changes
(cold vs hot) alter the coordination of the metal ion? While numerous
MT metalated products are formed by reactions with Cd2+, Ag+, and Cu+, we will focus on the cooperatively
formed Cd4-MT5+, Ag4-MT5+, and Cux-MT5+ (x = 4, 6,
and 10).38,40,47 The TTR studies
are limited to wt-TTR and V122I, L55P, V30M, F87A, and T119M mutants.
The role of water on the structure and stabilities of wt- and mutant-TTR
has been investigated by others,45,53,55,56 and it has been found
that each of these mutants has very different stabilities under certain
environmental conditions. Moreover, our studies focus on comparing
stabilities in cold versus hot water and what happens when that water
is removed.

Figure 2A contains mass spectra for
apo- and metalated (Cd2+, Ag+ and Cu+) MT-2A. The metalation of MT by Cd2+, Ag+ and
Cu+ exhibits a high degree of cooperative binding as shown
previously,37,38 and these spectra were taken
at points in the metal titration where product ion abundances were
at a maximum. Figure 2B contains Zavg plots for apo- and metalated product ions
as a function of nESI emitter solution temperature (5–70 °C).
The effect of temperature on Zavg for apo-MT is much larger
compared to that of the metalated MTs (Cd4-MT Ag4-MT and Cu6-MT). Moreover, the increase in Zavg with temperature provides evidence for changes in conformation or
SASA even upon metalation. The decrease in Zavg from 55–60
°C was only observed for apo-MT, which may be indicative of some
significant structural rearrangement at these higher temperatures
such as annealing. Deviation in Zavg for apo- and metalated-MTs
are indicative of differences in SASA and apo-MT having the highest
Zavg is likely due to the higher conformational entropy
of apo-MT. The various metalated-MTs exhibited very similar solution
thermal stability in the Zavg experiment. These data provide
evidence that metalation is most important to MT’s stability
rather than the composition of metals bound.

(A) Mass spectra of apo-
and metalated MT at selected temperatures;
5+ ions are labeled in red and 4+ ions are labeled
in blue. The asterisks (*) denote unreacted apo-MT and low-abundance
metalated products for the MT5+ ions (Cd7, Ag6, Cu4, and Cu10). (B) Average charge
states for apo- and partially metalated MT ions of the highest abundance
species in the spectra; error bars represent standard deviations of
replicates with the same nESI emitter (n = 3).

Figure 3 contains
plots for CCS vs thermal activation and collisional activation for
apo-MT5+ and metalated-MT5+ ions shown as CIU
plots, and the CCS profiles used to generate these plots are shown
in Figures S1 and S2. TIU data in Figure 3A show that apo-MT
has two distinct conformations across the entire temperature range,
which is not observed for any of the metalated-MT, underscoring the
important role of metal binding on the conformational entropy for
MT-metal product ions. This is consistent with the changes observed
for Zavg for all metalated MT discussed vide supra. The
fwhm of the TIU CCS profiles for Cu4-, Cu10-,
and Cd4-MT increase with temperature by approximately 7%,
30%, and 28%, respectively (Figure S1).
These trends are very different for Cu6- and Ag4-MT as their CCS profiles decrease in fwhm (decreased conformational
entropy), indicating that certain coordination numbers and metal types
yield different solution thermal stabilities. Moreover, the Cu4-MT and Cu10MT complex is annealed or adopts a
molten globule state that then forms more compact conformations, but
at temperatures above ∼60 °C low abundance extended conformers
are formed for Cu4-MT (see Figure 3A).57 This observation
suggests that these metal bound states can adopt numerous Cu+ coordinated configurations. We previously showed that Cu4-MT is formed by addition of 4 Cu+ ions to the α-domain
and Cu10-MT followed by addition of 6 Cu+ ions
to the β-domain.38 Evidently, the
dynamics of the metalated α- and β-domains are not coupled,
and the peak broadening at high temperatures is evidence for restructuring
of the complex at higher temperatures. Data for apo-MT4+ and metalated-MT4+ ions are shown in Figure S8; note that the thermal unfolding and collisional
activation of 4+ ions have negligible effects on the CCS.
The different TIU profiles for MT4+ and MT5+ are further evidence for solvent induced conformational differences.
Reason(s) for these differences are unknown; consequently, the following
discussion will be limited to the 5+ ions.

(A) TIU heat maps (5–70
°C) for 5+ apo-MT,
Cd4-MT, Ag4-MT, Cu4-MT, Cu6-MT, and Cu10-MT. CCS profiles used to generate the TIU
heat maps are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). (B) CIU heat maps for apo- and metalated MT with
raw 5+ CCS profiles used to generate data are shown in the Supporting
Information (see Figure S2). For each of
the metalated MTs CIU, there appears to be two main ion populations,
one family of conformers with CCS centered at ∼750 Å2 and a larger CCS that differs for each metal. These differences
are related to the cooperative metal coordination within the α-
and β-domains.37,38

The CIU heat maps in Figure 3B indicate that MT gas phase stability increases upon metalation.
Each metalation (number and metal type) differs in their final unfolded
CCS, which is dependent on the metal coordination within the α-
and β-domains.38,40 CIUSuite2 CIU50 values were extracted
to compare initial to final conformer transition energies (see Figures S5 and S7A).41 Cu10-MT shows the highest CIU50 value at 137.6 eV, compared
with apo-MT that is unfolded from the beginning (<25 eV) and all
other metalated-MT had a CIU50 of ∼62 eV. These data show there
is no significant reduction in unfolding with different metal coordination
(Cd2+, Ag+, and Cu+), but the presence
and stoichiometry of metal binding can increase MT’s gas phase
stability.

The MT data provide evidence that gas phase and solution
phase
techniques sample different unfolding pathways along the REL for protein
complexes. CIU data reveal that apo and metalated MT unfold readily
with minimal collision energy. This indicates that the structure of
the MT is unstable in the gas phase. Conversely, the TIU data reveal
that the protein does not unfold significantly at any of the temperatures
sampled; indirect evidence that water has stabilizing effects on the
complex. It is important to note, however, that the conformational
entropy does increase for certain MT-metal complexes (Cd4-, Cu4-, and Cu10-MT) with increased temperature
observed with TIU and all MT-metal complexes for Zavg measurements.
This indicates that differences in interaction with water molecules
alter the conformational entropy of the MT proteoforms. It is therefore
possible that stabilization of the MT structure in solution is due
to the surrounding water molecules that interact with the protein.
The phenomenon of water molecule stabilization has been shown for
many other protein–protein and protein–ligand systems.2,55 This suggests that entropic contributions by solvent play a part
in stabilizing the MT structure, preventing the unfolding of MT and
MT-metal complexes under destabilizing conditions (higher temperatures),
and revealing the importance of water for the stabilization of protein-metal
complexes that has not been studied in the current literature.

The following experiments
are designed to better understand the structure(s), stability, and
dynamics of intact wt-TTR and TTR mutants. We and others have shown
that under certain experimental conditions (pH, ionic strength, and
temperature) wt-TTR and TTR mutants disassemble to form monomers and
dimers.39,51,53,55 The results in this work provide evidence for the
disassembly of TTR at various temperature values. At 80 °C, wt-
and mutant TTR complexes disassemble to form abundant monomers (Figure S10), while the F87A mutant completely
disassembles to monomers and dimers at temperatures of ∼65
°C (see Figure 4), and V122I has some low abundance of monomers throughout the temperature
range examined.

Mass spectra of wt- and mutant TTR at various temperatures
using
the vT-ESI device. Tetramers, monomers, dimers and the highest charge
state of the tetramers are labeled in the spectra. F87A and V122I
are the only mutants with significant amounts of monomer and/or dimer
present at any temperature. Note that F87A consists primarily of monomers
at 65 °C due to its low tetramer stability relative to the other
TTR mutants.

Zavg has been shown
previously to examine nuanced changes
in structure that may not be resolvable using IM-MS.19 The Zavg values for WT-TTR and TTR mutants change
significantly in the temperature range of 5 to 80 °C indicating
there is a change in SASA when the solution temperature is changed
(see Figures 5 and 6A). Notably, there is a slight increase in Zavg at the colder temperatures for all samples (<20 °C),
which we interpret as evidence of cold unfolding due to hydration
of the nonpolar regions pertinent to protein folding.3 V30M and L55P exhibit a higher Zavg relative
to wt-TTR (Figure 5A), which may be related to their location on the peripheral part
of the structure (see Figure S9). Changes
in residue orientations around the TTR mutation sites have been observed
with 1H NMR previously.56 Therefore,
with V30M and L55P mutations being more exposed to the bulk solvent,
the mutation-induced structural changes likely result in charge-carrying
site (Zavg) differences. Additionally, L55P is more solvent
exposed relative to V30M which could be why it exhibits the highest
Zavg. Conversely, F87A, V122I, and T119M are all located
at interfaces;58 thus, changes in residue
orientations are not likely to result in changes in charge sites and
the resulting Zavg (see Figure 5B).59

Note that these mutants (V30M and L55P) have significantly higher

Error bars represent the standard deviation of replicates with different
nESI emmitters (n = 3). For both (A) and (B), wt-
TTR data are the same.

(A) TIU heatmaps of wt-TTR
and TTR mutants (15+). There
are no changes in CCS across the temperature range, demonstrating
that TTR exhibits strong thermal stability in solution. (B) CIU heatmaps
of wt-TTR and TTR mutants (15+). wt- and mutant TTR all
unfold completely with the collisional activation provided; however,
the energy required and intermediate pathways vary for each proteoform.
Nuances in the CIU profiles are indicative of minor structural changes
induced by point mutations.

CIU analysis provides information about the relative enthalpic
stabilities of the TTR proteoforms. CIUSuite2 CIU50 analysis of the
CIU data shows V122I requires the highest energy to unfold the native
conformation (1367.7 eV) suggesting greater overall stabilities in
the gas phase compared to V30M, L55P, F87A and T119M (see Supporting Information Figures S6 and S7B). Also,
two typical intermediate states of CCS are observed in CIU experiments
(denoted as I1 and I2) at ∼4000 and ∼4500
Å2 respectively (see Figure 6B), indicating that the unfolding involves
reorganization of similar domains within the complex for all TTR proteoforms.40,51 Note that all TTR mutants have weaker intensity for these two intermediate
states, respectively, with CIU compared to the wt-TTR, reflecting
that these mutants have more unstable intermediate states and the
conformational changes from the compact form to the fully unfolded
form are more direct. Figure S4 shows the
presence of these intermediate states arise early in the unfolding
process of TTR mutants, but the relative abundances of the compact
and fully unfolded states are always higher than for the intermediate
states.

Although related in terms of physiological role/function,
V122I,
L55P, and V30M behave differently in CIU experiments. Figures 6B and S7B show that the compact form of V122I is retained at the
highest collision energy and unfolds at a CIU50 of 1367.7 eV, but
L55P and V30M dissociate at collision energies of 803.5 eV. L55P also
shows additional unfolding at 1875 eV with the presence of a more
extended conformer, indicating a difference in the unfolding pathway
between wild-type and mutants (Figures 6B and S4). CIU profiles
for T119M and F87A are most similar, with a CIU50 of 918.6 and 918.5
eV, respectively. The F87A mutant is known to be unstable in solution
compared to the other mutants which may be the reason this proteoform
unfolds at low energy; however, T119M is known to be more stable than
the other mutants and wt-TTR- in solution. The instability of T119M
in the gas phase suggests that water molecules are required to stabilize
the structure of the mutant. Because the water molecules are removed
in the gas phase, the stability of the T119M mutant decreases and
it unfolds at low energy. This hypothesis is supported by a previous
study that suggested the T119M mutation recruits more water molecules
to a C-terminal loop region relative to wt-TTR.53 Furthermore, this observation may also indicate that the
effect solvation has on structure and stability may be greatest for
T119M compared with all the TTR species analyzed in this study. Here
we show that CIU profiles can be utilized to probe the gas phase stability
of TTR mutants and may provide information on solution phase characteristics
of protein structure such as the role of hydration through comparison
with TIU and Zavg.

The Zavg shifts point
to conformational and stability
differences between wild type and mutant TTR; however, the extent
of unfolding induced by collisional activation is much greater than
the extent of unfolding observed by TIU. Wild type and mutant TTR
all exhibit CCSs of ∼3500 Å2 across all temperatures
(Figure 6A). A marginal
amount of unfolding induced by TIU can be seen for the unstable mutant
F87A at 60 °C; however, the tetramer dissociates past this temperature,
and no mobility can be captured (see Figures 6A and S3). The
thermal stabilities of the TTR tetramer complexes illustrate the importance
of water for this system. Banerjee et al. reported that the hydrogen
bond network of TTR is stabilized by eight water molecules that are
surrounding the protein,45 and Ferrão-Gonzales
et al.60 reported the importance of hydration
and pressure in stabilizing for TTR; however, water molecules are
not retained by the gas phase ions leading to understandable differences
in solution and gas phase stabilities.

### Stabilities of Metallothionein-2A

apo- and metalated (Cd2+, Ag+ and Cu+) MT-2A. The metalation of MT by Cd2+, Ag+ and
Cu+ exhibits a high degree of cooperative binding as shown
previously,37,38 and these spectra were taken
at points in the metal titration where product ion abundances were
at a maximum. Figure 2B contains Zavg plots for apo- and metalated product ions
as a function of nESI emitter solution temperature (5–70 °C).
The effect of temperature on Zavg for apo-MT is much larger
compared to that of the metalated MTs (Cd4-MT Ag4-MT and Cu6-MT). Moreover, the increase in Zavg with temperature provides evidence for changes in conformation or
SASA even upon metalation. The decrease in Zavg from 55–60
°C was only observed for apo-MT, which may be indicative of some
significant structural rearrangement at these higher temperatures
such as annealing. Deviation in Zavg for apo- and metalated-MTs
are indicative of differences in SASA and apo-MT having the highest
Zavg is likely due to the higher conformational entropy
of apo-MT. The various metalated-MTs exhibited very similar solution
thermal stability in the Zavg experiment. These data provide
evidence that metalation is most important to MT’s stability
rather than the composition of metals bound.

and metalated MT at selected temperatures;
5+ ions are labeled in red and 4+ ions are labeled
in blue. The asterisks (*) denote unreacted apo-MT and low-abundance
metalated products for the MT5+ ions (Cd7, Ag6, Cu4, and Cu10). (B) Average charge
states for apo- and partially metalated MT ions of the highest abundance
species in the spectra; error bars represent standard deviations of
replicates with the same nESI emitter (n = 3).

Figure 3 contains
plots for CCS vs thermal activation and collisional activation for
apo-MT5+ and metalated-MT5+ ions shown as CIU
plots, and the CCS profiles used to generate these plots are shown
in Figures S1 and S2. TIU data in Figure 3A show that apo-MT
has two distinct conformations across the entire temperature range,
which is not observed for any of the metalated-MT, underscoring the
important role of metal binding on the conformational entropy for
MT-metal product ions. This is consistent with the changes observed
for Zavg for all metalated MT discussed vide supra. The
fwhm of the TIU CCS profiles for Cu4-, Cu10-,
and Cd4-MT increase with temperature by approximately 7%,
30%, and 28%, respectively (Figure S1).
These trends are very different for Cu6- and Ag4-MT as their CCS profiles decrease in fwhm (decreased conformational
entropy), indicating that certain coordination numbers and metal types
yield different solution thermal stabilities. Moreover, the Cu4-MT and Cu10MT complex is annealed or adopts a
molten globule state that then forms more compact conformations, but
at temperatures above ∼60 °C low abundance extended conformers
are formed for Cu4-MT (see Figure 3A).57 This observation
suggests that these metal bound states can adopt numerous Cu+ coordinated configurations. We previously showed that Cu4-MT is formed by addition of 4 Cu+ ions to the α-domain
and Cu10-MT followed by addition of 6 Cu+ ions
to the β-domain.38 Evidently, the
dynamics of the metalated α- and β-domains are not coupled,
and the peak broadening at high temperatures is evidence for restructuring
of the complex at higher temperatures. Data for apo-MT4+ and metalated-MT4+ ions are shown in Figure S8; note that the thermal unfolding and collisional
activation of 4+ ions have negligible effects on the CCS.
The different TIU profiles for MT4+ and MT5+ are further evidence for solvent induced conformational differences.
Reason(s) for these differences are unknown; consequently, the following
discussion will be limited to the 5+ ions.

(A) TIU heat maps (5–70
°C) for 5+ apo-MT,
Cd4-MT, Ag4-MT, Cu4-MT, Cu6-MT, and Cu10-MT. CCS profiles used to generate the TIU
heat maps are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). (B) CIU heat maps for apo- and metalated MT with
raw 5+ CCS profiles used to generate data are shown in the Supporting
Information (see Figure S2). For each of
the metalated MTs CIU, there appears to be two main ion populations,
one family of conformers with CCS centered at ∼750 Å2 and a larger CCS that differs for each metal. These differences
are related to the cooperative metal coordination within the α-
and β-domains.37,38

The CIU heat maps in Figure 3B indicate that MT gas phase stability increases upon metalation.
Each metalation (number and metal type) differs in their final unfolded
CCS, which is dependent on the metal coordination within the α-
and β-domains.38,40 CIUSuite2 CIU50 values were extracted
to compare initial to final conformer transition energies (see Figures S5 and S7A).41 Cu10-MT shows the highest CIU50 value at 137.6 eV, compared
with apo-MT that is unfolded from the beginning (<25 eV) and all
other metalated-MT had a CIU50 of ∼62 eV. These data show there
is no significant reduction in unfolding with different metal coordination
(Cd2+, Ag+, and Cu+), but the presence
and stoichiometry of metal binding can increase MT’s gas phase
stability.

The MT data provide evidence that gas phase and solution
phase
techniques sample different unfolding pathways along the REL for protein
complexes. CIU data reveal that apo and metalated MT unfold readily
with minimal collision energy. This indicates that the structure of
the MT is unstable in the gas phase. Conversely, the TIU data reveal
that the protein does not unfold significantly at any of the temperatures
sampled; indirect evidence that water has stabilizing effects on the
complex. It is important to note, however, that the conformational
entropy does increase for certain MT-metal complexes (Cd4-, Cu4-, and Cu10-MT) with increased temperature
observed with TIU and all MT-metal complexes for Zavg measurements.
This indicates that differences in interaction with water molecules
alter the conformational entropy of the MT proteoforms. It is therefore
possible that stabilization of the MT structure in solution is due
to the surrounding water molecules that interact with the protein.
The phenomenon of water molecule stabilization has been shown for
many other protein–protein and protein–ligand systems.2,55 This suggests that entropic contributions by solvent play a part
in stabilizing the MT structure, preventing the unfolding of MT and
MT-metal complexes under destabilizing conditions (higher temperatures),
and revealing the importance of water for the stabilization of protein-metal
complexes that has not been studied in the current literature.

### Stabilities
of WT and Mutant TTR

The following experiments
are designed to better understand the structure(s), stability, and
dynamics of intact wt-TTR and TTR mutants. We and others have shown
that under certain experimental conditions (pH, ionic strength, and
temperature) wt-TTR and TTR mutants disassemble to form monomers and
dimers.39,51,53,55 The results in this work provide evidence for the
disassembly of TTR at various temperature values. At 80 °C, wt-
and mutant TTR complexes disassemble to form abundant monomers (Figure S10), while the F87A mutant completely
disassembles to monomers and dimers at temperatures of ∼65
°C (see Figure 4), and V122I has some low abundance of monomers throughout the temperature
range examined.

Mass spectra of wt- and mutant TTR at various temperatures
using
the vT-ESI device. Tetramers, monomers, dimers and the highest charge
state of the tetramers are labeled in the spectra. F87A and V122I
are the only mutants with significant amounts of monomer and/or dimer
present at any temperature. Note that F87A consists primarily of monomers
at 65 °C due to its low tetramer stability relative to the other
TTR mutants.

Zavg has been shown
previously to examine nuanced changes
in structure that may not be resolvable using IM-MS.19 The Zavg values for WT-TTR and TTR mutants change
significantly in the temperature range of 5 to 80 °C indicating
there is a change in SASA when the solution temperature is changed
(see Figures 5 and 6A). Notably, there is a slight increase in Zavg at the colder temperatures for all samples (<20 °C),
which we interpret as evidence of cold unfolding due to hydration
of the nonpolar regions pertinent to protein folding.3 V30M and L55P exhibit a higher Zavg relative
to wt-TTR (Figure 5A), which may be related to their location on the peripheral part
of the structure (see Figure S9). Changes
in residue orientations around the TTR mutation sites have been observed
with 1H NMR previously.56 Therefore,
with V30M and L55P mutations being more exposed to the bulk solvent,
the mutation-induced structural changes likely result in charge-carrying
site (Zavg) differences. Additionally, L55P is more solvent
exposed relative to V30M which could be why it exhibits the highest
Zavg. Conversely, F87A, V122I, and T119M are all located
at interfaces;58 thus, changes in residue
orientations are not likely to result in changes in charge sites and
the resulting Zavg (see Figure 5B).59

Note that these mutants (V30M and L55P) have significantly higher

Error bars represent the standard deviation of replicates with different
nESI emmitters (n = 3). For both (A) and (B), wt-
TTR data are the same.

(A) TIU heatmaps of wt-TTR
and TTR mutants (15+). There
are no changes in CCS across the temperature range, demonstrating
that TTR exhibits strong thermal stability in solution. (B) CIU heatmaps
of wt-TTR and TTR mutants (15+). wt- and mutant TTR all
unfold completely with the collisional activation provided; however,
the energy required and intermediate pathways vary for each proteoform.
Nuances in the CIU profiles are indicative of minor structural changes
induced by point mutations.

CIU analysis provides information about the relative enthalpic
stabilities of the TTR proteoforms. CIUSuite2 CIU50 analysis of the
CIU data shows V122I requires the highest energy to unfold the native
conformation (1367.7 eV) suggesting greater overall stabilities in
the gas phase compared to V30M, L55P, F87A and T119M (see Supporting Information Figures S6 and S7B). Also,
two typical intermediate states of CCS are observed in CIU experiments
(denoted as I1 and I2) at ∼4000 and ∼4500
Å2 respectively (see Figure 6B), indicating that the unfolding involves
reorganization of similar domains within the complex for all TTR proteoforms.40,51 Note that all TTR mutants have weaker intensity for these two intermediate
states, respectively, with CIU compared to the wt-TTR, reflecting
that these mutants have more unstable intermediate states and the
conformational changes from the compact form to the fully unfolded
form are more direct. Figure S4 shows the
presence of these intermediate states arise early in the unfolding
process of TTR mutants, but the relative abundances of the compact
and fully unfolded states are always higher than for the intermediate
states.

Although related in terms of physiological role/function,
V122I,
L55P, and V30M behave differently in CIU experiments. Figures 6B and S7B show that the compact form of V122I is retained at the
highest collision energy and unfolds at a CIU50 of 1367.7 eV, but
L55P and V30M dissociate at collision energies of 803.5 eV. L55P also
shows additional unfolding at 1875 eV with the presence of a more
extended conformer, indicating a difference in the unfolding pathway
between wild-type and mutants (Figures 6B and S4). CIU profiles
for T119M and F87A are most similar, with a CIU50 of 918.6 and 918.5
eV, respectively. The F87A mutant is known to be unstable in solution
compared to the other mutants which may be the reason this proteoform
unfolds at low energy; however, T119M is known to be more stable than
the other mutants and wt-TTR- in solution. The instability of T119M
in the gas phase suggests that water molecules are required to stabilize
the structure of the mutant. Because the water molecules are removed
in the gas phase, the stability of the T119M mutant decreases and
it unfolds at low energy. This hypothesis is supported by a previous
study that suggested the T119M mutation recruits more water molecules
to a C-terminal loop region relative to wt-TTR.53 Furthermore, this observation may also indicate that the
effect solvation has on structure and stability may be greatest for
T119M compared with all the TTR species analyzed in this study. Here
we show that CIU profiles can be utilized to probe the gas phase stability
of TTR mutants and may provide information on solution phase characteristics
of protein structure such as the role of hydration through comparison
with TIU and Zavg.

The Zavg shifts point
to conformational and stability
differences between wild type and mutant TTR; however, the extent
of unfolding induced by collisional activation is much greater than
the extent of unfolding observed by TIU. Wild type and mutant TTR
all exhibit CCSs of ∼3500 Å2 across all temperatures
(Figure 6A). A marginal
amount of unfolding induced by TIU can be seen for the unstable mutant
F87A at 60 °C; however, the tetramer dissociates past this temperature,
and no mobility can be captured (see Figures 6A and S3). The
thermal stabilities of the TTR tetramer complexes illustrate the importance
of water for this system. Banerjee et al. reported that the hydrogen
bond network of TTR is stabilized by eight water molecules that are
surrounding the protein,45 and Ferrão-Gonzales
et al.60 reported the importance of hydration
and pressure in stabilizing for TTR; however, water molecules are
not retained by the gas phase ions leading to understandable differences
in solution and gas phase stabilities.

### Conclusion

Here,
we compare gas phase and solution phase stabilities as well
as conformational preferences for two protein complexes using CIU
and TIU. CIU of gas phase MT and TTR proteoforms results in unfolding
of protein ions, while TIU of the same proteoforms does not induce
significant unfolding at temperatures between 5 and 80 °C. We
attribute the observed thermal stability of the proteoforms analyzed
in this study to known effects of hydration, as water molecules are
known to play important roles in the stabilization of TTR45 and metalated proteins.61 Although unfolding is not apparent in TIU experiments, changes in
Zavg for MT and TTR are. We attribute this effect to slight
rearrangement of protein complex structure due to alteration of the
hydration surrounding the complexes in solution. These small changes
in hydration induce changes in SASA but are too small to be detected
by ion mobility mass spectrometry. The kinetic-trapping of such conformational
shifts as a function of temperature (Figure 1) provides insight into the first question
proposed in this study on whether the structure, stability, and dynamics
of proteins can be monitored with nMS by providing evidence that nMS
can sample microstates within the REL.54 The ability to unfold the protein, only after sufficient gas phase
activation (CIU) provides evidence for Fred McLafferty’s second
question that nMS is retaining native states as we transition from
solution to gas phase.54,62 Future nMS studies should utilize
CIU and TIU complementarily and decide which technique would provide
the answer to their biological questions.

The results provide
further rationale for utilizing native mass
spectrometry for interrogating “native protein states”
vis-à-vis “native-like protein states”.7 While the significance of how these states differ
may be questioned, the role(s) for dynamic sampling of the protein
folding landscape (conformational entropy) has important implications
for structural biology. For example, water promotes hydrophobic interactions
and interactions with metals,63 which serve
to stabilize proteins, protein–ligand complexes, and their
interactions with other biomolecules.2 Stabilizing
water interactions may be why metal binding to MT decreases conformational
entropy as seen in our TIU, CIU, and Zavg data. Moreover,
the Zavg vs temperature plots for each of the three MT-metal
binding states are indistinguishable, indicating that the different
metal ions (Cd2+, Ag+, and Cu+) do
not have significant influence on the solution phase conformational
entropy relative to one another. Additionally, TTR is known to be
stabilized by water, thus removal of hydrating water is expected to
destabilize TTR, an effect that is observed when collisionally activating
proteins in the gas phase with CIU. Collectively, these data further
illustrate the stabilizing effects of water for protein complex structures
and suggest that solvent effects must be accounted for when making
inferences about protein structure.
