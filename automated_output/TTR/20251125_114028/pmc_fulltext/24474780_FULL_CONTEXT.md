## Proteolytic cleavage of Ser52Pro variant transthyretin triggers its amyloid fibrillogenesis

### Abstract

SignificanceTransthyretin, a normal circulating plasma protein, is inherently amyloidogenic. It forms abnormal, insoluble, extracellular amyloid fibrils in the elderly, sometimes causing structural and functional damage leading to disease, senile amyloidosis. More than 100 different point mutations in the transthyretin gene cause earlier adult-onset, autosomal-dominant, fatal, hereditary amyloidosis. The transthyretin variant Ser52Pro is responsible for the most aggressive known clinical phenotype. Here we identify the crucial pathogenic role of specific proteolytic cleavage at residue 48 in triggering fibril formation by this variant. Genuine amyloid fibril formation in vitro is much more extensive than previously reported for wild-type transthyretin or any other transthyretin variant. Characterization of the fibrillogenic effect of this cleavage powerfully informs drug design and targeting for transthyretin amyloidosis.
