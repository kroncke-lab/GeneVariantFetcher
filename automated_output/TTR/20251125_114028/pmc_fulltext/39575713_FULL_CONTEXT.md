## Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis in Patients Referred to a Genetic Testing Program

### Abstract

BackgroundDiagnosis of hereditary amyloid transthyretin (hATTR) amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is frequently delayed, in large part because of symptom overlap with other cardiovascular diseases and limited provider knowledge of this disease. The sponsored and provider referred hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program (Ionis, Carlsbad, CA; Ambry Genetics, Aliso Viejo, CA) provided no‐cost genetic testing to adults with a family history or clinical suspicion of hATTR amyloidosis. This study aims to characterize patients with hATTR amyloidosis and increase awareness of genetic testing for hATTR.Methods and ResultsPatients were referred to the hATTR genetic testing program, and a cross‐sectional post hoc analysis was performed. A pathogenic TTR variant was identified in 1503 (6.6%) of 22 886 patients referred for genetic testing between June 2018 and March 2022. Patients were identified in all US states, 3 US territories, and Canada. Median age at testing was 63 years, and 44% were female. The p.V142I TTR variant was the most common (n=1263, 84.0%). Only 32% of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant reported a known family history; a lower percentage of Black individuals reported a known family history compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Black patients accounted for 23.7% of all patients referred and 81.9% of patients with the p.V142I variant.ConclusionsThis sponsored genetic testing program identified a large number of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant, notably, in geographic regions not previously reported, and demographic groups that are historically underrepresented in the literature.

### What Is New?

In this analysis of ≥3 years of data from the hereditary amyloid transthyretin (hATTR) Compass Genetic Testing Program, approximately 7% of referred patients had a pathogenic transthyretin variant.The program identified 38 unique pathogenic transthyretin variants throughout the United States, US territories, and Canada, including in areas where no patients have been previously reported.Pathogenic transthyretin variants were found in a substantial proportion of referred Black patients and in patients without a known family history of amyloid transthyretin amyloidosis; women accounted for a large proportion of identified patients.

### What Are the Clinical Implications?

Increasing provider awareness and understanding of the known clinical and demographic profile of patients with amyloid transthyretin with cardiomyopathy can prompt early referral for genetic testing for diagnostic confirmation.Expanding provider knowledge on access and availability of sponsored genetic testing programs for hereditary amyloid transthyretin amyloidosis, and future analyses of data collected, may add to the overall knowledge and understanding of this genetic disease.

### METHODS

Variant classification data for alterations reported here are available in ClinVar, a public, open‐access repository by Ambry Genetics (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/submitters/61756/).

To minimize the possibility of unintentionally sharing information that can be used to re‐identify private information, individual participant data will not be shared. The hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program, a collaborative effort between Ionis (Carlsbad, CA) and Ambry Genetics (Aliso Viejo, CA), was created to aid in the diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis. This sponsored program provided no‐cost, confidential genetic testing to patients aged ≥18 years in the United States and Canada with a family history of hATTR amyloidosis with symptoms consistent with ATTR with polyneuropathy. Individuals <18 years of age may have qualified for cascade screening when they had a family member with a pathogenic TTR variant or symptoms consistent with hATTR amyloidosis. Program awareness was provided to health care providers throughout the United States and Canada through educational outreach programs delivered by clinically trained Genomic Science Liaisons employed by Ambry Genetics.

Four genetic tests were available through the program, and test selection was made by the health care provider: (1) a next‐generation sequencing cardiogenetics panel
25
 of 92 genes associated with inherited cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, and other CVDs; (2) an exome sequencing neuropathy panel
25
 of 81 genes associated with peripheral neuropathies; (3) a TTR single gene test, including sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis; and (4) a TTR site‐specific test to assess a single, known variant within families. Patient referral for genetic testing and genetic counseling required completion of a test requisition form (TRF) by a health care provider, which included patient self‐reporting demographic data of date of birth, sex (check boxes for male and female), race or ethnicity (check boxes for African American [reported in this analysis as Black], Asian, Caucasian [reported in this analysis as White], Hispanic [reported in this analysis as Latinx], Jewish, and “Other” with an area for free text), family history of hATTR amyloidosis, and clinical symptoms (check boxes for sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction; gastrointestinal symptoms; heart disease; renal issues; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; lumbar spinal stenosis; and unintentional weight loss). Additional data collected on the TRF included the organization and geographic location of the ordering physician and amyloid‐relevant laboratory, imaging, and biopsy results for the patient. Data on patients' self‐reported gender were not captured on the TRF. The number of hATTR amyloidosis cases identified per month and the number of referring providers per month were determined to evaluate for the potential of referral bias as pronounced variability in cases identified or referrals over time could suggest changes in the referred patient population. Identified genetic variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain clinical significance were reported to ordering clinicians following standard diagnostic testing practices. A post hoc analysis was performed on data collected from the hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program from June 15, 2018, to March 29, 2022.

This study was exempt from institutional review board approval under 45 CRF § 46.104(d)(4). Retrospective data analysis and reporting of deidentified data exempted the study from the requirement of receiving consent from patients. All individuals provided consent to be tested through the hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program through their ordering providers.

Data were primarily analyzed using descriptive statistics. Tests for normality assumptions for age at testing included the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and Jarque–Bera test (skewness and kurtosis). Statistical analyses of the age at testing were performed using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test and the Dunn's multiple comparisons tests for comparisons of 3 or more groups, or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test for comparisons of 2 groups. All tests had a significance level threshold of 0.05.

### RESULTS

During this ≥3‐year period, 3215 clinicians from 2254 organizations referred 22 886 patients for genetic testing. Providers specializing in cardiology (58.2%), including pediatric cardiology, cardiac surgery, and cardiovascular surgery, and neurology (35.1%), including neuromuscular medicine and neurosurgery, accounted for 93.3% of referring providers (Table 1; Table S1). Patient referrals were received from all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and 8 Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan) (Table S2).

Includes 3 patients who reported “suspected” family history.

Includes 1 patient referred for both cardiogenetics and neuropathy panels.

See Tables S7 and S8 for details on self‐reported race and ethnicity.

A total of 1503 (6.6%) patients had a pathogenic TTR variant. The cardiogenetics panel identified the greatest number of pathogenic TTR variants (n=703) (Table S4). Approximately 1.2 new hATTR amyloidosis cases were identified per day over the ≥3‐year period (Figure S2A and S2B). The monthly rate of patients identified as having a pathogenic TTR variant (Figure S2A) and the monthly number of referring providers (Figure S2C) both remained consistent over time. The cardiogenetics panel and neuropathy panel testing identified non‐TTR pathogenic variants in 1263 (6.7%) patients.

A total of 38 unique pathogenic variants of the TTR gene were identified; see Table S5 for a complete list of TTR variants identified in this study. The most frequently identified pathogenic TTR variants were p.V142I (1263 [84.0%]), p.T80A (75 [5.0%]), and p.V50M (62 [4.1%]) (Figure S1); all other pathogenic TTR variants accounted for the remaining 6.9% (Figure 1A). Patients positive for p.V142I, p.T80A, and p.V50M were identified by all 4 genetic tests and were spread across the United States and Canada (Figure S3). The pV.142I variant was identified most often with the cardiogenetics panel (646 [51.2%]) and the p.T80A (44 [58.7%]) and p.V50M (39 [62.9%]) variants were most often identified with the TTR single gene test (Table S4).

Het indicates heterozygous; Hom, homozygous; IQR, interquartile range; ns, not significant; TTR, transthyretin gene; and TTR+, patient with a pathogenic TTR variant.

Female patients accounted for 45% of all patients with a pathogenic TTR variant. The percentage of female patients with the p.V142I, p.T80A, and p.V50M variants were 45%, 52%, and 47%, respectively. Significant differences in age at testing in the overall population were seen for the three most common pathogenic TTR variants identified (Figure 1B). There were no significant differences between sexes in age at testing (Figure 1C).

Only 31.7% of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant reported a known family history. Patients with the p.V50M, p.T80A, or other pathogenic TTR variants were more likely (79.0%, 65.3%, and 63.1%, respectively) to have a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis than patients with the p.V142I variant (24.8%) (Table S6). The p.V142I variant had the lowest known family history rate despite being the most common variant in this study.

Patients with the p.V142I variant were predominantly Black (81.9%), whereas patients with the p.T80A or p.V50M variants were predominantly White (85.3% and 72.6%, respectively) (Figure 2A; Table S7). Of the patients with other pathogenic TTR variants, 14.6% were Black and 49.5% were White. Notably, among Black patients with any pathogenic TTR variant, 24.2% reported a family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 45.7% reported no family history, and 30.1% did not know or did not provide information on family history (Figure 2B). This contrasted with White patients, of whom 63.5% reported a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 23.4% reported no family history, and 13.0% did not know or did not provide information on family history.

TTR indicates transthyretin gene.

Of the 1263 patients with a p.V142I pathogenic TTR variant, 1209 (95.7%) were heterozygous for the variant and 54 (4.3%) were homozygous for the variant. The median (IQR) age at testing in all patients with the p.V142I variant was 71 (59–78) years (range: 16–99 years). The median (IQR) age at testing was significantly lower in patients homozygous for p.V142I (66 [62–70] years; range: 19–82 years) compared with patients heterozygous for p.V142I (72 [59–78] years; range: 16–99 years) (Figure 1B). There were no differences in age at testing between men and women for either the heterozygous or homozygous variant (Figure 1C).

Twenty‐nine unique TTR variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified in 59 patients; 55 patients were identified as having only TTR VUS, 4 patients had a pathogenic TTR variant in addition to the VUS (labeled secondary VUS) (Figure 3A). Slightly more than half (52.7%) of the VUS were identified by the cardiogenetics panel, 27.3% were identified by the neuropathy panel, and 20.0% were identified by the TTR single gene test. Among patients who had only a VUS (n=55), 20 (36.4%) were Black, 7 (12.7%) were other racial and ethnic groups, 20 (36.4%) were White, and 8 (14.5%) had no recorded information on race or ethnicity. Of these 55 patients identified as having only a TTR VUS, 6 (10.9%) had a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 25 (45.5%) had no family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 20 (36.4%) did not know about family history, and 4 (7.3%) provided no information on family history (Table S6). Notably, 5 VUS occurred in the same positions as substitutions classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (LP) but, at this time, have insufficient evidence to confer an LP classification (Figure 3B).

LP indicates likely pathogenic; P, pathogenic; TTR, transthyretin gene; and VUS, variants of uncertain significance.

An analysis of all referrals (N=22 886) by race or ethnicity identified differences within racial and ethnic groups between types of pathogenic variants. Notably, a pathogenic TTR variant was detected in 19.4% of referred Black patients, whereas only 4.3% had a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 4; Table S8). This contrasted with referred patients who were Asian, Latinx, or White, in whom a lower percentage had a pathogenic TTR variant (1.6%–4.5%) and a higher percentage had a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (6.0%–8.7%).

Of the 10 845 patients tested with the cardiogenetics panel, 1707 (15.7%) had a diagnostic pathogenic variant in any gene (including TTR) and 117 (1.1%) had pathogenic variants consistent with carrier status for a recessive condition (Figure 5A). Pathogenic variants in only non‐TTR genes were identified in 1004 (9.3%) patients. The 5 most frequently identified cardiomyopathy‐related pathogenic non‐TTR variants were TTN (n=339), MYBPC3 (n=237), MYH7 (n=110), DMD (n=43), and DSP (n=42) (Figure 5B). Patients with a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5C) or with a pathogenic TTR variant and a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5D) were generally tested at a significantly younger age compared with patients with only a TTR variant. Patients with a pathogenic TTR variant (Figure 5E) or a pathogenic TTR and one pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5F) were predominantly Black compared with patients with 1 or more pathogenic non‐TTR variants, who were predominantly White.

Of the 8109 patients tested with the neuropathy panel testing, 346 (4.3%) had a diagnostic pathogenic variant in any gene (including TTR) (Data S1; Figure S4). The most common pathogenic variant identified was PMP22; pathogenic variants in the TTR gene were the second most common. Patients identified with a pathogenic PMP22 variant were tested at a significantly younger age compared with patients with a pathogenic TTR variant and predominantly self‐identified as White (62.9%).

TTR
 Variants

Female patients accounted for 45% of all patients with a pathogenic TTR variant. The percentage of female patients with the p.V142I, p.T80A, and p.V50M variants were 45%, 52%, and 47%, respectively. Significant differences in age at testing in the overall population were seen for the three most common pathogenic TTR variants identified (Figure 1B). There were no significant differences between sexes in age at testing (Figure 1C).

### Reported Family History and Race or Ethnicity of Patients With Pathogenic 
TTR
 Variants

Only 31.7% of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant reported a known family history. Patients with the p.V50M, p.T80A, or other pathogenic TTR variants were more likely (79.0%, 65.3%, and 63.1%, respectively) to have a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis than patients with the p.V142I variant (24.8%) (Table S6). The p.V142I variant had the lowest known family history rate despite being the most common variant in this study.

Patients with the p.V142I variant were predominantly Black (81.9%), whereas patients with the p.T80A or p.V50M variants were predominantly White (85.3% and 72.6%, respectively) (Figure 2A; Table S7). Of the patients with other pathogenic TTR variants, 14.6% were Black and 49.5% were White. Notably, among Black patients with any pathogenic TTR variant, 24.2% reported a family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 45.7% reported no family history, and 30.1% did not know or did not provide information on family history (Figure 2B). This contrasted with White patients, of whom 63.5% reported a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 23.4% reported no family history, and 13.0% did not know or did not provide information on family history.

Of the 1263 patients with a p.V142I pathogenic TTR variant, 1209 (95.7%) were heterozygous for the variant and 54 (4.3%) were homozygous for the variant. The median (IQR) age at testing in all patients with the p.V142I variant was 71 (59–78) years (range: 16–99 years). The median (IQR) age at testing was significantly lower in patients homozygous for p.V142I (66 [62–70] years; range: 19–82 years) compared with patients heterozygous for p.V142I (72 [59–78] years; range: 16–99 years) (Figure 1B). There were no differences in age at testing between men and women for either the heterozygous or homozygous variant (Figure 1C).

### Variants of Uncertain Significance

Twenty‐nine unique TTR variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified in 59 patients; 55 patients were identified as having only TTR VUS, 4 patients had a pathogenic TTR variant in addition to the VUS (labeled secondary VUS) (Figure 3A). Slightly more than half (52.7%) of the VUS were identified by the cardiogenetics panel, 27.3% were identified by the neuropathy panel, and 20.0% were identified by the TTR single gene test. Among patients who had only a VUS (n=55), 20 (36.4%) were Black, 7 (12.7%) were other racial and ethnic groups, 20 (36.4%) were White, and 8 (14.5%) had no recorded information on race or ethnicity. Of these 55 patients identified as having only a TTR VUS, 6 (10.9%) had a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 25 (45.5%) had no family history of hATTR amyloidosis, 20 (36.4%) did not know about family history, and 4 (7.3%) provided no information on family history (Table S6). Notably, 5 VUS occurred in the same positions as substitutions classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (LP) but, at this time, have insufficient evidence to confer an LP classification (Figure 3B).

### Comparison of Patients Positive for 
TTR
 or Other Genes by Self‐Reported Race or Ethnicity

An analysis of all referrals (N=22 886) by race or ethnicity identified differences within racial and ethnic groups between types of pathogenic variants. Notably, a pathogenic TTR variant was detected in 19.4% of referred Black patients, whereas only 4.3% had a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 4; Table S8). This contrasted with referred patients who were Asian, Latinx, or White, in whom a lower percentage had a pathogenic TTR variant (1.6%–4.5%) and a higher percentage had a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (6.0%–8.7%).

### Genetic Variants Identified With the Cardiogenetics Panel Testing

Of the 10 845 patients tested with the cardiogenetics panel, 1707 (15.7%) had a diagnostic pathogenic variant in any gene (including TTR) and 117 (1.1%) had pathogenic variants consistent with carrier status for a recessive condition (Figure 5A). Pathogenic variants in only non‐TTR genes were identified in 1004 (9.3%) patients. The 5 most frequently identified cardiomyopathy‐related pathogenic non‐TTR variants were TTN (n=339), MYBPC3 (n=237), MYH7 (n=110), DMD (n=43), and DSP (n=42) (Figure 5B). Patients with a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5C) or with a pathogenic TTR variant and a pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5D) were generally tested at a significantly younger age compared with patients with only a TTR variant. Patients with a pathogenic TTR variant (Figure 5E) or a pathogenic TTR and one pathogenic non‐TTR variant (Figure 5F) were predominantly Black compared with patients with 1 or more pathogenic non‐TTR variants, who were predominantly White.

### Neuropathy Panel Testing

Of the 8109 patients tested with the neuropathy panel testing, 346 (4.3%) had a diagnostic pathogenic variant in any gene (including TTR) (Data S1; Figure S4). The most common pathogenic variant identified was PMP22; pathogenic variants in the TTR gene were the second most common. Patients identified with a pathogenic PMP22 variant were tested at a significantly younger age compared with patients with a pathogenic TTR variant and predominantly self‐identified as White (62.9%).

### DISCUSSION

This study of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant identified through the hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program adds to the growing body of literature characterizing the demographic and clinical profile of patients with hATTR amyloidosis. The program identified 38 unique pathogenic TTR variants in 1503 (6.6%) of the 22 886 referred patients. Patients with a pathogenic TTR variant were identified throughout the United States, US territories, and Canada, including in areas where no patients have been previously reported.
24
 A pathogenic TTR variant was identified in 19.4% of Black patients referred to the program. Compared with prior reports of patients with a pathogenic TTR variant, a lower percentage of identified patients reported a known family history of ATTR amyloidosis (32% versus 48%),
26
 and women constituted a greater percentage of identified patients (44% versus 23%).
24

Referrals to the genetic testing program in this study were received from all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and all Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. The geographic location of referred patients and pathogenic TTR variants identified from a contemporary genetic testing program for ATTR amyloidosis (Alnylam Act, a collaborative effort between Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA and Invitae, San Francisco, CA) that has a similar geographic reach (United States and Canada) and criteria for patient referral (patients aged ≥18 years who have a family history or are suspected of having a diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis) have not been reported.
27
 Only 1 retrospective review of 252 patients diagnosed with ATTR over a 40‐year period reported the number of pathogenic TTR variants identified by US state.
24
 The referrals to the genetic testing program in this study identified pathogenic TTR variants in 8 states in which no pathogenic TTR variants were identified in the former study (Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Utah).
24

Black patients are underdiagnosed with CVD, despite having a greater burden of heart failure and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors compared with the general population.
28
 The burden of CVD is amplified for Black women, who have a higher mortality rate due to CVD compared with the general population.
29
 This disparity in care is further magnified for patients with ATTR amyloidosis, which disproportionally affects the Black population.
30
 The most prevalent pathogenic TTR variant reported in the United States (85.0%),
22
 in this study (84.0%), and in a similar contemporary program (71.5%),
27
 is the p.V142I variant, which predominately presents with the cardiomyopathy phenotype
1
, 
4
, 
23
 resulting in an age‐dependent, late‐onset, restrictive/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with symptoms that mimic other common forms of heart failure.
31
 ATTR‐CM secondary to the p.V142I pathogenic TTR variant primarily affects Black individuals,
22
, 
32
, 
33
, 
34
 a patient population that is underrepresented in observational studies and clinical trials and has historically lower rates of diagnostic evaluation and genetic testing in clinical practice.

 Black patients constituted only 2% to 5% of the study population included in clinical trials of TTR‐targeted treatments for ATTR amyloidosis.

, 
41
, 
42
 Only 1 study of a TTR‐targeted treatment reported the percentage of enrolled patients who were of Hispanic ethnicity (27/168 [16.1%]).
42
 Barriers to genetic testing of Black individuals in clinical practice include lack of knowledge about genetic testing, type of health insurance coverage, access to care and testing, and racial inequalities in health care.

This study is unique in that a high proportion of patients identified with pathogenic TTR variants self‐identified as Black (1051/1503 [69.9%]) or of Latinx ethnicity (41/1503 [2.7%]). In this study and a similar contemporary program, Black patients accounted for the majority of patients with the p.V142I variant (81.9% versus 79.7%), the most common pathogenic TTR variant identified in both studies.
27
 These rates are much higher than the rate previously reported (25.0%) from autopsy assessments of cardiac tissue obtained from Black individuals with ATTR‐CM.
43
 The high proportion of Black patients identified in this study and that of a similar contemporary program
27
 supports that increasing provider and patient awareness of the availability of no‐cost, sponsored genetic testing programs for ATTR amyloidosis removes known barriers to genetic testing and facilitates accurate diagnosis in this patient population, who is at greatest risk for having the p.V142I pathogenic TTR variant.

The data for Latinx patients identified with a pathogenic TTR variant (n=41) in this study also add to the small but growing body of evidence in Latinx patients with hATTR amyloidosis. An analysis of biobank registry data between 2007 and 2015 in New York City reported that 1.3% (114/9006) of patients of Hispanic ethnicity were carriers of the p.V142I variant.
46
 A subsequent analysis of this biobank registry, performed between November 2019 and November 2020, found that 47% (15/32) of patients with a p.V142I variant identified as Hispanic/Latinx.
44
 In an observational study of 52 patients with hATTR‐CM in South Florida,
47
 13 (25%) self‐reported being of Hispanic ethnicity, of whom 9 (69%) had the p.V142I variant.

Patient report of no family history or an unknown family history of hATTR amyloidosis should also not prevent a provider from referring patients for genetic testing as the patient may lack awareness of the disease, disease penetrance can be variable, and family history may be absent or unknown.
26
, 
48
 Zampino et al.
34
 reported only 10% of patients with the p.V142I variant evaluated and treated over a 12‐year period reported a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis compared with 17% of patients with a p.V50M variant, and 69% of patients with a p.L78H variant. Increased access to genetic testing in patient populations with no prior knowledge of family history or potential genomic risk has been shown to have a significant positive impact on management of ATTR amyloidosis through increased follow‐up with specialty providers, having additional diagnostic tests performed, identification of additional ATTR amyloidosis related symptoms, and treatment initiation.
44
, 
48
 Patient and provider awareness of access to sponsored, no‐cost genetic testing programs for ATTR amyloidosis may be assisting in increasing awareness of a family history for Black patients as results from a similar genetic testing program published in 2021 reported 13.9% of Black patients reported a known family history for a pathogenic TTR variant.
27
 The proportion of Black patients who reported a known family history for a pathogenic TTR variant in this study was 24.2%.

Certain genetic profiles were associated with earlier age of referral for genetic testing. Although the median age of patients with the p.V142I variant in this study (71 years) was consistent with prior reports,
16
, 
22
, 
24
, 
33
 patients who were homozygous for the p.V142I variant or who had the p.T80A or p.V50M variant were referred for testing at a significantly younger age than patients who were heterozygous for the p.V142I variant. The significantly younger age at testing of patients homozygous for the p.V142I variant compared with patients heterozygous for the p.V142I variant is consistent with other reports
49
 and may be related to greater disease severity in those who are homozygous.
20
 Patients of younger age may also be identified through cascade screening as children of homozygous parents are obligate carriers of the pathogenic variant.
50
 No significant differences in age at testing by sex were noted between TTR variants. Patients with a pathogenic TTR variant plus a pathogenic non‐TTR cardiomyopathy‐related variant identified through panel testing in this study were referred for testing at a younger age than those having only a pathogenic TTR variant, suggesting that genetic variants in multiple cardiomyopathy‐related genes may hasten the disease or worsen the symptoms, leading to earlier diagnosis. Panel testing is recommended over TTR single gene testing due to the high number of non‐TTR pathogenic variants identified in this study and the ability for panel testing to identify if more than 1 pathogenic variant is present, particularly in patients who present at a younger age and with more severe disease.

Additionally, a greater percentage of female patients with the p.V142I variant was identified compared with prior reports (44% versus <28%).
22
, 
26
, 
34
, 
51
 The increase in the reported rate of the p.V142I variant in female patients is an evolving topic. The reason for male predominance of the p.V142I variant in prior reports is not well understood. A female predominance has been observed among asymptomatic patients.
52
 Female patients may be less likely to be identified because of a later age at symptom onset, milder phenotype, lower disease penetrance, or less aggressive disease trajectory.
16
, 
52
, 
53
, 
54
 Batra et al reported an increase in the percentage of women with the p.V142I variant from 0% in 2001 to 50% in 2018.
53
 In the THAOS (Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey) study update,
54
 41% of patients enrolled from inception (2007) through January 2020 were female, which is similar to the 45% of female patients identified in this study. Postmenopausal Black female carriers of the p.V142 variant have also been reported to have an increased risk for overall CVD event, acute heart rate, coronary heart disease, CVD death, and all‐cause mortality compared with noncarriers.

Genetic testing can also aid in identification of patients with TTR variants classified as VUS that have the potential to be pathogenic.
25
 Identification of VUS also allows for close patient monitoring and notification if these variants are subsequently reclassified as LP or pathogenic. This data set has already aided in the reclassification of 3 prior VUS as LP (c.194C>T [p.A65V], c.172G>C [p.D58H], and c.239C>T [p.T80I]).
25
 Patients with genetic testing results positive for a VUS, LP, or pathogenic variant should receive genetic counseling for education on the clinical relevance of their identified variant and their management options. Lastly, the true prevalence and penetrance of TTR variants is unknown, and genetic testing could assist in determining demographics and other clinical factors associated with penetrance.
16
, 
33

The worldwide prevalence of ATTR‐CM is unknown and ATTR‐CM is believed to be underdiagnosed.
1
 The recommendation is that genetic testing be performed for patients with cardiomyopathy or polyneuropathy of unclear cause or once a diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis has been made based on patient presentation, imaging, or biopsy results to differentiate between hATTR and wild‐type ATTR amyloidosis.

58
 However, limitations in the diagnostic capabilities of these modalities are known.
5
 Prevalence estimates for patients with suspected cardiac amyloidosis vary based on the screening modalities performed, ranging from 17.4% to 57.6% with bone scintigraphy alone, 46.7% with biopsy alone, and 32.9% to 71.0% in patients assessed with echocardiogram and biopsy with or without additional diagnostic cardiac imaging (cardiac magnetic resonance or bone scintography).
59
 As patient and provider awareness of ATTR amyloidosis increases, in part due to increased access and awareness of imaging modalities and biopsy for diagnosis, and more TTR‐targeting therapies become available, providers are beginning to consider earlier referral for genetic testing for diagnosis confirmation.
32
, 
60
, 
61
, 
62
 The results of this study provide evidence to further support findings of prior studies reporting that early and accurate diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis through genetic testing, irrespective of age at the time of testing,
45
 can lead to prompt initiation of disease‐modifying treatments and increased use of cascade screening and implementation of monitoring strategies for family members identified as carriers.

There are several limitations of this study that affect the extent to which the results can be generalized. First, the used data were unadjudicated, self‐reported patient demographic data collected from the TRF and lacked longitudinal, confirmatory diagnosis, or outcomes data. The TRF used for data collection in this study was developed to confirm eligibility of patient referral and not as a comprehensive data collection tool. As such, there are constraints on the data collected, such as lack of a comprehensive list of race and ethnicity options for patient self‐reporting and the potential for inadequate capture of all hATTR amyloidosis‐related symptoms as referral for genetic testing required a minimum reporting of only 2 symptoms. The results of patient self‐reported hATTR amyloidosis symptoms were not included in this study because of this potential for underreporting of hATTR amyloidosis related symptomology. The self‐reported nature and lack of adjudication of the data from this program is similar to a contemporary program.
27
 Due to the voluntary nature of the data collection and the need for a concise intake form, descriptive statistics were necessary for most analyses. Analysis was performed for comparison between groups when possible, such as assessing difference in age at testing between genetic variants. Second, the study is likely affected by referral bias as the study population is enriched with patients referred by providers who were familiar with ATTR amyloidosis and aware of the hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program.
30
 Patients may also have been referred to local genetic testing facilities or another contemporary sponsored, no‐cost genetic testing program.

### CONCLUSIONS

In this cross‐sectional, post hoc analysis of ≥3 years of data from the hATTR Compass Genetic Testing Program, approximately 7% of referred patients had a pathogenic TTR variant. Patients with a pathogenic TTR variant were identified in geographic areas in which TTR variants have not previously been reported, in a large number of Black patients, in patients of Latinx ethnicity, in individuals with no known family history of ATTR amyloidosis, and in nearly equal numbers of female patients—these are all patient populations that are underrepresented in the existing literature. These findings suggest that providers should have an increased index of suspicion for ATTR‐CM in Black male and female patients ≥60 years of age, with appropriate cardiac symptoms, with or without a known family history of hATTR amyloidosis. Expanded access and early referral for genetic testing represents a significant opportunity to better identify hATTR amyloidosis in patient groups historically underrepresented in observational and clinical studies.
