## Stratifying Disease Progression in Patients With Cardiac ATTR Amyloidosis

### Abstract

BackgroundTransthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is a progressive cardiomyopathy. The clinical course varies among individuals and there are no established measures to assess disease progression.ObjectivesThe goal of this study was to assess the prognostic importance of an increase in N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and outpatient diuretic intensification (ODI) as markers of disease progression in a large cohort of patients with ATTR-CA.MethodsWe evaluated landmark survival analysis based on worsening of NT-proBNP and requirement for ODI between time of diagnosis and a 1-year visit, and subsequent mortality in 2,275 patients with ATTR-CA from 7 specialist centers. The variables were developed in the National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) cohort (n = 1,598) and validated in the external cohort from the remaining centers (n = 677).ResultsBetween baseline and 1-year visits, 551 (34.5%) NAC patients and 204 (30.1%) patients in the external validation cohort experienced NT-proBNP progression (NT-proBNP increase >700 ng/L and >30%), which was associated with mortality (NAC cohort: HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.57-2.10; P < 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.32-2.33; P < 0.001). At 1 year, 451 (28.2%) NAC patients and 301 (44.5%) patients in the external validation cohort experienced ODI, which was associated with mortality (NAC cohort: HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.62-2.18; P < 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.53-2.74; P < 0.001). When compared with patients with a stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose, a higher risk of mortality was observed in those experiencing either NT-proBNP progression or ODI (NAC cohort: HR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.65-2.27; P < 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.36-2.77; P < 0.001), and those experiencing both NT-proBNP progression and ODI (NAC cohort: HR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.42-3.67; P < 0.001; validation cohort: HR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.17-4.79; P < 0.001).ConclusionsNT-proBNP progression and ODI are frequent and consistently associated with an increased risk of mortality. Combining both variables produces a simple, universally applicable model that detects disease progression in ATTR-CA.

### Methods

This is a retrospective multinational longitudinal study of patients diagnosed with ATTR-CA between 2005 and 2022 from 7 specialist referral centers: National Amyloidosis Centre (UK), Portland, Oregon (USA), Vienna (Austria), and 4 Italian centers (Bologna, Florence, Padua, and Pisa). Patients who underwent a comprehensive assessment at the time of diagnosis, and at 1-year of follow-up were eligible for inclusion. The diagnosis of ATTR-CA was established on the basis of validated diagnostic criteria.10 All patients underwent genetic sequencing of the TTR-gene. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and informed consent was obtained under the institutional review board policies of the relevant hospital administrations.

At the time of diagnosis and the subsequent 1-year follow-up assessment, the dose of oral loop diuretic was standardized to furosemide equivalents.14 ODI was defined as any postdiagnosis initiation or increment in the dose of loop diuretic (furosemide equivalent).11,12

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (2021 Stata Statistical Software: Release 17, StataCorp LLC). All continuous variables were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and presented as mean ± SD if the distribution was normal or median (Q1-Q3) otherwise. The independent samples Student’s t-test was used to compare means if the data were normally distributed in each group, or its nonparametric equivalent (Mann-Whitney U test) was used to compare the distributions of the 2 groups. Categorical data are presented as absolute numbers (n) and frequencies (%) and compared using the chi-square test.

To investigate and validate whether an increase in NT-proBNP and ODI at 1 year were associated with disease progression, the population was separated into a development cohort, comprising the patients from the National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC), and a validation cohort, comprising patients from the remaining centers. The optimal cutpoint for the absolute change in NT-proBNP and percentage change in NT-proBNP at 1 year were established using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves in the development cohort. The optimal cutpoint determined by the Youden method for an absolute change was 735 ng/L (sensitivity: 46.4%, specificity: 73.7%), and percentage change was 28.7% (sensitivity: 46.9%, specificity: 61.4%). Cutpoints of an absolute increase >700 ng/L (sensitivity: 47.2%, specificity: 72.5%), and relative percentage increase >30.0% (sensitivity: 46.3%, specificity: 61.9%) were both good discriminators of survival by the log-rank test. Based on the biological variability of NT-proBNP, progression of NT-proBNP was defined as an increase that was both >700 ng/L and >30.0%.15

Landmark survival analysis was carried out by assessing the relationship between initiation or intensification of oral diuretic (ODI) or worsening of NT-proBNP at the 1-year follow-up time point, with all-cause mortality from the 1-year follow-up timepoint onward. Mortality data were obtained via national databases. Survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, providing estimated HRs with 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was checked and confirmed using weighted Schoenfeld residuals. The association between the variables (NT-proBNP progression and ODI) and mortality was first evaluated in the NAC cohort, and then corroborated using the validation cohort, composed of patients from the remaining centers. Significant results were followed by internal validation. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was repeated in the whole study population, and internal validation of the model was achieved by performing a bootstrapping procedure with 500 repeats, affording a comparison of the percentile and bias-corrected methods to ensure the results were unbiased.

A second landmark analysis comprised patients prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials, who underwent assessment at the start date, and follow-up assessment at 1 year. This assessed the relationship between ODI or NT-proBNP worsening at the 1-year follow-up time point, with all-cause mortality from the 1-year follow-up time point onward.

The likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate the contribution of adding ODI to NT-proBNP progression. Harrell’s c-statistic was calculated to measure the discriminatory ability of ODI and NT-proBNP progression. The c-statistics were compared by randomly dividing the data set into 2 cohorts (1:1). The models were fitted to the first cohort, and the c-statistics compared in the second cohort using a Student’s t-test after creating Jackknife standard errors. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to view survival in different groups from the 1-year time point. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

At 1-year post diagnosis, 551 (34.5%) of NAC patients and 204 (30.1%) of patients in the external validation cohort experienced NT-proBNP progression. In patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression, the median NT-proBNP increased from 2,613 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 1,463-4,604 ng/L) to 4,860 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 3,112-8,822 ng/L). Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression were older, and had a higher prevalence of p.(V142I) hATTR-CA. Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a greater left ventricular wall thickness and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than those who did not. Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression were more commonly prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers and loop diuretics than those who did not (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of Patients Who Experienced NT-proBNP Progression With Those Who Did NotNAC CohortExternal Validation CohortStable NT-proBNP (n = 1,047, 65.5%)NT-proBNP Progression (n = 551, 33.5%)P ValueStable NT-proBNP (n = 473, 69.9%)NT-proBNP Progression (n = 204, 30.1%)P ValueAge, y75.2 ± 8.676.6 ± 7.30.00477.8 ± 7.779.8 ± 6.60.002Male900 (86.0)480 (87.1)0.523411 (86.9)176 (86.3)0.828Genotype<0.0010.433 Wild type737 (70.4)373 (67.7)422 (89.2)186 (91.2) p.(V142I)138 (13.2)a114 (20.7)6 (1.3)4 (2.0) Non-p.(V142I)172 (16.4)a64 (11.6)45 (9.5)14 (6.9)AF/AFL522 (49.9)254 (46.1)0.153256 (54.1)118 (57.8)0.372IHD191 (18.2)96 (17.4)0.685100 (21.1)47 (23.0)0.584Diabetes mellitus135 (12.9)99 (18.0)0.00689 (18.8)33 (16.2)0.412Stroke/TIA97 (9.3)53 (9.6)0.81741 (8.7)17 (8.3)0.886CKD stage 3-5438 (41.8)297 (53.9)<0.001240 (50.7)117 (57.4)0.114Cardiac devices PPM118 (11.3)75 (13.6)0.17270 (14.8)31 (15.2)0.894 ICD26 (2.5)11 (2.0)0.53812 (2.5)10 (4.9)0.111 CRT-D15 (1.4)4 (0.7)0.2156 (1.3)5 (2.5)0.264 CRT-P18 (1.7)11 (2.0)0.6934 (0.8)2 (1.0)0.864Heart failure severity NYHA functional class0.0220.350 I160 (15.3)a61 (11.1)104 (22.0)38 (18.6) II623 (59.5)a361 (65.5)263 (55.6)113 (55.4) III204 (19.5)107 (19.4)104 (22.0)50 (24.5) IV16 (1.5)3 (0.5)2 (0.4)3 (1.5) Missing441900 NAC stage0.0070.460 1597 (57.0)a270 (49.0)268 (56.7)105 (51.5) 2331 (31.6)200 (36.3)132 (27.9)64 (31.4) 3119 (11.4)81 (14.7)73 (15.4)35 (17.2) NT-proBNP, ng/L2,291 (1,150-4,482)2,732 (1,612-4,717)<0.0011,984 (854-4,489)2,365 (1,090-4,238)0.153 eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m264 (52-79)58 (47-72)<0.00159 (47-74)56 (43-71)0.039Echocardiographic parameters IVSd, mm16.6 ± 2.517.0 ± 2.30.00916.6 ± 3.618.2 ± 3.30.021 PWTd, mm16.2 ± 2.716.6 ± 2.40.01114.7 ± 5.615.3 ± 3.30.001 LVEF, %49.0 ± 10.748.3 ± 10.10.16352.7 ± 10.651.9 ± 10.00.275Medications Beta-blockers551 (52.6)317 (57.5)0.061270 (57.1)119 (58.3)0.763 ACEI/ARBs575 (54.9)342 (62.1)0.006244 (51.6)129 (63.2)0.005 ARNI12 (1.2)1 (0.2)0.03112 (2.5)4 (2.0)0.651 MRAs418 (39.9)232 (42.1)0.399143 (30.2)82 (40.2)0.012 SGT2i19 (1.8)10 (1.8)0.9998 (1.7)4 (2.0)0.807 Loop diuretic701 (67.0)417 (75.7)<0.001304 (64.3)158 (77.5)<0.001 Thiazide diuretic36 (3.4)31 (5.6)0.03829 (6.1)14 (6.9)0.720Values are mean ± SD, n (%), n, or median (Q1-Q3).Abbreviations as in Table 1.aP values for pairwise comparison <0.05.

In the NAC cohort, patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (25.0 deaths per 100 person-years [py]; 95% CI: 22.4-27.8 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (14.0 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 12.8-15.4 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.57-2.10; P < 0.001). The increased risk of mortality associated with NT-proBNP progression was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.40-2.00; P < 0.001), p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.27-2.32; P < 0.001), and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.52-3.57; P < 0.001).

In the external validation cohort, patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (18.4 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 14.8-22.9 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (10.6 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 8.8-12.8 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.32-2.33; P < 0.001) (Figure 1).Figure 1NT-proBNP Progression and SurvivalLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) progression at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between NT-proBNP progression and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.59-2.05; P < 0.001) and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between NT-proBNP progression and mortality. NT-proBNP progression was associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with NAC stage 1 disease (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.90-2.89; P < 0.001) and NAC stage 2 disease (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.24-1.86; P < 0.001), but not in those with NAC stage 3 disease (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.97-1.72; P = 0.08); however, assessment in this subgroup was limited by the small sample size. Nevertheless, the 95% CI contains values that suggest NT-proBNP progression could be associated with an increased risk of mortality. NT-proBNP progression was also associated with an increased risk of mortality in a subgroup of obese patients and in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation (Supplemental Material).

When compared with the NT-proBNP cutoffs recommended in the consensus document, the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression demonstrated improved discrimination in the external validation cohort (Harrell’s c-statistic: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.48-0.59 vs 0.56; 95% CI: 0.50-0.61; P = 0.033). Comparison between the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression and both NT-proBNP cutoffs recommended in the consensus document and cutoffs previously used in patients with wtATTR-CA, demonstrated that the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression produced the most consistent HRs across different genotypes, and across the NAC cohort and the external validation cohort (Supplemental Table 1).

In the whole study population, 515 patients were prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials; and had assessments at the start date, and 1 year after the start date (Supplemental Figure 1). In this subgroup, 131 (25.4%) patients experienced NT-proBNP progression, and patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (17.5 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 12.5-24.5 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (5.7 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 4.1-8.0 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 3.0-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.87-4.87; P < 0.001) (Figure 2A).Figure 2Disease Progression in Clinical Trials and Disease-Modifying TherapyLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between (A) N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) progression and (B) outpatient diuretic intensification (ODI) at 1 year, and subsequent survival in patients enrolled into clinical trials or prescribed disease-modifying therapy.

At 1 year, 451 (28.2%) NAC patients and 301 (44.5%) patients in the external validation cohort experienced ODI. Patients who experienced ODI were older and had a higher prevalence of p.(V142I) hATTR-CA and atrial fibrillation compared with those who did not experience ODI. Patients who experienced ODI had a worse functional capacity as evidenced by NYHA functional class and more severe cardiac phenotype evidenced by a higher median NT-proBNP, and greater wall thickness than those who did not. Among patients receiving loop diuretics the median furosemide dose at baseline was similar between the patients who experienced ODI and those who did not in both the NAC cohort (40 mg [40-80 mg]), and the external validation cohort (40 mg [25-75 mg]) (Table 3).Table 3Comparison of Patients Who Experienced Outpatient Diuretic Intensification to Those Who Did NotNAC CohortExternal Validation CohortNo ODI (n = 1,147, 71.8%)ODI (n = 451, 28.2%)P ValueNo ODI (n = 376, 55.5%)ODI (n = 301, 44.5%)P ValueAge, y75.2 ± 8.576.9 ± 7.1<0.00177.6 ± 7.979.4 ± 6.70.003Male979 (85.4)401 (88.9)0.062328 (87.2)259 (86.0)0.651Genotype<0.0010.252 Wild type785 (68.4)325 (72.1)341 (90.7)267 (88.7) p.(V142I)168 (14.6)a84 (18.6)3 (0.8)7 (2.3) Non-p.(V142I)194 (16.9)a42 (9.3)32 (8.5)27 (9.0)AF/AFL539 (47.0)237 (52.5)0.045190 (50.5)184 (61.1)0.006IHD192 (16.7)95 (21.1)0.04377 (20.5)70 (23.3)0.078Diabetes mellitus157 (13.7)77 (17.1)0.08559 (15.7)63 (20.9)0.114Stroke/TIA105 (9.2)45 (10.0)0.61133 (8.8)25 (8.3)0.828CKD stage 3-5510 (69.4)225 (30.6)0.050189 (50.3)168 (55.8)0.151Cardiac devices PPM139 (12.1)54 (12.0)0.93662 (16.5)39 (13.0)0.200 ICD24 (2.1)13 (2.9)0.34512 (3.2)10 (3.3)0.924 CRT-D12 (1.1)6 (1.3)0.7445 (1.3)6 (2.0)0.497 CRT-P22 (1.9)7 (1.6)0.6223 (0.8)3 (1.0)0.784Heart failure severity NYHA functional class0.044<0.001 I174 (15.2)a47 (10.4)95 (25.3)a47 (15.6) II699 (60.9)285 (63.2)207 (55.1)169 (55.1) III212 (18.5)99 (22.0)74 (19.7)a80 (26.6) IV12 (1.0)7 (1.6)0 (0.0)a5 (1.7) Missing501300 NAC stage<0.001<0.001 1662 (57.7)a205 (45.5)233 (62.0)a140 (46.5) 2350 (30.5)a181 (40.1)88 (23.4)108 (35.9) 3135 (11.8)65 (14.4)55 (14.6)53 (17.6)NT-proBNP, ng/L2,309 (1,218-4,163)3,095 (1,656-5,590)<0.0011,786 (706-3,697)2782 (1,293-5,155)<0.001eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m262 (50-77)59 (48-76)0.06260 (47-75)57 (44-71)0.090Echocardiographic parameters IVSd, mm16.6 ± 2.517.1 ± 2.3<0.00117.6 ± 3.718.1 ± 3.20.005 PWTd, mm16.2 ± 2.716.7 ± 2.2<0.00114.3 ± 3.215.7 ± 6.5<0.001 LVEF, %49.0 ± 10.548.0 ± 10.30.07053.0 ± 10.551.8 ± 10.30.076Medications Beta-blockers607 (52.9)261 (57.9)0.074210 (55.9)179 (59.5)0.344 ACEI/ARBs664 (57.9)253 (56.1)0.514198 (52.7)175 (58.1)0.154 ARNI11 (1.0)2 (0.4)0.30211 (2.9)5 (1.7)0.282 MRAs453 (39.5)197 (43.7)0.125125 (33.2)100 (33.2)0.995 SGT2i23 (2.0)6 (1.3)0.3637 (1.9)5 (1.7)0.844 Loop diuretic818 (71.3)300 (66.5)0.060250 (66.5)212 (70.4)0.274 Thiazide diuretic53 (4.6)14 (3.1)0.17322 (5.9)21 (7.0)0.543Values are mean ± SD, n (%), n, or median (Q1-Q3).ODI = outpatient diuretic intensification; other abbreviations as in Table 1.aP values for pairwise comparison <0.05.

In the NAC cohort, patients who experienced ODI had a higher death rate (26.5 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 23.6-29.7 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (14.3 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 13.1-15.7 deaths per 100 py). ODI was associated with a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.62-2.18; P < 0.001). The associated risk of mortality was dose-dependent, with patients who experienced the greatest degree of ODI having the highest risk of mortality (Supplemental Material, Figure 3). The increased risk of mortality associated with ODI was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.48-2.11; P < 0.001), p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.08-2.01; P = 0.013), and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 3.65; 95% CI: 2.29-5.81; P < 0.001).Figure 3Degree of ODI and SurvivalLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between the degree of ODI at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between ODI and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.58-2.04; P < 0.001), and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between ODI and mortality. ODI was also associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with NAC stage 1 disease (HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.52-2.34; P < 0.001), NAC stage 2 disease (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.25-1.86; P < 0.001), and NAC stage 3 disease (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07-1.87; P = 0.015).

In the whole study population, 515 patients were prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials; and had assessments at the start date, and 1 year after the start date. In this subgroup, 143 (27.7%) patients experienced ODI, and patients who experienced ODI had a higher death rate (16.3 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 11.7-22.8 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (5.9 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 4.2-8.2 deaths per 100 py). ODI was associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.72-4.45; P < 0.001).

In a multivariable analysis with covariates of age and NAC disease stage, both NT-proBNP progression (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.42-1.89; P < 0.001) and ODI (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.38-1.85; P < 0.001) were independently associated with mortality, and this was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA, p.(V142I) hATTR-CA, and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). The likelihood ratio test demonstrated that the addition of NT-proBNP progression to ODI added a significant contribution to the multivariable model (chi-square = 56.36; P < 0.001) and significantly improved the discriminatory ability of the classification compared with ODI alone (Harrell’s c-statistic: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.58-0.64 vs 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55-0.60; P < 0.001).

Within the NAC cohort, patients who had a stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose at 1 year had a death rate of 11.5 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 10.3-13.0 deaths per 100 py), compared with 21.9 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 19.8-24.4 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced either NT-proBNP or ODI progression, and 33.2 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 28.0-39.3 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI. Compared with patients with a stable diuretic dose and stable NT-proBNP, those who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI had a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.65-2.27; P < 0.001), and those who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI had a 3.0-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.42-3.67; P < 0.001). When compared with patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, those who experienced both had a 1.5-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.26-1.88; P < 0.001). The increased risk of mortality associated with both NT-proBNP progression and ODI was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA, p.(V142I) hATTR, and non-p.(V142I) hATTR (Supplemental Material).

In the external validation cohort, patients who had a stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose at 1 year had a death rate of 7.4 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 5.5-9.92 deaths per 100 py), compared with 14.4 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 11.7-17.6 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, and 23.7 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 18.1-31.1 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI. Compared with patients with a stable diuretic dose and stable NT-proBNP, those who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI had a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.36-2.77; P < 0.001), and those who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI had a 3.2-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.17-4.79; P < 0.001). When compared with patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, those who experienced both had a 1.7-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.19-2.33; P = 0.003) (Figure 5).Figure 5Combination NT-proBNP Progression and ODILandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between the NT-proBNP progression and ODI at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between the combined variables and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose vs either NT-proBNP progression or ODI: HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.62-2.17; P < 0.001; stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose vs NT-proBNP progression and ODI: HR: 2.88; 95% CI: 2.40-3.45; P < 0.001), and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between the combined variables and mortality. The increased risk of mortality associated with both NT-proBNP progression and ODI was consistent across patients with NAC stage 1, 2, and 3 disease (Supplemental Material).

### NT-proBNP progression

At 1-year post diagnosis, 551 (34.5%) of NAC patients and 204 (30.1%) of patients in the external validation cohort experienced NT-proBNP progression. In patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression, the median NT-proBNP increased from 2,613 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 1,463-4,604 ng/L) to 4,860 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 3,112-8,822 ng/L). Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression were older, and had a higher prevalence of p.(V142I) hATTR-CA. Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a greater left ventricular wall thickness and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than those who did not. Patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression were more commonly prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers and loop diuretics than those who did not (Table 2).Table 2Comparison of Patients Who Experienced NT-proBNP Progression With Those Who Did NotNAC CohortExternal Validation CohortStable NT-proBNP (n = 1,047, 65.5%)NT-proBNP Progression (n = 551, 33.5%)P ValueStable NT-proBNP (n = 473, 69.9%)NT-proBNP Progression (n = 204, 30.1%)P ValueAge, y75.2 ± 8.676.6 ± 7.30.00477.8 ± 7.779.8 ± 6.60.002Male900 (86.0)480 (87.1)0.523411 (86.9)176 (86.3)0.828Genotype<0.0010.433 Wild type737 (70.4)373 (67.7)422 (89.2)186 (91.2) p.(V142I)138 (13.2)a114 (20.7)6 (1.3)4 (2.0) Non-p.(V142I)172 (16.4)a64 (11.6)45 (9.5)14 (6.9)AF/AFL522 (49.9)254 (46.1)0.153256 (54.1)118 (57.8)0.372IHD191 (18.2)96 (17.4)0.685100 (21.1)47 (23.0)0.584Diabetes mellitus135 (12.9)99 (18.0)0.00689 (18.8)33 (16.2)0.412Stroke/TIA97 (9.3)53 (9.6)0.81741 (8.7)17 (8.3)0.886CKD stage 3-5438 (41.8)297 (53.9)<0.001240 (50.7)117 (57.4)0.114Cardiac devices PPM118 (11.3)75 (13.6)0.17270 (14.8)31 (15.2)0.894 ICD26 (2.5)11 (2.0)0.53812 (2.5)10 (4.9)0.111 CRT-D15 (1.4)4 (0.7)0.2156 (1.3)5 (2.5)0.264 CRT-P18 (1.7)11 (2.0)0.6934 (0.8)2 (1.0)0.864Heart failure severity NYHA functional class0.0220.350 I160 (15.3)a61 (11.1)104 (22.0)38 (18.6) II623 (59.5)a361 (65.5)263 (55.6)113 (55.4) III204 (19.5)107 (19.4)104 (22.0)50 (24.5) IV16 (1.5)3 (0.5)2 (0.4)3 (1.5) Missing441900 NAC stage0.0070.460 1597 (57.0)a270 (49.0)268 (56.7)105 (51.5) 2331 (31.6)200 (36.3)132 (27.9)64 (31.4) 3119 (11.4)81 (14.7)73 (15.4)35 (17.2) NT-proBNP, ng/L2,291 (1,150-4,482)2,732 (1,612-4,717)<0.0011,984 (854-4,489)2,365 (1,090-4,238)0.153 eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m264 (52-79)58 (47-72)<0.00159 (47-74)56 (43-71)0.039Echocardiographic parameters IVSd, mm16.6 ± 2.517.0 ± 2.30.00916.6 ± 3.618.2 ± 3.30.021 PWTd, mm16.2 ± 2.716.6 ± 2.40.01114.7 ± 5.615.3 ± 3.30.001 LVEF, %49.0 ± 10.748.3 ± 10.10.16352.7 ± 10.651.9 ± 10.00.275Medications Beta-blockers551 (52.6)317 (57.5)0.061270 (57.1)119 (58.3)0.763 ACEI/ARBs575 (54.9)342 (62.1)0.006244 (51.6)129 (63.2)0.005 ARNI12 (1.2)1 (0.2)0.03112 (2.5)4 (2.0)0.651 MRAs418 (39.9)232 (42.1)0.399143 (30.2)82 (40.2)0.012 SGT2i19 (1.8)10 (1.8)0.9998 (1.7)4 (2.0)0.807 Loop diuretic701 (67.0)417 (75.7)<0.001304 (64.3)158 (77.5)<0.001 Thiazide diuretic36 (3.4)31 (5.6)0.03829 (6.1)14 (6.9)0.720Values are mean ± SD, n (%), n, or median (Q1-Q3).Abbreviations as in Table 1.aP values for pairwise comparison <0.05.

In the NAC cohort, patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (25.0 deaths per 100 person-years [py]; 95% CI: 22.4-27.8 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (14.0 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 12.8-15.4 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.57-2.10; P < 0.001). The increased risk of mortality associated with NT-proBNP progression was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.40-2.00; P < 0.001), p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.27-2.32; P < 0.001), and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.52-3.57; P < 0.001).

In the external validation cohort, patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (18.4 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 14.8-22.9 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (10.6 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 8.8-12.8 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.32-2.33; P < 0.001) (Figure 1).Figure 1NT-proBNP Progression and SurvivalLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) progression at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between NT-proBNP progression and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.59-2.05; P < 0.001) and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between NT-proBNP progression and mortality. NT-proBNP progression was associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with NAC stage 1 disease (HR: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.90-2.89; P < 0.001) and NAC stage 2 disease (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.24-1.86; P < 0.001), but not in those with NAC stage 3 disease (HR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.97-1.72; P = 0.08); however, assessment in this subgroup was limited by the small sample size. Nevertheless, the 95% CI contains values that suggest NT-proBNP progression could be associated with an increased risk of mortality. NT-proBNP progression was also associated with an increased risk of mortality in a subgroup of obese patients and in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation (Supplemental Material).

When compared with the NT-proBNP cutoffs recommended in the consensus document, the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression demonstrated improved discrimination in the external validation cohort (Harrell’s c-statistic: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.48-0.59 vs 0.56; 95% CI: 0.50-0.61; P = 0.033). Comparison between the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression and both NT-proBNP cutoffs recommended in the consensus document and cutoffs previously used in patients with wtATTR-CA, demonstrated that the novel definition of NT-proBNP progression produced the most consistent HRs across different genotypes, and across the NAC cohort and the external validation cohort (Supplemental Table 1).

In the whole study population, 515 patients were prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials; and had assessments at the start date, and 1 year after the start date (Supplemental Figure 1). In this subgroup, 131 (25.4%) patients experienced NT-proBNP progression, and patients who experienced NT-proBNP progression had a higher death rate (17.5 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 12.5-24.5 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (5.7 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 4.1-8.0 deaths per 100 py). NT-proBNP progression was associated with a 3.0-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.87-4.87; P < 0.001) (Figure 2A).Figure 2Disease Progression in Clinical Trials and Disease-Modifying TherapyLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between (A) N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) progression and (B) outpatient diuretic intensification (ODI) at 1 year, and subsequent survival in patients enrolled into clinical trials or prescribed disease-modifying therapy.

### Outpatient diuretic intensification

At 1 year, 451 (28.2%) NAC patients and 301 (44.5%) patients in the external validation cohort experienced ODI. Patients who experienced ODI were older and had a higher prevalence of p.(V142I) hATTR-CA and atrial fibrillation compared with those who did not experience ODI. Patients who experienced ODI had a worse functional capacity as evidenced by NYHA functional class and more severe cardiac phenotype evidenced by a higher median NT-proBNP, and greater wall thickness than those who did not. Among patients receiving loop diuretics the median furosemide dose at baseline was similar between the patients who experienced ODI and those who did not in both the NAC cohort (40 mg [40-80 mg]), and the external validation cohort (40 mg [25-75 mg]) (Table 3).Table 3Comparison of Patients Who Experienced Outpatient Diuretic Intensification to Those Who Did NotNAC CohortExternal Validation CohortNo ODI (n = 1,147, 71.8%)ODI (n = 451, 28.2%)P ValueNo ODI (n = 376, 55.5%)ODI (n = 301, 44.5%)P ValueAge, y75.2 ± 8.576.9 ± 7.1<0.00177.6 ± 7.979.4 ± 6.70.003Male979 (85.4)401 (88.9)0.062328 (87.2)259 (86.0)0.651Genotype<0.0010.252 Wild type785 (68.4)325 (72.1)341 (90.7)267 (88.7) p.(V142I)168 (14.6)a84 (18.6)3 (0.8)7 (2.3) Non-p.(V142I)194 (16.9)a42 (9.3)32 (8.5)27 (9.0)AF/AFL539 (47.0)237 (52.5)0.045190 (50.5)184 (61.1)0.006IHD192 (16.7)95 (21.1)0.04377 (20.5)70 (23.3)0.078Diabetes mellitus157 (13.7)77 (17.1)0.08559 (15.7)63 (20.9)0.114Stroke/TIA105 (9.2)45 (10.0)0.61133 (8.8)25 (8.3)0.828CKD stage 3-5510 (69.4)225 (30.6)0.050189 (50.3)168 (55.8)0.151Cardiac devices PPM139 (12.1)54 (12.0)0.93662 (16.5)39 (13.0)0.200 ICD24 (2.1)13 (2.9)0.34512 (3.2)10 (3.3)0.924 CRT-D12 (1.1)6 (1.3)0.7445 (1.3)6 (2.0)0.497 CRT-P22 (1.9)7 (1.6)0.6223 (0.8)3 (1.0)0.784Heart failure severity NYHA functional class0.044<0.001 I174 (15.2)a47 (10.4)95 (25.3)a47 (15.6) II699 (60.9)285 (63.2)207 (55.1)169 (55.1) III212 (18.5)99 (22.0)74 (19.7)a80 (26.6) IV12 (1.0)7 (1.6)0 (0.0)a5 (1.7) Missing501300 NAC stage<0.001<0.001 1662 (57.7)a205 (45.5)233 (62.0)a140 (46.5) 2350 (30.5)a181 (40.1)88 (23.4)108 (35.9) 3135 (11.8)65 (14.4)55 (14.6)53 (17.6)NT-proBNP, ng/L2,309 (1,218-4,163)3,095 (1,656-5,590)<0.0011,786 (706-3,697)2782 (1,293-5,155)<0.001eGFR, mL/min/1.73 m262 (50-77)59 (48-76)0.06260 (47-75)57 (44-71)0.090Echocardiographic parameters IVSd, mm16.6 ± 2.517.1 ± 2.3<0.00117.6 ± 3.718.1 ± 3.20.005 PWTd, mm16.2 ± 2.716.7 ± 2.2<0.00114.3 ± 3.215.7 ± 6.5<0.001 LVEF, %49.0 ± 10.548.0 ± 10.30.07053.0 ± 10.551.8 ± 10.30.076Medications Beta-blockers607 (52.9)261 (57.9)0.074210 (55.9)179 (59.5)0.344 ACEI/ARBs664 (57.9)253 (56.1)0.514198 (52.7)175 (58.1)0.154 ARNI11 (1.0)2 (0.4)0.30211 (2.9)5 (1.7)0.282 MRAs453 (39.5)197 (43.7)0.125125 (33.2)100 (33.2)0.995 SGT2i23 (2.0)6 (1.3)0.3637 (1.9)5 (1.7)0.844 Loop diuretic818 (71.3)300 (66.5)0.060250 (66.5)212 (70.4)0.274 Thiazide diuretic53 (4.6)14 (3.1)0.17322 (5.9)21 (7.0)0.543Values are mean ± SD, n (%), n, or median (Q1-Q3).ODI = outpatient diuretic intensification; other abbreviations as in Table 1.aP values for pairwise comparison <0.05.

In the NAC cohort, patients who experienced ODI had a higher death rate (26.5 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 23.6-29.7 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (14.3 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 13.1-15.7 deaths per 100 py). ODI was associated with a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.62-2.18; P < 0.001). The associated risk of mortality was dose-dependent, with patients who experienced the greatest degree of ODI having the highest risk of mortality (Supplemental Material, Figure 3). The increased risk of mortality associated with ODI was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.48-2.11; P < 0.001), p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.08-2.01; P = 0.013), and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (HR: 3.65; 95% CI: 2.29-5.81; P < 0.001).Figure 3Degree of ODI and SurvivalLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between the degree of ODI at 1 year and subsequent survival.

In the external validation cohort, patients who experienced ODI had a higher death rate (18.0 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 15.1-21.7 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (8.8 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 7.0-11.1 deaths per 100 py). ODI was associated with a 2.1-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.53-2.74; P < 0.001) (Figure 4).Figure 4ODI and SurvivalLandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between ODI at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between ODI and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.58-2.04; P < 0.001), and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between ODI and mortality. ODI was also associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with NAC stage 1 disease (HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.52-2.34; P < 0.001), NAC stage 2 disease (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.25-1.86; P < 0.001), and NAC stage 3 disease (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.07-1.87; P = 0.015).

In the whole study population, 515 patients were prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials; and had assessments at the start date, and 1 year after the start date. In this subgroup, 143 (27.7%) patients experienced ODI, and patients who experienced ODI had a higher death rate (16.3 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 11.7-22.8 deaths per 100 py) than those who did not (5.9 deaths per 100 py; 95% CI: 4.2-8.2 deaths per 100 py). ODI was associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.72-4.45; P < 0.001).

### Combined ODI and NT-proBNP progression

In a multivariable analysis with covariates of age and NAC disease stage, both NT-proBNP progression (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.42-1.89; P < 0.001) and ODI (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.38-1.85; P < 0.001) were independently associated with mortality, and this was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA, p.(V142I) hATTR-CA, and non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). The likelihood ratio test demonstrated that the addition of NT-proBNP progression to ODI added a significant contribution to the multivariable model (chi-square = 56.36; P < 0.001) and significantly improved the discriminatory ability of the classification compared with ODI alone (Harrell’s c-statistic: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.58-0.64 vs 0.57; 95% CI: 0.55-0.60; P < 0.001).

Within the NAC cohort, patients who had a stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose at 1 year had a death rate of 11.5 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 10.3-13.0 deaths per 100 py), compared with 21.9 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 19.8-24.4 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced either NT-proBNP or ODI progression, and 33.2 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 28.0-39.3 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI. Compared with patients with a stable diuretic dose and stable NT-proBNP, those who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI had a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.65-2.27; P < 0.001), and those who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI had a 3.0-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 2.98; 95% CI: 2.42-3.67; P < 0.001). When compared with patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, those who experienced both had a 1.5-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.26-1.88; P < 0.001). The increased risk of mortality associated with both NT-proBNP progression and ODI was consistent across patients with wtATTR-CA, p.(V142I) hATTR, and non-p.(V142I) hATTR (Supplemental Material).

In the external validation cohort, patients who had a stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose at 1 year had a death rate of 7.4 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 5.5-9.92 deaths per 100 py), compared with 14.4 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 11.7-17.6 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, and 23.7 deaths per 100 py (95% CI: 18.1-31.1 deaths per 100 py) in patients who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI. Compared with patients with a stable diuretic dose and stable NT-proBNP, those who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI had a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.36-2.77; P < 0.001), and those who experienced both NT-proBNP progression and ODI had a 3.2-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 3.23; 95% CI: 2.17-4.79; P < 0.001). When compared with patients who experienced either NT-proBNP progression or ODI, those who experienced both had a 1.7-fold higher risk of mortality (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.19-2.33; P = 0.003) (Figure 5).Figure 5Combination NT-proBNP Progression and ODILandmark Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrating the association between the NT-proBNP progression and ODI at 1 year and subsequent survival.

These findings were confirmed in the internal validation, whereby the association between the combined variables and mortality was assessed in the whole study population (stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose vs either NT-proBNP progression or ODI: HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.62-2.17; P < 0.001; stable NT-proBNP and stable diuretic dose vs NT-proBNP progression and ODI: HR: 2.88; 95% CI: 2.40-3.45; P < 0.001), and the bootstrapped results indicated that the coefficients remained constant across the resamples, suggesting robustness in the association between the combined variables and mortality. The increased risk of mortality associated with both NT-proBNP progression and ODI was consistent across patients with NAC stage 1, 2, and 3 disease (Supplemental Material).

### Discussion

This multicenter longitudinal study of >2,000 patients with ATTR-CA demonstrated that: 1) an increase in NT-proBNP of >700 ng/L and >30% was frequent (1 in 3 patients) and consistently associated with an increased risk of mortality; 2) ODI was similarly frequent (1 in 3 patients) and consistently associated with an increased risk of mortality; and 3) the combination of an increase in NT-proBNP of >700 ng/L and >30%, and ODI enabled further refinement of risk. These results were consistent across the overall population and different genotypes. Both variables are extremely informative on the rate of disease progression and associated prognosis, and therefore could be highly relevant both in clinical practice to stratify disease progression, and as a modifiable endpoint in clinical trials of patients with ATTR-CA.

ATTR-CA is an inexorably progressive cardiomyopathy, and patients experience worsening heart failure signs and symptoms throughout the course of the disease. However, rate of disease progression is extremely variable, likely reflecting the complex nature of ATTR-CA. Determinants of disease progression are multifactorial, and depend on the underlying genotype, treatment, and comorbidities, hence there is an urgent need to define the disease course and stratify progression at an individual patient level.7,16,17 Since its discovery, NT-proBNP has been widely used in heart failure to stratify risk and as a marker of treatment response, with favorable changes being associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular events.8 Likewise, changes in NT-proBNP have been used in the assessment of ATTR amyloid-specific disease-modifying therapies. The ATTR-ACT (Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial), ATTRibute-CM (Efficacy and Safety of AG10 in Subjects With Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy) trial, and APOLLO-B (A Study to Evaluate Patisiran in Participants With Transthyretin Amyloidosis With Cardiomyopathy [ATTR Amyloidosis With Cardiomyopathy]) trial demonstrated that tafamidis, acoramidis, and patisiran, respectively, were all associated with a smaller increase in NT-proBNP compared with placebo.5,18,19 However, there is no NT-proBNP cutoff that can be used at an individual patient level to stratify disease progression across all genotypes. The cutoffs used in a small cohort of patients with wtATTR-CA are yet to be validated or applied to patients with hATTR-CA, or patients prescribed disease-modifying therapy, whereas the cutoffs proposed in a recent consensus document are not supported by data from patients with ATTR-CA.9,10

The current study established that NT-proBNP progression (defined as an absolute increase >700 ng/L and relative increase >30%) at 1 year was frequent, occurring in roughly one-third of patients at the NAC, and roughly one-third of patients in the external validation cohort. NT-proBNP progression was more frequent in patients prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers and loop diuretics, possibly reflecting more advanced cardiac disease at diagnosis.16 NT-proBNP progression was consistently associated with a 1.8-fold higher risk of mortality in both cohorts, and the subgroup of patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation. NT-proBNP progression conferred the highest risk in patients with non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA, and lowest risk in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR-CA. When compared with the thresholds recommended in the most recent consensus document and the cutoff proposed for patients with wtATTR-CA,9,10 our novel definition of NT-proBNP progression demonstrated improved discrimination and remarkable consistency with regard to HRs across the NAC cohort and external validation cohort. The novel thresholds were associated with an increased risk of mortality in all 3 genotypes, and also identified patients at an increased risk despite being prescribed disease-modifying therapy or enrolled into clinical trials. These results should support the widespread adoption of these NT-proBNP cutoffs to identify patients experiencing disease progression.

Worsening heart failure is often handled in the outpatient setting with intensification of loop diuretic therapy. ODI is frequent in patients with ATTR-CA, with more than one-quarter of patients at the NAC and almost one-half of the external validation cohort experiencing ODI in the first year after diagnosis.11,12 ODI was associated with a 1.9-fold higher risk of mortality in the overall NAC cohort, and 2.1-fold higher risk of mortality in the external validation cohort, hence confirming the remarkable consistency with regard to associated risk across multiple international specialist centers, in spite of possible differences in individual clinical practices and the propensity to escalate diuretic therapy. The associated risk varied among the genotypes, and ranged from a 1.5-fold higher risk in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR-CA to a 3.7-fold higher risk in patients with non-p.(V142I) hATTR-CA. The observed differences are probably related to differences in the cardiac phenotype, with the p.(V142I) genotype being associated with more advanced and rapidly progressive cardiac disease, whereas patients with non-p.(V142I) hATTR present with a milder cardiac phenotype.7 NT-proBNP progression and ODI occur less frequently in patients with a milder cardiac phenotype, compared with patients with more advanced disease. Therefore, these markers possibly provide a more specific signal that is more representative of disease progression in patients with milder disease. This is supported by the associated risk being highest in patients with NAC stage 1 (mild) disease, and lowest risk in patients with NAC stage 3 (severe) disease.

In the setting of ATTR-CA, multiple underlying pathophysiological processes are responsible for the elevation of serum NT-proBNP, including direct cardiac amyloid infiltration, neurohormonal activation, renal filtration, and fluid status, and this forms the basis of the strong prognostic significance of NT-proBNP in cardiac amyloidosis.20 In response to disease progression, ODI is frequent and strongly associated with mortality, but also influences NT-proBNP levels, with a variable response in different individuals, ranging from reduction, to stabilization or increase in NT-proBNP.13 Therefore, the combination of the presence or absence of diuretic intensification and change in NT-proBNP provides incremental information compared with each individual variable, and allows further refinement of the risk of mortality (Central Illustration). Despite recent advances in diagnostics that have resulted in most patients being diagnosed earlier in the disease process, a significant proportion are still diagnosed with advanced cardiac disease.7 Although both NT-proBNP progression and ODI confer the highest risk in patients with milder cardiac disease, importantly the combination of these variables remains associated with an increased risk of mortality across the spectrum of disease severity.Central IllustrationN-Terminal Pro–B-Type Natriuretic Peptide Progression and Outpatient Diuretic Intensification Detect Disease ProgressionN-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) progression and outpatient diuretic intensification (ODI) are associated with an increased risk of mortality.

Combining both variables produces a simple, universally applicable model that detects disease progression in the National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) and external validation cohorts.

Considering the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape, where several novel compounds are likely to become available, there remains an unmet clinical need to define markers of disease progression. Troponin-T progression (defined as an increase >10 ng/L and >20%) was associated with mortality in a subgroup of patients who had serial measurements at baseline and 1 year (Supplemental Figures 2 and 3); however, the widespread use of troponin as a marker of disease progression is significantly limited by the current worldwide use of multiple different troponin assays, with different specialist centers favoring different assays.20 Serial echocardiographic assessments lack the precision to track disease progression, and although worsening stroke volume and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are associated with mortality, these parameters are challenging to quantify, and subject to significant intraobserver and interobserver variability.21 Although cardiac magnetic resonance with multiparametric mapping has demonstrated utility in tracking treatment response in cardiac light-chain amyloidosis, this imaging modality is costly, only available in highly specialized centers, and cannot be used in patients with cardiac devices.22,23 The identification of NT-proBNP progression and ODI as surrogate markers of disease progression in ATTR-CA is of great importance. Because of their simplicity, lack of operator variability, wide availability, and universal applicability across genotypes, these novel measures of disease progression could easily be applied to clinical practice with significant implications in terms of guiding optimization of treatment strategies, and also as potential endpoints in clinical trials. NT-proBNP progression and ODI are common occurrences in ATTR-CA, and their inclusion may lead to an important increment in event rates, which could in turn influence contemporary trial design, with fewer patients and a reduced follow-up duration being required to evaluate the efficacy of novel agents.

There is a survival bias in that this study only included patients with follow-up 1 year after diagnosis, and therefore it may be that the extent of differences is underestimated, and rapid disease progression may have resulted in death before the follow-up assessment. There is a possible selection bias as patients who were too unwell to attend an assessment would not have been included. Inclusion was limited to specialist referral centers, and therefore validation of these markers in a community or general cardiology setting is important. The definition of ODI was limited to new initiation or dose increase of loop diuretics, as they represent the mainstay of volume control in heart failure. Augmentation using thiazide diuretics was not considered, given inherent limitations in dose conversion between loop and nonloop diuretics.

### Conclusions

In this large cohort of patients with ATTR-CA, NT-proBNP progression and ODI were frequent and consistently associated with an increased risk of mortality. Combining both variables produces a simple, universally applicable model that detects disease progression. NT-proBNP progression and ODI represent novel outcomes that, if included in contemporary clinical trials, could allow the capture of more clinically meaningful and potentially modifiable events at earlier stages of disease.PerspectivesCOMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: Elevation of plasma NT-proBNP and ODI in patients with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis are associated with disease progression and increased mortality.TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Incorporation of NT-proBNP progression and ODI in clinical studies could facilitate earlier recognition of clinically meaningful and potentially modifiable events in patients with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis.
