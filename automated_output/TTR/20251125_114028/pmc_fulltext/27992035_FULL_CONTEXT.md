## Speckle Tracking and Transthyretin Amyloid
Cardiomyopathy

### Abstract

BackgroundAmyloidosis is a disease caused by deposits of insoluble fibrils in
extracellular spaces. The most common type of familial amyloidosis is
mediated by mutation of transthyretin, especially Val30Met. Symptoms and
ejection fraction decrease may occur in cardiac amyloidosis only in case of
poor prognosis. Myocardial strain detected by two-dimensional speckle
tracking echocardiography can indicate changes in myocardial function at
early stages of the disease.ObjectiveTo determine the accuracy of left ventricular longitudinal strain by
two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography in patients with familial
amyloidosis caused by Val30Met transthyretin mutation.MethodsEighteen consecutive patients, carriers of transthyretin mutation, were
evaluated by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, by which
myocardial strain curves were obtained, following the American Society of
Echocardiography recommendations.ResultsPatients were divided into three groups: 1- Val30Met with cardiac
amyloidosis; 2-Val30Met with extracardiac amyloidosis; 3 - Val30Met without
evidence of disease. As the three groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney
test, we found a statistically significant difference between groups 1 and 2
in the mean longitudinal tension (p=0.01), mean basal longitudinal strain
(p=0.014); in mean longitudinal tension and mean longitudinal strain between
groups 1 and 3 (p=0.005); and in the ratio of longitudinal strain of apical
septum segment to longitudinal strain of basal septum (p=0.041) between
groups 2 and 3.ConclusionLeft ventricular longitudinal strain detected by two-dimensional speckle
tracking echocardiography is able to diagnose left ventricular dysfunction
in early stages of familial amyloidosis caused by transthyretin Val30Met
mutation.

### Introduction

Amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by deposits of proteins in the extracellular
space of organs and tissues. The familial forms of the disease are commonly
associated with mutations of genes related to proteins. The most frequent is
transthyretin (TTR), a protein that is synthesized in the liver, choroid plexus and
retina, and that acts in the transport of thyroxine (T4) and retinol-binding protein
in the blood.1 The TTR gene is
located on chromosome 18q12.1.2 The
best described, most prevalent mutation is Val30Met (a methionine substitution for
valine at position 30), which predominantly affects patients from Japan, Portugal,
Sweden and Brazil.3 Amyloidosis symptoms appear in the third to fifth
decades of life, including progressive polyneuropathy, postural hypotension, and
mild myocardial infiltration. The main clinical manifestations of cardiac
amyloidosis (CA) are: restrictive heart disease, systolic dysfunction, postural
hypotension and conduction disturbances. Rapezzi et al. reported a 98% survival
after two years of TTR CA.4

Echocardiography is the cornerstone for evaluation of CA due to ease of image
acquisition and interpretation, relative low cost, and capacity for unparalleled
assessment of diastolic function and serial studies. The echocardiogram may show
symmetrical thickening of left ventricular (LV) wall, hypokinesia, right ventricular
free wall thickening, atrial septal thickening, valve thickening or valve failure,
atrial dilatation and pericardial effusion5 (Figure 1). Two
dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) consists in the capture and
tracking of speckles along the cardiac cycle, generating motion vectors and
deformation curves. The method has been used to measure myocardial deformation and
the percentage of deformation. LV global systolic function remains normal until the
final stages of CA. However, in contrast to LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and
shortening fraction, the global longitudinal strain may be altered in the first
stages of the disease. Thus, new imaging techniques, as the STE, have been suggested
for the evaluation of patients with CA.6-14 The aim of our
study was to determine the accuracy of LV longitudinal strain obtained by
two-dimensional STE in a group of patient with familial amyloidosis caused by the
Val30Met mutation of TTR.

### Methods

This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative study on CA patients and genetic
carriers of Val30Met mutation, and individuals without the mutation and without
cardiovascular diseases as controls. Twenty-eight patients were selected and
assessed from February 2014 to March 2015. Patients were divided into four groups -
patients with familial CA with Val30Met mutation (n=6); patients with Val30Met
mutation with diagnosis of familial extracardiac amyloidosis confirmed by biopsy
(n=4); patients with Val30Met without amyloidosis (n=4); and a control group
(n=14).

Patients were enrolled in the outpatient neurology service of Antonio Pedro
University Hospital and in private offices of neurology run by professors of this
hospital, and by contact to the Brazilian Association of Paramyloidosis by
internet.

Sample calculation was based on the following assumptions:

In a similar study, Phelan et al.15
selected 26 patients with TTR. We took this number as a reference for our sample
calculation.

The expected margin of error is 5%, with 95% confidence error. The distribution of CA
in this population is unknown; however, we extrapolated the value of 50% of primary
amyloidosis (AL) distribution, and used it as reference for our sample
calculation.

We used the online sample calculator available at http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html, and the sample size
calculated was 26.

### Discussion

As we compared the mean values of longitudinal strain per LV segments between G1 and
G3, we found a statistically significant decrease in these values in the basal,
anterolateral (p=0.019) and in the medial inferolateral segments in G1 (p=0.042).
The same was observed in the basal inferoseptal (p=0.009), anteromedial (p=0.010),
inferior medial (p=0.054), inferolateral medial (p=0.010) and apical septum
(p=0.032) in G2, and in the basal inferoseptal (p=0.006), basal anterior (p=0.017),
basal inferior (p=0.031), basal anterolateral (p=0.001), basal inferolateral
(p=0.010), medial inferior (p=0.025) and apical anterior (p=0.013) in G4. It is of
note that mean values of longitudinal strain were decreased in G1 not only as
compared with G3, but also in absolute values (<-18%). On the other hand,
longitudinal strain of apical segments, even when decreased in relation to other
groups, was not decreased in absolute values.

The two-dimensional STE showed that apical segments were not affected by amyloidosis,
ATTR or AL, which differs from the pattern of both HCM and aortic stenosis that do
not spare the apex. Only apical strain was different between ATTR and AL, and
significantly lower in ATTR patients. However, no difference was detected in global
longitudinal strain or in the mean basal or medial longitudinal strain between the
two types of amyloidosis15 (see
Figure 2).

segments.

segments.

Mean basal longitudinal strain was lower in G1 as compared with G3 (p=0.010), G2
(p=0.014) and G4 (p=0.0005). According to Baccouche et al. this parameter has a
differential diagnostic value between AC and HCM.18

When we evaluated global longitudinal strain in G1, the mean longitudinal strain in
the apical two-chamber, four-chamber and three-chamber views (longitudinal apical),
as well as the mean longitudinal tension were significantly lower than in G2, G3 and
G4 groups.

Serial analysis showed that systolic strain rate and strain at the basal and mid
ventricle were significantly reduced in asymptomatic patients with increased LV wall
thickness.13 In addition,
the longitudinal systolic rate was reduced in all 16 segments of left ventricle in
CA patients, who did not have abnormal echo findings.19

There are few studies showing functional changes in patients with CA using
two-dimensional STE. Sun et al. showed that global longitudinal strain detected by
two-dimensional STE was significantly lower (12%) in CA patients as compared with
healthy controls, and also compared with patients with LV hypertrophy caused by HCM
or hypertensive disease.20

Liu et al. showed that the ejection fraction was preserved whereas longitudinal
strain was notably reduced in both compensated and decompensated patients (New York
Heart Association functional class > 2).21

Disturbances in electrical conduction are among the main clinical manifestations of
CA, and may be present in up to one third of patients.5 Patients in G1 had increased PR interval (mean of
0.230s ± 0.060), which was significantly different from G2 (p=0.015), G3
(p=0.044) and G4 (p=0.005). Sayed et al.22 also showed an association between disturbances in
electrical conduction and decreased longitudinal strain, and a negative prognostic
value for this association, although the study was conducted with cardiac AL
amyloidosis.

Left atrial diameter was significantly greater in the G1 group (4.0 cm ± 0.18)
than in G3 (p = 0.009), G2 (p = 0.009) and G4 (p= 0.0005). We also found increased
left atrial volume in G1 in the apical four-chamber view (p=0.028), biplane
(p=0.026) and indexed left atrial volume in the apical four-chamber view (p=0.010)
as compared with G4. Such difference may be a sign of increased pressure in the left
ventricle due to restrictive diastolic function, leading to pressure overload in the
left atrium.23

Mean values of LV end-systolic diameter and end-systolic volume were significantly
lower in G1 (p=0.009 and p=0.008, respectively) and G2 (p=0.025 and p=0.025,
respectively) as compared with G4. LV end-systolic volume was also significantly
lower (p=0.043) in G2 than G4. G1 showed mean LV end-diastolic diameter and
end-diastolic volume significantly lower than G3 (p=0.033 and p=0.033,
respectively), and G4 (p=0.029 and p=0.028, respectively). CA progresses with mild
decrease in LV cavity.24,25

Variables related to hypertrophy caused by amyloid deposit were statistically
different between G1 and G3. Mean diastolic thickness of the interventricular septum
in G1 was increased (1.17 ± 0.60 cm), and statistically greater than G3
(p=0.041) and G4 (p=0.010). The same was observed with LV posterior wall
end-diastolic thickness, with mean of 1.07 ± 0.39 cm in G1, which was
significantly different as compared with G3 (p=0.010), G2 (p=0.033) and G4 (0.008).
Mean values of interventricular septum was greater in G1 (1.17±0.60 cm) than
in G3 (p=0.041) and G4 (p=0.010). Mean wall thickness was significantly greater in
G1 than in G3 (p=0.024) and G4 (p=0.011). Mean relative wall thickness was also
increased in G1 (0.600 ± 0.346) compared with G3 (p=0.026) and G4 (p=0.005).
Our study shows a relationship between LV wall hypertrophy and severity of disease.
Mean wall hypertrophy greater than 15mm has been shown as an independent negative
prognostic factor.26

Amyloid deposits cause restrictive heart disease. The pattern of echocardiographic
parameters of diastolic dysfunction classification tend to worsen with the disease
progression.23 Patients of
G2 also showed increased mean lateral E/E' ratio compared with G3 (p=0.020). Lateral
E'-wave velocity on tissue Doppler was also decreased in G2 as compared with G3
(p=0.021). Medial and lateral E/E' ratio in G1 were increased (p=0.005 and p=0.033,
respectively) compared with G4.

Tricuspid annular S'-wave velocity on tissue Doppler is an index of right ventricular
systolic function, with normal values greater than 10 cm/s. Its mean values in G1
was significantly different from G3 (p=0.036) and G4 (p=0003). Capelli et
al.27 showed statistically
significant difference in tricuspid annulus tissue Doppler analysis between patients
with CA, patients with extracardiac amyloidosis and healthy controls, and reported a
negative prognostic value for right ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### Conclusions

Two-dimensional STE increased the sensitivity of echo in diagnosing CA caused by TTR
Val30Met mutation, since the adoption of a global longitudinal strain < -18%
criterion increased the number of diagnosed patients from two (diagnosed by echo) to
six patients.
