## Multiorgan Dysfunction and Associated Prognosis in Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis

### Abstract

BackgroundTransthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR‐CA) is a progressive and ultimately fatal cardiomyopathy. Biomarkers reflecting multiorgan dysfunction are of increasing importance in patients with heart failure; however, their significance in ATTR‐CA remains largely unknown. The aims of this study were to characterize the multifaceted nature of ATTR‐CA using blood biomarkers and assess the association between blood biomarkers and prognosis.Methods and ResultsThis is a retrospective cohort study of 2566 consecutive patients diagnosed with ATTR‐CA between 2007 and 2023. Anemia (39%), high urea (52%), hyperbilirubinemia (18%), increased alkaline phosphatase (16%), increased CRP (C‐reactive protein; 27%), and increased troponin (98.2%) were common findings in the overall population, whereas hyponatremia (6%) and hypoalbuminemia (2%) were less common. These abnormalities were most common in patients with p.(V142I) hereditary ATTR‐CA, and became more prevalent as the severity of cardiac disease increased. Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that anemia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19 [95% CI, 1.04–1.37]; P=0.01), high urea (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.04–1.45]; P=0.01), hyperbilirubinemia (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.13–1.57; P=0.001), increased alkaline phosphatase (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01–1.42; P=0.04), hyponatremia (HR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.28–2.11]; P<0.001), and troponin‐T >56 ng/L (HR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.46–2.03]; P<0.001) were all independently associated with mortality in the overall population. The association between biomarkers and mortality varied across the spectrum of genotypes and left ventricular ejection fraction, with anemia remining independently associated with mortality in p.(V142I) hereditary ATTR‐CA (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.17–2.12]; P=0.003) and in a subgroup of the overall population with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% (HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.08–1.81]; P=0.01).ConclusionsCardiac and noncardiac biomarker abnormalities were common and reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of ATTR‐CA, with a wide range of biomarkers remaining independently associated with mortality. Clinical trials are needed to investigate whether biomarker abnormalities represent modifiable risk factors that if specifically targeted could improve outcomes.

### What Is New?

In this large cohort of patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, both cardiac and noncardiac blood biomarker abnormalities were common and were more prevalent in patients with p.(V142I) hereditary transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis and advanced cardiac disease.Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis is a complex and multifaceted disease process, whereby multiple pathways involving different organs and systems, beyond cardiac infiltration, contribute to disease progression and prognosis.

### What Are the Clinical Implications?

Whether treatment aimed at reversing blood biomarker abnormalities in this population would potentially reduce the risk of mortality remains unknown; therefore, clinical trials are needed to investigate whether biomarker abnormalities represent modifiable risk factors that if specifically targeted could improve outcomes.

### Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are restricted by the institutional ethics committee to protect patient privacy, and therefore cannot be shared.

Consecutive patients diagnosed with ATTR‐CA between 2007 and 2023 at the National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC), and in whom a full blood cell count and serum biochemistry assessing renal function, liver function, and NT‐proBNP were measured at diagnosis were included. Blood biomarker normal ranges are displayed in Table S1. Data on ethnicity were self‐reported.

Between 2007 and 2010, the diagnosis of ATTR‐CA was established on the basis of HF symptoms together with a characteristic cardiac amyloidosis echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance and either direct endomyocardial biopsy proof of ATTR‐amyloid or ATTR‐amyloid in an extracardiac biopsy. From 2010 onwards, 99mtechnetium‐labeled 3,3‐diphosphono‐1,2‐propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy was used, and a diagnosis established on the basis of ATTR‐amyloid in an extracardiac biopsy with cardiac uptake on 99mtechnetium‐labeled 3,3‐diphosphono‐1,2‐propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy; or grade 2 to 3 cardiac uptake on 99mtechnetium‐labeled 3,3‐diphosphono‐1,2‐propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy in the absence of biochemical evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. All patients underwent genetic sequencing of the TTR gene and provided written consent for their data to be retrospectively analyzed and published, in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and approval from the Royal Free Hospital ethics committee (REC 21/PR/0620).

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (StataCorp, 2021, Stata Statistical Software: Release 17). All continuous variables were tested for normality (Shapiro‐Wilk test) and presented as mean±SD if the distribution was normal or median (interquartile range) otherwise. The independent samples t‐test was used to compare means if the data were normally distributed, or its nonparametric equivalent to compare the distributions of the 2 groups. One‐way ANOVA if the data were normally distributed in each group was used to compare means; or its nonparametric equivalent to compare the distributions of multiple groups. A significant result was followed by post hoc Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons to establish where differences lay. Standardized differences were also calculated to demonstrate the effect size between groups. Categorical data are presented as absolute numbers (n) and frequencies (%) and compared using the χ2 test.

Correlations between stroke volume and blood biomarkers were assessed using Spearman ρ. A multivariable linear regression model was used to assess the relationship between stroke volume and blood biomarkers.

All mortality data were obtained via the UK Office of National Statistics. The mortality end point was defined as time to death from baseline for all deceased patients and time to censor date (March 17, 2023) from baseline among the remainder. Follow‐up was restricted to ≤60 months, after which patients were censored because most events occurred in the first 60 months, and a low number of patients at risk after 60 months.

Blood biomarkers were assessed as continuous variables, z‐score standardized variables, and dichotomous variables (normal versus abnormal), except for troponin, whereby the optimal cutoff was established using a time‐dependant receiver operating characteristic curve, followed by the Liu method.

 The optimal cut point was 58 ng/L (sensitivity, 64.9%; specificity, 66.3%). A cut point of 56 ng/L (4×upper limit of normal) gave a sensitivity of 63.7% and a specificity of 67.2%, and was selected for the survival analysis. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between blood biomarkers and mortality. The proportional hazards assumption was checked and confirmed. The likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate the contribution of adding explanatory variables to the NAC disease stage. Multivariable Cox regression models were adjusted for known predictors of mortality and blood biomarkers selected a priori for clinical relevance. Possible collinearity among candidate predictors was assessed using variance inflation factors with threshold equal to 3. To account for the effect of amyloid‐specific disease‐modifying therapy or clinical trials, a second multivariable model was created as a sensitivity analysis, whereby patients were censored at their start date. Harrell's C statistic was calculated for the different models. Kaplan‐Meier curves were constructed with statistical significance being assessed with a log‐rank test. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.

### Results

We identified 2566 patients diagnosed with ATTR‐CA. The population comprised 1834 (71.5%) with wtATTR‐CA, 425 (16.6%) with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, and 307 (12.0%) with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. The mean age was 76.9±8.2 years, and 86.4% were men. When compared with wtATTR, patients with hATTR‐CA were younger, and a higher proportion were women. Most patients with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA were White, whereas most patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA were Black (Table 1).

P<0.05 for p.(V142I) hATTR vs non‐p.(V142I) hATTR. ATTR‐CA indicates transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; CRP, C‐reactive protein; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GGT, γ‐glutamyl transferase; hATTR‐CA, hereditary ATTR‐CA; IVSd, interventricular septal thickness in diastole; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; NAC, National Amyloidosis Centre; NT‐pro‐BNP, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide; PWTd, posterior wall thickness in diastole; RWT, relative wall thickness; TIA, transient ischemic attack; WBC, white blood cell; and wtATTR‐CA, wild‐type ATTR‐CA.

At diagnosis, blood biomarkers differed significantly between genotypes. Patients with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a significantly higher NT‐proBNP than patients with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (Table 1, Figure 1A). This was reflected in the NAC staging system, with patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA having the highest NAC stage, followed by those with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. The overwhelming majority of patients had an elevated troponin level (98.2%), and patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had the highest median troponin‐T level, followed by those with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA.

B, Blood biomarker abnormalities in patients with ATTR‐CA split by National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) disease stage. ALP indicates alkaline phosphatase; CRP, C‐reactive protein; hATTR‐CA, hereditary ATTR‐CA; and wtATTR‐CA, wild type ATTR‐CA.

Over one‐third (38.6%) of the patients were anemic, and anemia was most prevalent in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Anemic patients with wtATTR‐CA had a significantly higher median (interquartile range) hemoglobin level than anemic patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (124 [115–129] versus 121 [109–128] ng/L; P<0.001); and the prevalence of severe anemia (hemoglobin <10.0 g/L) was higher in those with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA than wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (22 [5.2%] versus 30 [1.6%] versus 2 [0.7%]; P<0.001).

Almost half (49.5%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 to 5, and 53.2% had a high urea level at diagnosis. CKD stage 3 to 5 was most prevalent in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, whereas a high urea was most prevalent in wtATTR‐CA.

Elevated cholestatic liver enzymes were also common (1812 [70.6%] had either an elevated γ‐glutamyl transferase or alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), with 69.8% having an increased γ‐glutamyl transferase and 16.4% having an increased ALP. This was more prevalent than transaminitis (elevated alanine transaminase or aspartate aminotransferase), which was present in only 271 (10.5%) patients. Those with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had significantly higher liver enzyme levels than those with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Synthetic liver function was also affected, with hyperbilirubinemia in 17.9% of patients and hypalbuminaemia in 1.5%, both of which were most prevalent in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Over one‐quarter (27.3%) had an increased serum CRP (C‐reactive protein) at diagnosis. Those with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a significantly higher CRP, and more commonly had an elevated CRP than those with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (Table 1, Table S2, Figure 1A).

Patients with a higher NAC disease stage at diagnosis had a higher prevalence of anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, deranged liver function test results, and an elevated CRP and troponin‐T. Most significant differences observed were between patients with stage 1 (mild) and patients with NAC stage 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) disease. However, there were some significant differences between patients with NAC stage 2 and stage 3 disease. Over half of the patients diagnosed with NAC stage 3 disease were anemic (56.7%), the overwhelming majority were uremic (94.4%), nearly one‐third had hyperbilirubinemia (32.1%), over one‐fifth had an elevated ALP (28.2%), and nearly half had an elevated CRP (Table 2, Table S3, Figure 1B).

Blood Biomarkers Split by NAC Disease Stage

Data are given as mean±SD, number (percentage), and median (interquartile range). P values for pairwise comparison: α=P<0.01 for NAC stage 1 vs NAC stage 2, β=P<0.01 NAC stage 1 vs NAC stage 3, γ=P<0.01 NAC stage 2 vs NAC stage 3.

CRP indicates C‐reactive protein; GGT, γ‐glutamyl transferase; IVSd, interventricular septal thickness in diastole; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; NAC, National Amyloidosis Centre; NT‐pro‐BNP, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide; PWTd, posterior wall thickness in diastole; RWT, relative wall thickness; and WBC, white blood cell.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was available in 2409 (93.9%) patients, most of whom were in NYHA class II (n=1531, 63.6%). Similar trends were observed when patients were split by NYHA class. Patients with a higher NYHA class at diagnosis had a higher prevalence of anemia, high urea, deranged liver function test results, and elevated CRP and troponin‐T. Most significant differences were observed between patients with NYHA functional class I to II and NYHA class III to IV. However, there were some significant differences between patients with NYHA functional class III and NYHA class IV. Patients with NYHA functional class IV had a lower hemoglobin, higher aspartate aminotransferase, higher prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, and higher CRP (Table S4).

When divided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patients with an LVEF ≤40% had a higher prevalence of high urea, CKD stage 3 to 5, hyperbilirubinemia, deranged liver function test results, and elevated CRP and troponin‐T, than patients with a LVEF >40% (Table S5).

Across the overall population, stroke volume had a weak negative correlation with serum urea, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, ALP, γ‐glutamyl transferase, CRP, and troponin‐T, and a weak positive correlation with serum albumin (Table S6). Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that stroke volume had an independent positive relationship with serum albumin, and an independent negative relationship with serum bilirubin (Table S7).

At median follow up of 37.1 months (interquartile range, 16.4–59.2 months), 966 (37.6%) patients had died, and the death rate was 12.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 12.0–13.6). There were 638 (34.8%) deaths in the wtATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 11.8 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 10.9–12.8), 228 (53.6%) in the p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 19.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 17.2–22.2), and 100 (32.6%) in the non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 9.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 7.9–11.8). Blood biomarkers first were explored in a univariable Cox regression analysis as continuous variables, z‐score standardized variables, and dichotomous variables, and all except for alanine transaminase were associated with mortality (Table S8). Following z‐score standardization, blood biomarkers were also investigated in a multivariable Cox regression analysis, and hemoglobin, serum sodium, urea, bilirubin, albumin, and troponin all remained independently associated with mortality (Table S9).

The association between blood biomarkers as dichotomous variables and mortality within individual NAC stages was further investigated. Within all 3 NAC disease subgroups, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, high ALP, high CRP, hyponatremia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were associated with mortality. However, anemia and high urea were associated with mortality in the subgroups with NAC stage 1 and NAC stage 2 disease, but not in those with NAC stage 3 disease. The likelihood ratio test demonstrated that each blood biomarker added a significant contribution to the NAC disease stage (anemia: χ2=16.92, P<0.001; hyperbilirubinemia: χ2=28.78, P<0.001; high urea: χ2=18.29, P<0.001; hypoalbuminemia: χ2=16.12, P<0.001; high ALP: χ2=26.81, P<0.001; high CRP: χ2=19.93, P<0.001; hyponatremia: χ2=15.62, P<0.001; troponin‐T >56 ng/L: χ2=88.67, P<0.001) (Figure 2).

ATTR‐CA indicates transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; and Hb, hemoglobin.

Blood biomarkers selected a priori based on clinical relevance were explored in a multivariable model that adjusted for known predictors of prognosis (age, NAC stage, and wtATTR‐CA or hATTR‐CA). This model confirmed that anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated ALP, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independent predictors of mortality; and all except for elevated ALP remained independent predictors when patients were censored at the start date of disease‐modifying therapy and enrollment into clinical trials (Table 3, Figure 3). Multivariable Cox regression models, adjusting for furosemide equivalent dose and stroke volume, confirmed that anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L all remained independently associated with mortality (Table S10).

ALP indicates alkaline phosphatase; CRP, C‐reactive protein; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GGT, γ‐glutamyl transferase; hATTR‐CA, hereditary ATTR‐CA; Hb, hemoglobin; HR, hazard ratio; Na, sodium; NAC, National Amyloidosis Centre; and NT‐proBNP, N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide.

The multivariable model was repeated in the prespecified subgroups of patients with an LVEF ≤40% and patients with an LVEF >40%. In patients with an LVEF ≤40%, anemia, hyponatremia, high ALP, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were all independently associated with mortality; whereas in patients with an LVEF >40%, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were all independently associated with mortality (Table S11).

A similar multivariable model was used in patients with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA separately. The model was not applied to non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA because of a low number of events. In wtATTR‐CA, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independently associated with mortality; whereas in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, only anemia and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independently associated with mortality (Table 4).

ALP indicates alkaline phosphatase; ATTR‐CA, transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis; CRP, C‐reactive protein; GGT, γ‐glutamyl transferase; hATTR‐CA, hereditary ATTR‐CA; HR, hazard ratio; NAC, National Amyloidosis Centre; and wtATTR‐CA, wild type ATTR‐CA.

Troponin‐T >56 ng/L was consistently an independent predictor of mortality throughout all the multivariable models. Patients with ATTR‐CA could be further divided into prognostic categories based on troponin‐T, and with every increase of 28 ng/L, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality (Figure 2).

### Blood Biomarkers and ATTR‐CA Genotype

At diagnosis, blood biomarkers differed significantly between genotypes. Patients with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a significantly higher NT‐proBNP than patients with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (Table 1, Figure 1A). This was reflected in the NAC staging system, with patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA having the highest NAC stage, followed by those with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. The overwhelming majority of patients had an elevated troponin level (98.2%), and patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had the highest median troponin‐T level, followed by those with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA.

B, Blood biomarker abnormalities in patients with ATTR‐CA split by National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) disease stage. ALP indicates alkaline phosphatase; CRP, C‐reactive protein; hATTR‐CA, hereditary ATTR‐CA; and wtATTR‐CA, wild type ATTR‐CA.

Over one‐third (38.6%) of the patients were anemic, and anemia was most prevalent in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Anemic patients with wtATTR‐CA had a significantly higher median (interquartile range) hemoglobin level than anemic patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (124 [115–129] versus 121 [109–128] ng/L; P<0.001); and the prevalence of severe anemia (hemoglobin <10.0 g/L) was higher in those with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA than wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (22 [5.2%] versus 30 [1.6%] versus 2 [0.7%]; P<0.001).

Almost half (49.5%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 to 5, and 53.2% had a high urea level at diagnosis. CKD stage 3 to 5 was most prevalent in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, whereas a high urea was most prevalent in wtATTR‐CA.

Elevated cholestatic liver enzymes were also common (1812 [70.6%] had either an elevated γ‐glutamyl transferase or alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), with 69.8% having an increased γ‐glutamyl transferase and 16.4% having an increased ALP. This was more prevalent than transaminitis (elevated alanine transaminase or aspartate aminotransferase), which was present in only 271 (10.5%) patients. Those with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had significantly higher liver enzyme levels than those with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Synthetic liver function was also affected, with hyperbilirubinemia in 17.9% of patients and hypalbuminaemia in 1.5%, both of which were most prevalent in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Over one‐quarter (27.3%) had an increased serum CRP (C‐reactive protein) at diagnosis. Those with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a significantly higher CRP, and more commonly had an elevated CRP than those with non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA (Table 1, Table S2, Figure 1A).

### Blood Biomarkers and Disease Severity

Patients with a higher NAC disease stage at diagnosis had a higher prevalence of anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, deranged liver function test results, and an elevated CRP and troponin‐T. Most significant differences observed were between patients with stage 1 (mild) and patients with NAC stage 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) disease. However, there were some significant differences between patients with NAC stage 2 and stage 3 disease. Over half of the patients diagnosed with NAC stage 3 disease were anemic (56.7%), the overwhelming majority were uremic (94.4%), nearly one‐third had hyperbilirubinemia (32.1%), over one‐fifth had an elevated ALP (28.2%), and nearly half had an elevated CRP (Table 2, Table S3, Figure 1B).

New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was available in 2409 (93.9%) patients, most of whom were in NYHA class II (n=1531, 63.6%). Similar trends were observed when patients were split by NYHA class. Patients with a higher NYHA class at diagnosis had a higher prevalence of anemia, high urea, deranged liver function test results, and elevated CRP and troponin‐T. Most significant differences were observed between patients with NYHA functional class I to II and NYHA class III to IV. However, there were some significant differences between patients with NYHA functional class III and NYHA class IV. Patients with NYHA functional class IV had a lower hemoglobin, higher aspartate aminotransferase, higher prevalence of hypoalbuminemia, and higher CRP (Table S4).

When divided by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), patients with an LVEF ≤40% had a higher prevalence of high urea, CKD stage 3 to 5, hyperbilirubinemia, deranged liver function test results, and elevated CRP and troponin‐T, than patients with a LVEF >40% (Table S5).

Across the overall population, stroke volume had a weak negative correlation with serum urea, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, ALP, γ‐glutamyl transferase, CRP, and troponin‐T, and a weak positive correlation with serum albumin (Table S6). Multivariable linear regression demonstrated that stroke volume had an independent positive relationship with serum albumin, and an independent negative relationship with serum bilirubin (Table S7).

### Survival

At median follow up of 37.1 months (interquartile range, 16.4–59.2 months), 966 (37.6%) patients had died, and the death rate was 12.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 12.0–13.6). There were 638 (34.8%) deaths in the wtATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 11.8 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 10.9–12.8), 228 (53.6%) in the p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 19.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 17.2–22.2), and 100 (32.6%) in the non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA group, with a death rate of 9.7 deaths per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 7.9–11.8). Blood biomarkers first were explored in a univariable Cox regression analysis as continuous variables, z‐score standardized variables, and dichotomous variables, and all except for alanine transaminase were associated with mortality (Table S8). Following z‐score standardization, blood biomarkers were also investigated in a multivariable Cox regression analysis, and hemoglobin, serum sodium, urea, bilirubin, albumin, and troponin all remained independently associated with mortality (Table S9).

The association between blood biomarkers as dichotomous variables and mortality within individual NAC stages was further investigated. Within all 3 NAC disease subgroups, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, high ALP, high CRP, hyponatremia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were associated with mortality. However, anemia and high urea were associated with mortality in the subgroups with NAC stage 1 and NAC stage 2 disease, but not in those with NAC stage 3 disease. The likelihood ratio test demonstrated that each blood biomarker added a significant contribution to the NAC disease stage (anemia: χ2=16.92, P<0.001; hyperbilirubinemia: χ2=28.78, P<0.001; high urea: χ2=18.29, P<0.001; hypoalbuminemia: χ2=16.12, P<0.001; high ALP: χ2=26.81, P<0.001; high CRP: χ2=19.93, P<0.001; hyponatremia: χ2=15.62, P<0.001; troponin‐T >56 ng/L: χ2=88.67, P<0.001) (Figure 2).

Blood biomarkers selected a priori based on clinical relevance were explored in a multivariable model that adjusted for known predictors of prognosis (age, NAC stage, and wtATTR‐CA or hATTR‐CA). This model confirmed that anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated ALP, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independent predictors of mortality; and all except for elevated ALP remained independent predictors when patients were censored at the start date of disease‐modifying therapy and enrollment into clinical trials (Table 3, Figure 3). Multivariable Cox regression models, adjusting for furosemide equivalent dose and stroke volume, confirmed that anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L all remained independently associated with mortality (Table S10).

The multivariable model was repeated in the prespecified subgroups of patients with an LVEF ≤40% and patients with an LVEF >40%. In patients with an LVEF ≤40%, anemia, hyponatremia, high ALP, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were all independently associated with mortality; whereas in patients with an LVEF >40%, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were all independently associated with mortality (Table S11).

A similar multivariable model was used in patients with wtATTR‐CA and p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA separately. The model was not applied to non‐p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA because of a low number of events. In wtATTR‐CA, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independently associated with mortality; whereas in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, only anemia and troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independently associated with mortality (Table 4).

Troponin‐T >56 ng/L was consistently an independent predictor of mortality throughout all the multivariable models. Patients with ATTR‐CA could be further divided into prognostic categories based on troponin‐T, and with every increase of 28 ng/L, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality (Figure 2).

### Discussion

This study comprehensively evaluated the multifaceted nature of ATTR‐CA using a wide range of cardiac and noncardiac blood biomarker profiles, and assessed the association between blood biomarkers and mortality. Our study demonstrated that: (1) ATTR‐CA is a complex and multisystemic disease process that commonly presents with a range of cardiac and noncardiac blood biomarker abnormalities; (2) blood biomarker abnormalities are most prevalent in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA, and become more prevalent as the cardiac disease severity increases; and (3) noncardiac blood biomarkers are associated with mortality, anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased ALP, remaining independently associated with mortality after adjusting for troponin‐T, NT‐proBNP, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. This highlights the importance of multisystemic disease in ATTR‐CA, whereby multiple pathways involving different organs and systems, beyond cardiac infiltration, contribute to disease progression and prognosis (Figure 3).

HF is increasingly recognized as a multifaceted disease process. The underlying pathophysiology is more complex than can be explained by the simple concept of pump failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that multiple hematological, biochemical, and inflammatory homeostatic pathways are influenced by the deterioration of cardiac function.6–

 Anemia, congestive hepatopathy, and systemic inflammation have emerged as common comorbidities that independently predict outcomes in patients with HF.

 The same is true for the population with ATTR‐CA, with over one‐third of patients being anemic, over two‐thirds having elevated cholestatic enzymes, and over one‐quarter having an elevated CRP at diagnosis.

The pattern and prevalence of biomarker abnormalities varies between genotypes. Patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a higher prevalence of anemia, deranged liver function, and a higher troponin than those with wtATTR‐CA and non‐p.(V142I) hATTR. Patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had more advanced cardiac disease at diagnosis, and the prevalence of biomarker abnormalities increased as the severity of cardiac disease increased, as evidenced by NAC disease stage, NYHA class, and LVEF. Therefore, the higher prevalence of biomarker abnormalities in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA likely reflects more advanced cardiac disease at diagnosis. However, these observations could also relate to different demographics between genotypes. The overwhelming majority of patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA were Afro‐Caribbean, and a greater proportion were women, compared with those with wtATTR‐CA, both of which have previously been associated with anemia in patients with HF.

12
 This may have been compounded by the greater prevalence of CKD in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Interestingly, patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA had a higher troponin‐T, more severe degree of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, but similar NT‐proBNP to wtATTR‐CA. This could reflect a greater degree of ongoing myocyte damage as a consequence of intrinsic differences in disease biology, with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA being associated with a more rapidly progressive disease. However, the relatively lower NT‐proBNP elevation in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA could also reflect racial differences in natriuretic peptide synthesis and excretion, with Afro‐Caribbean patients being known to have lower NT‐proBNP levels.
13
 The p.(V142I) genotype was also associated with increased left ventricular filling pressures, and is known to cause a disproportionally greater degree of right ventricular systolic dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation.
14
 The resulting increased hepatic congestion is likely to account for the increased prevalence of cholestasis in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA. Hypoalbuminemia has been also associated with hemodilution, inflammation, malnutrition, and cachexia in HF.
15
 Within the population with hATTR‐CA, albumin levels are influenced by the presence of concomitant polyneuropathy, and more specifically autonomic neuropathy, which results in impaired gastrointestinal motility and malabsorption.
16
 This is reflected in our population, with patients with hATTR‐CA having a lower serum total protein and lower albumin than those with wtATTR‐CA, and further illustrates the complexity of this multisystemic disease process.

In the current study, which represents the largest study of blood biomarkers in ATTR‐CA to date, anemia, hyponatremia, high urea, hyperbilirubinemia, and troponin‐T >56 ng/L were all independently associated with mortality, after adjusting for NT‐proBNP and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Throughout the spectrum of genotypes and LVEF, troponin‐T >56 ng/L remained independently associated with mortality. This is likely to reflect the importance of ongoing myocyte death resulting from constant amyloid fibril accumulation, and demonstrates the importance of troponin‐T measurements in stratifying prognosis and identifying high‐risk patients.
17
 However, the prognostic impact of noncardiac biomarkers varied across the spectrum of genotypes and LVEF. Anemia was associated with mortality in p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA across the spectrum of LVEF and the subgroup of patients with an LVEF ≤40% from the overall population; but not in the subgroups of wtATTR‐CA and patients with an LVEF >40%. The difference in prognostic impact is possibly attributable to differences in genotype characteristics and disease severity. First, p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA was not only more commonly associated with anemia (likely because of the higher prevalence of female and Afro‐Caribbean patients) but was also associated with more severe anemia than wtATTR‐CA (possibly because of the higher prevalence of CKD). Second, p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA accounted for a greater proportion of patients with an LVEF ≤40% than patients with an LVEF >40%. In patients with ATTR‐CA, anemia was only independently associated with mortality in the subgroup with a LVEF ≤40%, and this is consistent with previous studies of patients with HF that demonstrated a greater prognostic importance of anemia in patients with a reduced LVEF.

 Iron‐deficiency anemia not only represents a common comorbidity in HF, but has emerged as a modifiable treatment target, with restoration of iron levels resulting in improved functional capacity and prognosis in the Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure and Effectiveness of Intravenous Iron Treatment versus Standard Care in Patients with Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency trials.

20
 Currently, tafamidis (a highly specific transthyretin stabilizer) is the only treatment proven to improve prognosis in ATTR‐CA, but despite efficacy, the associated high cost has resulted in restricted use.
21
, 
22
 Analysis of HF medications in ATTR‐CA demonstrated that neurohormonal modulation through mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and low‐dose β‐blockers in patients with an LVEF ≤40% was associated with improved survival; and suggests ATTR‐CA may share similar pathophysiological mechanisms to HF of different causes.
23
 Considering these findings alongside data demonstrating the independent association between anemia and mortality, it is plausible that correction of anemia in ATTR‐CA could improve outcomes, especially in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA or patients with an LVEF ≤40%. However, the correction of anemia as a possible modifiable risk factor has not been featured in the recent consensus documents by the European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology for the treatment ATTR‐CA.
24
, 
25
 Although the analysis reported here has limitations, the observations do raise the question as to whether there could be some benefit from correcting anemia, and therefore this should be explored as a potential treatment option in prospective randomized controlled clinical trials.

As a retrospective study, we have been able to demonstrate the association between biomarkers and mortality, but are unable to prove causality. All‐cause mortality was obtained from a national database, but data on cardiovascular mortality were not available in all patients. Differences between genotypes could reflect a different propensity to seek medical attention and different referral practices across populations. However, this is likely to be partially mitigated by the free nature of the National Health Service at the point of care, and hence, the decision to seek medical attention is less likely to be influenced by socioeconomic status.

### Conclusions

In this large cohort of patients with ATTR‐CA, both cardiac and noncardiac blood biomarker abnormalities were common and were more prevalent in patients with p.(V142I) hATTR‐CA and advanced cardiac disease. The wide range of abnormalities reflects the complex and multifaceted nature of ATTR‐CA and highlights the importance of multisystemic disease, whereby multiple pathways involving different organs and systems, beyond cardiac infiltration, contribute to disease progression and prognosis. Whether treatment aimed at restoring hemoglobin levels in this population would potentially reduce the risk of mortality remains unknown. Therefore, clinical trials are needed to investigate whether biomarker abnormalities represent modifiable risk factors that if specifically targeted could improve outcomes.
