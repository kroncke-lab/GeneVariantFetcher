## Association of the V122I Transthyretin Amyloidosis Genetic Variant With Cardiac Structure and Function in Middle-aged Black Adults

### Abstract

Key PointsQuestionIs there an association between the common transthyretin (TTR) genetic variant V122I and adverse cardiac mechanics among middle-aged Black adults without symptomatic heart failure?FindingsIn this population-based cohort study of 875 Black adults, there was a significant association of the TTR V122I variant with worse left ventricular structure and cardiac mechanics at a mean age of 54 years.MeaningIn Black middle-aged adults with the TTR V122I variant, earlier screening with echocardiography may inform use of novel therapies targeting TTR amyloid deposition and intensification of risk factor modification to prevent or postpone heart failure, and this option should be studied.
