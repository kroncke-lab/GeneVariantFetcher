## The short and long‐term characteristics and outcomes of patients with grade 1 myocardial uptake on cardiac scintigraphy

### Abstract

AbstractAimsThis study aimed to characterize the final diagnosis and prognosis of patients with grade 1 myocardial scintigraphy uptake, which is an unequivocal result for the diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR‐CA) requiring further invasive investigation with tissue biopsy.Methods and resultsWe retrospectively compared the clinical and imaging parameters of patients suspected for ATTR‐CA (based on clinical and echocardiographic parameters) with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 technetium pyrophosphate uptake on cardiac scintigraphy. Prospectively, grade 1 patients underwent re‐evaluation for ATTR‐CA at long term. Of the 132 ATTR‐CA suspected patients, 89 (67%) were diagnosed as grade 1 and 43 (33%) as grades 2/3 uptake. Grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 patients were younger and female predominant with lower biomarker levels and left ventricular mass. Based on available imaging and pathology findings, only 6 out of the 89 patients with grade 1 uptake (7%) were finally diagnosed with light‐chain cardiac amyloidosis, whereas no patient was diagnosed with ATTR‐CA. At 2 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.75, 3.25] years of follow‐up, the survival of patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake was significantly better [hazard ratio 0.271 (95% confidence interval 0.130 to 0.563, P = 0.0005)]. Prospectively, 30 patients with grade 1 uptake were re‐evaluated at a median follow‐up of 3.2 (IQR 2.2, 3.9) years. Their New York Heart Association class, biomarker levels, and echocardiography findings remained stable. No patient (0/25) demonstrated grades 2/3 uptake at repeated long‐term scintigraphy.ConclusionsPatients with suspected ATTR‐CA and a grade 1 scintigraphy uptake demonstrate a stable clinical, laboratory, imaging, and scintigraphy phenotype along with a benign survival profile at long‐term follow‐up. Larger studies should define the optimal evaluation strategy in this population.

### Introduction

A significant progress has been made over the last decade in the diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR‐CA). A non‐invasive myocardial scintigraphy study using bone avid tracers [such as 99mTc‐labelled pyrophosphate (99mTc‐PYP)] has become the standard test for the diagnosis of ATTR‐CA.

 This modality uses simple four‐stage grading system that is based on the intensity of tracer uptake in the myocardium relative to that in the bones (Perugini grade scores 0–3).
3
 Following the exclusion of light‐chain monoclonality by blood and urine tests and the exclusion of tracer uptake in the blood pool by single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the specificity and positive predicting values of grade 2 or grade 3 uptake scores for ATTR‐CA are reaching 100%.

 Accordingly, the recently published European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Guidelines defined both grade 2 and grade 3 scores as compatible with the diagnosis of ATTR‐CA, obviating the need for an invasive endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).

 In contrast, a grade 1 uptake score does not establish the diagnosis of ATTR‐CA and, according to current diagnostic algorithms, requires further investigation by tissue biopsy,

 preferably EMB due to diagnostic yield considerations.

 Limited scientific data exist regarding the characteristics, endpoint diagnoses, and the long‐term clinical, imaging, and scintigraphy parameters of patients with grade 1 myocardial uptake.

Therefore, we aimed to describe the baseline characteristics, final clinical diagnoses and prognosis of patients with suspected ATTR‐CA, and a result of grade 1 uptake in comparison with grade 2 or 3 myocardial uptake. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the long‐term clinical and imaging findings in a group of patients with baseline grade 1 uptake.

### Methods

The population of the study was composed of a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent a 99mTc‐PYP cardiac scintigraphy study for the suspected diagnosis of ATTR‐CA between February 2017 and July 2022 at our institution (anonymous). Cardiac scintigraphy scans were interoperated by nuclear cardiologists blinded to clinical data with an expertise in the field of cardiac amyloid imaging. Patients with a negative result for ATTR‐CA (grade 0 uptake)
10
 were excluded.

The study design was two‐fold (Figure 
1
): First, we retrospectively characterized the baseline clinical parameters, the endpoint diagnoses, and the long‐term overall survival of patients with clinically and/or echocardiographically suspected ATTR‐CA who were referred for cardiac scintigraphy, stratified by their tracer uptake grade. Patients with grade 2 and grade 3 uptake were grouped together as both scores are considered compatible with the diagnosis of ATTR‐CA.

 Patients' electronic medical records, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations were reviewed. Second, for the long‐term evaluation of patients with grade 1 uptake, alive patients with a minimal time of 2 years from baseline scintigraphy scan were prospectively invited by a telephone call to attend the cardiac amyloidosis clinic at our institution for a re‐assessment of amyloid cardiomyopathy. Patients who declined to attend the clinic were questioned by a medical provider about heart failure symptoms or related hospitalizations and their electronic medical records were reviewed. The visit included a routine medical history taking, amyloid‐focused physical examination, and the acquisition of an electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers [high‐sensitivity troponin T and N‐terminal pro‐hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP)]. Patients who gave their consent were also genetically tested for mutations in the TTR gene. Patients then underwent a repeat echocardiogram and a cardiac scintigraphy scan with myocardial tracer uptake analysis.

The diagnostic criteria of ATTR‐CA have been previously described.
11
 Cardiac ATTR was defined as the combination of symptoms with an echocardiogram consistent with CA and a grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake on 99mTc‐PYP scintigraphy in the absence of a monoclonal gammopathy,
1
 or a histological diagnosis that was based on Congo‐red staining from myocardial tissue and protein analysis consistent with ATTR. Following a histological or non‐invasive diagnosis of ATTR, patients who gave their specified consent were referred to TTR genetic testing to differentiate between mutant ATTR and wild‐type ATTR. Light‐chain monoclonality analysis included serum free light chains, serum protein immunofixation, and urine Bence‐Jones. The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was according to consensus criteria and required to prove the presence of amyloid deposition in tissue biopsy by Congo‐red staining.
12
, 
13
 Protein analysis confirming amyloid type deposits was made by immunohistochemistry.
14
 Mass spectrometry proteomic analysis was undertaken in selected cases.

The left atrial and ventricular diameters and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured according to accepted guidelines.
15
 The global longitudinal strain (GLS) was acquired solely with a single vendor (Philips) using the latest software moderated from the TomTec platform. Three apical views are obtained, namely, the four‐chamber, two‐chamber, and three‐chamber views at a minimal frame rate of 60 frames/s. GLS was calculated automatically by the software unless the endocardial border set by the software was mal‐aligned, then it was corrected manually. Relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as 2 times LV posterior wall (PW) diastolic thickness divided by LV diastolic diameter.
15
 LV mass was calculated according to the Devereux formula.
16
 The pulmonary artery systolic pressure was estimated from the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet and estimated right atrial pressure based on inferior vena cava diameter and distensibility.
17
 LV diastolic function was assessed by integrating mitral flow pattern, tissue Doppler imaging, indexed left atrial volume, and systolic pulmonary pressure.
18
 Cut‐off values for defining abnormalities in the reported echocardiographic variables were chosen according to published reference guidelines in the general population.

The indexed LV mass–voltage ratio was defined as echocardiography‐derived LV mass indexed to body surface area divided by the Cornell voltage. The Cornell voltage, previously found to correlate with heart failure hospitalizations and mortality in patients with cardiac amyloidosis,
23
 was measured as the sum of the S‐wave in lead V3 and the R‐wave in lead aVL.

CMR imaging was performed using 1.5 T scanner (Ingenia; Philips Medical System) implementing standardized imaging protocols. CMR protocol included multiplanar cine imaging for the acquisition of cardiac function, volumes, and mass, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging for scar imaging. Balanced steady state free precession, single breath‐hold modified inversion recovery Look‐Locker (MOLLI) was used for T1 mapping. Native T1 mapping was acquired in a three short‐axis slices (apical, mid‐ventricular, and basal). Abnormal T1 values were defined as 
≥ 1060 ms.
24
 For data analysis, the complete dataset was transmitted to a dedicated CMR workstation (Philips IntelliSpace Portal, Version 11.0). Cardiac volumes, function, and mass were measured using automated contour detection with manual correction if required.

Planar imaging with 99mTc‐PYP was performed with a dedicated cardiac Ventri system (GE Healthcare, Haifa, Israel). Patients received 20 mCi of 99mTc‐PYP intravenously and anterior and lateral views were obtained at 1 and 3 h over 8 min duration. The planar images were acquired for a total of 750 000 counts, with the heart centred in the field of view. The acquisition parameters used for planar imaging were 256 × 256 matrix with 1.46 zoom factor. SPECT imaging was performed when myocardial uptake of 99mTc‐PYP was evident on planar images; that is, all patients with grades 1, 2, and 3 uptake underwent SPECT imaging at 1 and 3 h. For image interpretation, the anterior and lateral planar images, as well as the rotating projection images and reconstructed SPECT images, were reviewed. We used two approaches to quantify 99mTc‐PYP uptake: (1) semiquantitative visual scoring method, cardiac 99mTc‐PYP uptake in relation to bone uptake (0 = no cardiac uptake; 1 = mild uptake, less than bone; 2 = moderate uptake, equal to bone; 3 = high uptake, greater than bone) and (2) quantitative myocardial to contralateral lung ratio of uptake (H/CL), which was calculated by drawing a region of interest (ROI) over the heart. The ROI was copied and mirrored over the contralateral chest to normalize for the spillover from the ribs. Mean total and absolute counts were measured correcting for background counts, and the fraction of mean counts in the heart (H) ROI‐to‐contralateral (CL) chest ROI was calculated as the H/CL ratio. Inter‐observer and intra‐observer variability for H/CL ratio was 0.005 ± 0.07 [95% confidence interval (CI) −0.135 to 0.145] and 0.004 ± 0.07 (95% CI −0.136 to 0.144), respectively. The interclass correlation coefficient for H/L ratio was 0.81 and 0.83 for inter‐observer and intra‐observer measurements.

After obtaining informed consent, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of patients. A sanger sequencing of the four exons of the TTR gene was performed at the Molecular Genetics Laboratory of the Recanati Genetic Institute of Rabin Medical Center. The variant classification and interpretation were based on the accepted American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria.

All‐cause mortality during follow‐up was determined for all patients through the Israeli National Population Registry. Informed consent was given for genetic TTR testing. The study protocol was approved by the Rabin Medical Center Institutional Review Board.

The statistical analysis was carried out using SAS Statistical Software, Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile 25th, 75th range. Categorical variables were presented as N (%). T‐test was used to compare the values of continuous variables, displaying normal distribution between study groups, and the Wilcoxon test was used for non‐Gaussian distributions. The signed‐rank test was used for paired differences, as the variables were skewed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the values of categorical variables. Inter‐observer and intra‐observer variability for H/CL ratio was tested in 40 randomly selected study subjects according to the Bland and Altman method. In addition, intraclass correlation coefficient was determined. Overall survival was defined as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause. Survival curve during the study follow‐up was assessed by the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, with the log‐rank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs). Two‐sided P‐values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Results

The study population included 132 consecutive patients who were referred for cardiac scintigraphy for the investigation of ATTR‐CA. As shown in Table

1
, all patients had heart failure symptoms and/or echocardiographic features compatible with amyloid cardiomyopathy as a referral indication. Based on myocardial uptake findings, 89, 21, and 22 patients were diagnosed with grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 scores, respectively.

The baseline characteristics of patients with grade 1 uptake vs. patients with grade 2 and grade 3 uptake are presented in Table

1
. Patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake were younger {75 [interquartile range (IQR) 70, 83] years vs. 82 [IQR 75, 87] years, respectively, P = 0.003} and more likely to be female (51% vs. 9%, P = 0.001) with lower cardiac biomarker levels [troponin T: 22 (IQR 15, 44) ng/L vs. 61 (49, 93) ng/L, respectively, P < 0.001; and NT‐proBNP: 1253 (487, 3802) pg/mL vs. 3664 (1214, 6153) pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.003] and a lower incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome (17% vs. 53%, respectively, P < 0.001). Cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease were comparable between grade 1 and grades 2/3 patients, yet diabetes mellitus was more prevalent among grade 1 patients. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was similar between groups with the majority of patients (85%) presenting with NYHA functional class 2 or 3. Echocardiography revelated significantly thinner LV walls [intraventricular septum of 12 (IQR 10, 14) vs. 17 (IQR 14, 19), P < 0.001], lower LV mass index [103 (IQR 88, 142) vs. 159 (IQR 129, 203), P < 0.001], and better LV diastolic function (56% vs. 96% with grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction, P < 0.001) among patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake. Moreover, biventricular systolic function was better in patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake [LVEF: 60 (IQR 50, 60) % vs. 50 (40, 55) %, P < 0.001; and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE): 17 (17, 19) mm vs. 15 (13, 18) mm, P = 0.005]. Cardiac scintigraphy scan demonstrated a lower H/CL ratio in patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake [1.27 (IQR 1.20, 1.36) vs. 1.70 (1.6, 2.0), respectively, P < 0.001]. As presented in Supporting Information, Table

S1
, a higher myocardial uptake grade was associated with an incremental increase in NT‐proBNP levels and diastolic and systolic LV dysfunction. No differences were observed in the above parameters in patients with grade 2 vs. grade 3 uptake.

The long‐term survival [a median of 24 (IQR 9, 39) months] of patients with grade 1 uptake was significantly higher compared with patients with grades 2/3 uptake [HR 0.271 (95% CI 0.130 to 0.563, P = 0.0005)] (Figure

).

Along with cardiac scintigraphy, the majority of patients with grade 1 uptake were referred by their caring physician for further work‐up for the evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis or other cardiomyopathies. We retrospectively reviewed available diagnostic work‐up findings (Figure 
1
) from echocardiography studies (n = 89), blood and urine light‐chain monoclonality assays (n = 60), endomyocardial (n = 2) and bone marrow (n = 21) biopsies, and CMR studies (n = 48) (Table 
2
). Based on the above, patients' endpoint diagnoses are presented in Figure

3
. Out of the 89 patients with grade 1 uptake, 6 patients (7%) were diagnosed with light‐chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL‐CA) and 1 patient (1%) was diagnosed with inflammatory amyloidosis (AA) without heart involvement. Other plasma cell dyscrasias diagnoses were monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (n = 6) and multiple myeloma (n = 3). Echocardiography demonstrated severe mitral annulus calcification in 14 patients and 
≥ moderate aortic stenosis in 13 patients. To note, no patient was diagnosed with ATTR‐CA. Nineteen patients had no underlying cardiac pathology or major systemic illness, 58% of which (n = 11) completed CMR imaging that revealed normal cardiac findings. Representative CMR images are presented in Supporting Information, Figure

Native T1 values were available in 29 patients with grade 1 uptake and 14 patients with grades 2/3 uptake.

All alive patients with baseline grade 1 uptake and 
≥ 2 years of follow‐up (n = 56) were invited for a repeat evaluation in our dedicated cardiac amyloidosis clinic (Figure 
1
). The follow‐up [median of 3.2 (IQR 2.2, 3.9) years] vs. baseline parameters of 30 patients who gave their consent for re‐evaluation are presented in Table

3
. We found that in patients with grade 1 uptake, the NYHA functional class, cardiac biomarker levels, and echocardiography findings were comparable at baseline vs. follow‐up. Moreover, out of the 25 patients with baseline grade 1 uptake who repeated cardiac scintigraphy, no patient demonstrated grade 2 or 3 uptake at long‐term repeated scintigraphy. Ten patients completed CMR studies at follow‐up, with no evidence of cardiac amyloidosis based on the absence of amyloid‐compatible LGE patterns. Two out of the 10 patients had abnormal T1 value (observed in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in a kidney‐transplanted patient with hypertensive cardiomyopathy). Genetic testing for TTR gene mutations, aiming to identify false negative ATTR‐CA cases, was performed in 17 patients, who gave their consent for testing, and revealed a p.Val142Ile mutation for ATTR in a single patient who was also a carrier for a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the TNNI3 gene and a variant of unknown significance in the MYBPC3 gene. This patient was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on his clinical presentation and CMR findings.

Patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake were younger {75 [interquartile range (IQR) 70, 83] years vs. 82 [IQR 75, 87] years, respectively, P = 0.003} and more likely to be female (51% vs. 9%, P = 0.001) with lower cardiac biomarker levels [troponin T: 22 (IQR 15, 44) ng/L vs. 61 (49, 93) ng/L, respectively, P < 0.001; and NT‐proBNP: 1253 (487, 3802) pg/mL vs. 3664 (1214, 6153) pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.003] and a lower incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome (17% vs. 53%, respectively, P < 0.001). Cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease were comparable between grade 1 and grades 2/3 patients, yet diabetes mellitus was more prevalent among grade 1 patients. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was similar between groups with the majority of patients (85%) presenting with NYHA functional class 2 or 3. Echocardiography revelated significantly thinner LV walls [intraventricular septum of 12 (IQR 10, 14) vs. 17 (IQR 14, 19), P < 0.001], lower LV mass index [103 (IQR 88, 142) vs. 159 (IQR 129, 203), P < 0.001], and better LV diastolic function (56% vs. 96% with grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction, P < 0.001) among patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake. Moreover, biventricular systolic function was better in patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake [LVEF: 60 (IQR 50, 60) % vs. 50 (40, 55) %, P < 0.001; and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE): 17 (17, 19) mm vs. 15 (13, 18) mm, P = 0.005]. Cardiac scintigraphy scan demonstrated a lower H/CL ratio in patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake [1.27 (IQR 1.20, 1.36) vs. 1.70 (1.6, 2.0), respectively, P < 0.001]. As presented in Supporting Information, Table

S1
, a higher myocardial uptake grade was associated with an incremental increase in NT‐proBNP levels and diastolic and systolic LV dysfunction. No differences were observed in the above parameters in patients with grade 2 vs. grade 3 uptake.

The long‐term survival [a median of 24 (IQR 9, 39) months] of patients with grade 1 uptake was significantly higher compared with patients with grades 2/3 uptake [HR 0.271 (95% CI 0.130 to 0.563, P = 0.0005)] (Figure

### Diagnostic evaluation of patients with grade 1 uptake

Along with cardiac scintigraphy, the majority of patients with grade 1 uptake were referred by their caring physician for further work‐up for the evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis or other cardiomyopathies. We retrospectively reviewed available diagnostic work‐up findings (Figure

) from echocardiography studies (n = 89), blood and urine light‐chain monoclonality assays (n = 60), endomyocardial (n = 2) and bone marrow (n = 21) biopsies, and CMR studies (n = 48) (Table 
2
). Based on the above, patients' endpoint diagnoses are presented in Figure

3
. Out of the 89 patients with grade 1 uptake, 6 patients (7%) were diagnosed with light‐chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL‐CA) and 1 patient (1%) was diagnosed with inflammatory amyloidosis (AA) without heart involvement. Other plasma cell dyscrasias diagnoses were monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) (n = 6) and multiple myeloma (n = 3). Echocardiography demonstrated severe mitral annulus calcification in 14 patients and 
≥ moderate aortic stenosis in 13 patients. To note, no patient was diagnosed with ATTR‐CA. Nineteen patients had no underlying cardiac pathology or major systemic illness, 58% of which (n = 11) completed CMR imaging that revealed normal cardiac findings. Representative CMR images are presented in Supporting Information, Figure

### Long‐term evaluation of patients with grade 1 uptake

All alive patients with baseline grade 1 uptake and 
≥ 2 years of follow‐up (n = 56) were invited for a repeat evaluation in our dedicated cardiac amyloidosis clinic (Figure 
1
). The follow‐up [median of 3.2 (IQR 2.2, 3.9) years] vs. baseline parameters of 30 patients who gave their consent for re‐evaluation are presented in Table

3
. We found that in patients with grade 1 uptake, the NYHA functional class, cardiac biomarker levels, and echocardiography findings were comparable at baseline vs. follow‐up. Moreover, out of the 25 patients with baseline grade 1 uptake who repeated cardiac scintigraphy, no patient demonstrated grade 2 or 3 uptake at long‐term repeated scintigraphy. Ten patients completed CMR studies at follow‐up, with no evidence of cardiac amyloidosis based on the absence of amyloid‐compatible LGE patterns. Two out of the 10 patients had abnormal T1 value (observed in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in a kidney‐transplanted patient with hypertensive cardiomyopathy). Genetic testing for TTR gene mutations, aiming to identify false negative ATTR‐CA cases, was performed in 17 patients, who gave their consent for testing, and revealed a p.Val142Ile mutation for ATTR in a single patient who was also a carrier for a homozygous pathogenic mutation in the TNNI3 gene and a variant of unknown significance in the MYBPC3 gene. This patient was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on his clinical presentation and CMR findings.

### Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively evaluated the clinical and imaging characteristics and the long‐term scintigraphy findings of patients with clinically suspected ATTR‐CA who demonstrate an equivocal myocardial scintigraphy uptake (grade 1). In this cohort of consecutive cardiac scintigraphy referrals, patients with grade 1 uptake, in the absence of light‐chain monoclonality, did not reveal the characteristic phenotype of cardiac amyloidosis by CMR‐LGE and T1 mapping analysis, demonstrated stable laboratory, echocardiography, and scintigraphy parameters at a median of 3.2 years of follow‐up, and had significantly better overall survival compared with patients with grade 2 or 3 uptake. Moreover, following laboratory, pathology, and cardiac imaging evaluation, cardiac amyloidosis was evident in patients with grade 1 uptake only in the presence of plasma cell monoclonality and in the form of light‐chain amyloidosis.

Recently, Nitsche and colleagues have reported comparable long‐term overall survival between patients with grade 1 uptake and those with grade 0 uptake.
25
 The long‐term laboratory, imaging, and scintigraphy data described in our study complete the missing parts of the puzzle and add important evidence to support a benign natural history in patients with a grade 1 scintigraphy uptake. Although the natural progression of early stage ATTR‐CA has not been fully elucidated, accumulated evidence suggests that a progression in the clinical and imaging parameters over a median period of 3.2 years in a cohort of patients who have already displayed heart failure symptoms and/or echocardiographic findings compatible with amyloid cardiomyopathy would have been expected. This timeline is supported by the recently published study by Law and colleagues
26
 who showed that hereditary stage Ia ATTR‐CA subjects demonstrate disease progression (evidenced by worsening NYHA class and NT‐proBNP levels) over a median follow‐up of 28 months and by the work of Rettl and colleagues who reported a progressive deterioration in amyloid cardiomyopathy as imaged by CMR at a median follow‐up of 9 months in treatment‐naïve ATTR‐CA patients.
27
 We have also previously demonstrated an echocardiographic timeline of a 1–3 lag period between the abnormally thickening of the LV walls and the appearance of diastolic dysfunction to the development of amyloid‐related overt heart failure.
11

Cardiac scintigraphy has become the standard diagnostic modality for ATTR‐CA,
2
, 
7
, 
10
 allowing in the majority of cases for a non‐invasive and accurate diagnosis of a progressive yet now treatable cardiomyopathy. The use of cardiac scintigraphy has greatly contributed to the rise in ATTR‐CA diagnoses,
28
 because compared to traditional EMB, it permits a faster, safer, and more accessible diagnostic algorithm in a relatively elderly and comorbid population. Nevertheless, the contemporary changing paradigms in the referral of patients for the evaluation of ATTR‐CA have several clinical implications that were demonstrated in this study and should further be discussed. First, we observed a relatively higher proportion of patients with grade 1 vs. grades 2/3 uptake in our cardiac scintigraphy cohort. Second, among the population of patients with grade 1 uptake, no ATTR‐CA cases were subsequently diagnosed on both short‐term and long‐term follow‐ups.

While pivotal cardiac scintigraphy studies included selected referral cohorts with a high disease prevalence,
1
, 
29
, 
30
 hence with a high pre‐test probability for ATTR‐CA, in broader, real‐world screening populations where disease prevalence is lower, such as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and milder LV wall thickness, a decline in the positive predictive value of cardiac scintigraphy is to be expected (from 96% to 62.1%
31
). A lower positive predictive value is all the more probable in scans with subtle cardiac tracer uptake such as with grade 1 myocardial uptake. In a study that evaluated 69 patients with EMB‐proven ATTR‐CA, only 4 patients (6%) had grade 1 uptake on cardiac scintigraphy, whereas 94% of patients presented with grades 2 or 3 uptake.
29
 In a different analysis that evaluated tissue biopsies in 49 patients with grade 0 or 1 uptake, 9 were found with amyloid deposition, of which 7 were with AL amyloidosis and 2 were with inflammatory amyloidosis.
30
 Only one patient was diagnosed with mutant ATTR yet with no myocardial involvement on biopsy.

Moreover, along with AL‐CA, which is a well‐recognized aetiology for ‘non‐ATTR‐CA positive scintigraphy’, published data in the last several years have shown that blood pooling, rib fractures, myocardial infarction, and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity are other possible causes for non‐ATTR‐CA positive cardiac scintigraphy,
32
 and it is likely that this list will continue to grow as the use of cardiac scintigraphy becomes widespread. Common diagnoses in our cohort of patients with grade 1 uptake were hypertensive cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, prior myocardial infarction, and significantly calcified mitral annulus. Marume and colleagues reported that almost half of patients with grade 0 or 1 uptake had an underlying clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis.
30
 Although the high prevalence of aetiologies that cause increased LV wall thickness in patients with grade 1 uptake most probably results from a referral bias, the presence of myocardial scintigraphy uptake associated with the above entities deserves further investigation in order to better define false positive scenarios.

The major clinical implication of this study is in the evaluation of patients with grade 1 uptake. Current diagnostic algorithms for cardiac amyloidosis recommend that in patients who are diagnosed with grade 1 uptake, a tissue biopsy, preferably EMB, should be undertaken for further investigation.
6
, 
7
 This recommendation is based on the hypothesis that a result of grade 1 myocardial uptake reflects an early stage in the progressive infiltrative process of ATTR‐CA. However, in light of the invasive nature and the risk of fatal complications in performing an EMB, particularly in the elderly population of suspected ATTR‐CA patients, we believe that the very low rate of true positive ATTR‐CA in real‐world referral screening populations does not outweigh the risk of performing an EMB for every patient with grade 1 uptake. We suggest that the investigation of patients with suspected ATTR‐CA and unequivocal grade 1 result should incorporate multi‐modality assessment tools such as CMR
33
, 
34
 and positron emission tomography (PET)
35
 and possible transthyretin levels in carriers of TTR gene mutations.
36
 EMB should be reserved to very highly clinically suspected patients with grade 1 uptake and in centres with a high expertise in performing EMBs.

This study has several limitations. First, in the retrospective cohort, 38 patients with grade 1 uptake (43%) did not undergo CMR or EMB for the evaluation of amyloid cardiomyopathy, thus possibly biasing our results. However, the baseline characteristics of patients who completed vs. not completed further CMR/EMB evaluation were mostly similar (Supporting Information, Table

S2
 and Figure

S2
), including patients' referral indications for cardiac scintigraphy, echocardiography findings, cardiac biomarker levels, and overall survival. Moreover, H/CL was lower in patients who have not completed CMR/EMB. We believe these data support the lack of selection bias in our cohort because patients not referred vs. referred to CMR/EMB had similar amyloid‐related clinical and imaging findings yet were most probably refrained from further testing due to their advanced age, general frailty status, and/or CMR incompatibility related to their cardiac electronic device. Second, the prevalence of patients with mutant ATTR in Israel and in this cohort is low, and thus, our observations may not accurately reflect the diagnostic yield in other countries. Third, CMR is not considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of CA, and EMB was not pursued in the majority of patients. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of CMR‐LGE for CA is high (85–90%
10
), and contemporary CMR studies including both LGE and T1 mapping analysis demonstrated 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity for the diagnosis of CA.
33
, 
34
 Moreover, given the subtle myocardial uptake on cardiac scintigraphy and the tendency of amyloid cardiomyopathy to present as patchy infiltrates in its earlier stages, sampling error on EMB can be anticipated, limiting the yield in performing EMBs in patients with grade 1 uptake.
37

In conclusion, in a cohort of patients with suspected ATTR‐CA who were referred for cardiac scintigraphy and were found with a grade 1 uptake score with no evidence of light‐chain monoclonality, we report a stable clinical, laboratory, imaging, and scintigraphy phenotype along with a benign survival profile at long‐term follow‐up. Larger prospective studies and dedicated expert panels should further define the optimal evaluation strategies in patients with a grade 1 myocardial scintigraphy uptake.
