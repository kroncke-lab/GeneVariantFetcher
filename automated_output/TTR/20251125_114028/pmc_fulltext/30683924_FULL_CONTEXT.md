## Estimating the prevalence of allelic variants in the transthyretin gene by analysing large-scale sequencing data

### Abstract

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare disease characterised by extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils composed by transthyretin. ATTR amyloidosis can be sub-classified as wild-type ATTR (ATTR-wt) or as hereditary amyloidosis (ATTR-m); the prevalence of both types are likely underestimated. There are tools that can help us to study ATTR-m, as gnomAD database. Our primary aim was to estimate prevalence of variants, especially amyloidogenic variants, in the TTR gene using gnomAD database. We analysed TTR missense variants found in gnomAD. The variables studied were classified according to their clinical significance and according to the different populations. We found 71 missense variants in the TTR gene. Eleven variants were described as affects function variants (prevalence 1:230). The most frequently detected variant were c.424G>A (p.(Val142Ile)) (prevalence 1:332, MAF 0.00151) and c.148G>A (p.(Val50Met)) (prevalence 1:4924, MAF 0.000102), which represented 88% and 5%, respectively, of all affects function variants detected. Seventeen variants were classified as probably affects function, 29 as unknown variants, 4 as probably does not affect function and 10 as does not affect function variants. In terms of different populations, c.424G>A (p.(Val142Ile)) was especially prevalent in African population (MAF 0.01602; prevalence of 1:31) and c.148G>A (p.(Val50Met)) in European population (MAF 0.000179; prevalence of 1:2792). Prevalence of amyloidogenic variants in the general population was higher than prevalence heretofore described. This difference could be explained by incomplete penetrance of the disease, but other factors contributing to this fact, fundamentally the underdiagnosis of the disease.
