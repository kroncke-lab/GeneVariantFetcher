## Probing the dissociation pathway of a kinetically labile transthyretin mutant

### Abstract

Aggregation of transthyretin (TTR) is associated with devastating amyloid diseases. Amyloidosis begins with dissociation of the native homotetramer (a dimer of dimers) to form a monomeric intermediate that assembles into pathogenic aggregates. This process is accelerated in vitro at low pH, but the process by which TTR dissociates and reassembles at neutral pH remains poorly characterized due to the low population of intermediates. Here we use 19F-NMR and a highly sensitive trifluoromethyl probe to determine the relative populations of the species formed by dissociation of a destabilized variant, A25T. The A25T mutation perturbs both the strong dimer and weak dimer-dimer interfaces. A tetramer⇌dimer⇌monomer (TDM) equilibrium model is proposed to account for concentration- and temperature-dependent population changes. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters and activation energetics for dissociation of the native A25T tetramer, as well as a destabilized alternative tetramer (T*) with a mispacked F87 side chain, were extracted by 19F-NMR van’t Hoff, lineshape analysis, saturation transfer and transition state theory. The 19F and methyl chemical shifts of probes close to the strong dimer interface are degenerate in the dimer and T* species, implicating interfacial perturbation as a common structural feature of these destabilized species. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations further suggest more frequent F87 ring flipping on the nanosecond timescale in the A25T dimer than in the native A25T tetramer. Our integrated approach offers quantitative insights into the energy landscape of the dissociation pathway of TTR at neutral pH.
