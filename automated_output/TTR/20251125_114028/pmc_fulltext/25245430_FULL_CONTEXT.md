## Quantification of Quaternary
Structure Stability in
Aggregation-Prone Proteins under Physiological Conditions: The Transthyretin
Case

### Abstract

The quaternary structure stability
of proteins is typically studied
under conditions that accelerate their aggregation/unfolding processes
on convenient laboratory time scales. Such conditions include high
temperature or pressure, chaotrope-mediated unfolding, or low or high
pH. These approaches have the limitation of being nonphysiological
and that the concentration of the protein in solution is changing
as the reactions proceed. We describe a methodology to define the
quaternary structure stability of the amyloidogenic homotetrameric
protein transthyretin (TTR) under physiological conditions. This methodology
expands from a described approach based on the measurement of the
rate of subunit exchange of TTR with a tandem flag-tagged (FT2) TTR counterpart. We demonstrate that subunit exchange of
TTR with FT2·TTR can be analyzed and quantified using
a semi-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique. In addition,
we biophysically characterized two FT2·TTR variants
derived from wild-type and the amyloidogenic variant Val122Ile TTR,
both of which are associated with cardiac amyloid deposition late
in life. The FT2·TTR variants have similar amyloidogenic
potential and similar thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities compared
to those of their nontagged counterparts. We utilized the methodology
to study the potential of the small molecule SOM0226, a repurposed
drug under clinical development for the prevention and treatment of
the TTR amyloidoses, to stabilize TTR. The results enabled us to characterize
the binding energetics of SOM0226 to TTR. The described technique
is well-suited to study the quaternary structure of other human aggregation-prone
proteins under physiological conditions.

### Experimental Procedures

All of the recombinant
TTR variants were prepared in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified by chromatography as described elsewhere.15,19 The final purification step consisted of gel filtration chromatography
on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The mobile phase was 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA (GF buffer).
Only the fractions corresponding to tetrameric protein were pooled.
For the F87M/L110M TTR, which is monomeric by design,20 only the fractions corresponding to the size of the monomer
were collected. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The molecular
masses of the TTR variants were as follows: WT TTR, 13 892
(theoretical 13 893); V122I TTR, 13 906 (theoretical
13 907); FT2·WT TTR, 15 882 (theoretical
15 883); FT2·V122I TTR, 15 896 (theoretical
15 897); and F87M/L110M TTR, 13 895 (theoretical, 13 896).
The proteins were stored in working size aliquots at −80 °C,
at concentrations lower than 45 μM (2.5 mg/mL) to prevent aggregation.

Acid-mediated
aggregation and fibril formation experiments were carried
out as described elsewhere.21,22 Briefly, TTR variants
in GF buffer (8 μM) were diluted 1:1 with acetate buffer (200
mM sodium acetate, pH 4.2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) to achieve a final
pH of 4.4. The TTR solutions were incubated without agitation at 37
°C for up to 7 days. Blank samples consisted of a mixture of
equal volumes of GF and acetate buffers. To minimize sample manipulation,
the reactions that were used to measure aggregation by turbidity and
thioflavin T fluorescence (see below) were incubated in cluster tubes
(Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA), whereas the reactions that were
used to measure amounts of soluble and insoluble TTR were incubated
in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes. In the experiments designed to
quantify the capacity of the small molecule SOM0226 to inhibit TTR
aggregation, 1000 μL of WT TTR or V122I TTR (8 μM, in
GF buffer) was added to 1.6 μL of SOM0226 (10 mM or 5 mM dissolved
in DMSO) to achieve TTR/SOM0226 ratios of 1:2 and 1:1. TTR solutions
in the presence of DMSO only (vehicle) were prepared in parallel.
The samples were then briefly vortexed and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min to allow SOM0226 binding to TTR. Acid-mediated aggregation
and fibril formation protocol were performed as detailed above. Blank
samples consisted of GF/DMSO (1000:1.6) mixed with an equal volume
of acetate buffer.

At the designated
time points, the acid-mediated TTR aggregation reactions (above) were
vortexed for 10 s and transferred into 1/2 area
96-well UV-transparent plates (Corning) in triplicate (50 μL/well).
The turbidities of the solutions at 330 and 400 nm were recorded using
a UV spectrophotometer (SpectramaxPlus, Molecular Devices). The average
optical density of the blanks was subtracted from each experimental
sample. The experiments were repeated at least twice in triplicate.
The data presented correspond to the average values from one experiment;
error bars represent standard deviations.

Four hundred microliters of
aggregated TTR solutions incubated in
Eppendorf tubes was directly centrifuged at 20 000g for
30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants
were carefully separated from the pellets. The protein concentration
in the supernatants was measured using 1/2 area
96-well UV-transparent plates in triplicate (50 μL/well). The
amount of aggregated (insoluble) TTR was determined by adding 200
μL of 8 M GndCl to the protein pellets. The samples were then
vortexed briefly and left at room temperature for 5 min to allow for
the disassembly of the TTR aggregates. The total TTR in the solutions
was then measured by UV spectrophotometry in 1/2 area 96-well UV-transparent plates in triplicate using an 8 M GndCl
solution as blank. The percentages of total soluble and insoluble
TTR were then calculated with respect to the total initial protein
content (soluble) at time zero. The experiment was repeated twice.
The data shown correspond to the average values from one experiment;
the error bars correspond to standard deviations.

The acid-mediated
TTR aggregation solutions described above were diluted 1:4 to a final
TTR concentration of 1 μM (TTR tetramer equivalents) in 200
mM Tris pH 8.0, buffer with 150 mM NaCl. Two microliters of a ThT
stock solution (2 mM in 200 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) was added
to 400 μL of the diluted TTR aggregates. The samples were vortexed
briefly and dispensed into black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates
(Corning) in triplicate (100 μL/well). ThT fluorescence was
recorded in a multiwell spectrofluorimeter (Tecan Safire 2, Austria)
with excitation and emission wavelengths at 440 and 482 nm, respectively,
and 5 nm bandwidths. The experiment was repeated twice. The data shown
correspond to the average values from one experiment; the error bars
are standard deviations.

Carbon-coated
copper grids (400 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, HA)
were glow-discharged and inverted on 5 μL TTR samples subjected
to acid-mediated aggregation (prepared as above) for 2 min. Excess
sample was removed. The grids were then placed on a droplet of 0.1%
ammonium acetate followed by a 2% uranyl acetate solution for 2 min.
Excess stain was removed, and the grids were allowed to air dry. Grids
were then examined on a Philips CM100 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsbrough,
OR) at 80 kV, and images were collected using a Megaview III CCD camera
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Lakewood, CO).

TTR denaturation
curves were prepared by incubating TTR at 2 μM (∼0.1
mg/mL) with 0–8 M urea solutions in sodium phosphate buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) for 4 days
at room temperature. For the renaturation curves, TTR was first unfolded
in 6.5 M GndCl at room temperature overnight. The next day, the proteins
were buffer-exchanged into 9 M urea (in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100
mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) and concentrated to 20 μM (∼1
mg/mL), conditions under which TTR remained completely unfolded. Dilutions
were then prepared to yield a final TTR concentration of 2 μM
over a wide range of urea concentrations (1–8 M). The renaturation
solutions were incubated for 24 h at room temperature before measurement
of the tertiary and quaternary structures.

The stability
of the TTR tertiary structure was determined by measuring
the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of urea over
a concentration range of 0–8 M, as described previously.21 Briefly, the samples were vortexed and transferred
into 1/2 area black 96-well plates (Corning)
in triplicate (50 μL/well), and the tryptophan fluorescence
was recorded with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission
wavelengths of 335 and 355 nm, with 10 nm bandwidth. The percentage
of folded protein at each urea concentration was calculated from the
fluorescence ratios (355/335 nm) with respect to TTR samples without
urea (100% folded) or in 9 M urea (0% folded). The data were fit by
sigmoidal curves with variable slope using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA), and the concentration of urea at which 50% of the
TTR was folded (Cm) was calculated. For
the determination of the dissociation constants (Kdiss), TTR samples (2 μM) in 4.5–6 M urea
solutions in 0.5 M intervals (concentrations corresponding to the
TTR unfolding post-transition zone) were dispensed into 1/2 area 96-well black plates in triplicate. The tryptophan
fluorescence of the samples was recorded immediately and at several
time-points over a 96 h period. Between readings, the plates were
sealed and kept in an airtight moisturized plastic box to avoid sample
evaporation, at room temperature. The experimental samples also included
native TTR variants (0 M urea, 100% folded) and 100% unfolded TTR
to serve as references. To obtain completely unfolded TTR, the proteins
were first incubated in 6.5 M GndCl for 24 h and then buffer exchanged
in 9 M urea as described previously.21 The
raw data were plotted in GraphPad Prism, and they were fit to monoexponential
curves to determine the dissociation rate constants (Kdiss). The natural logarithm of the obtained Kdiss at each urea concentration from two independent experiments
was plotted against urea concentration, and a linear regression was
used to obtain the Kdiss at 0 M urea by
linear extrapolation (Table 2).

The TTR quaternary structure was determined
using the small molecule resveratrol as described elsewhere.21,22 Resveratrol binds in the T4 binding pocket of tetrameric
TTR, resulting in increased fluorescence quantum yield in a concentration-dependent
manner.22 To determine the content of tetrameric
TTR in the denaturation and renaturation solutions (above), 4 μL
of 1 mM resveratrol stock (in DMSO) was added to 200 μL of each
TTR sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots
of 50 μL were then transferred into 1/2 area black 96-well plates in triplicate, and the resveratrol fluorescence
was recorded (ex/em 320/394 nm, 10 nm bandwidth). To calculate the
percentage of tetrameric TTR at each urea concentration, the average
of the resveratrol fluorescence recorded at low urea concentrations
(1–2 M) and at high urea concentration (9 M) was regarded as
100% tetramer and 0% tetramer, respectively. The data were fit by
sigmoidal curves with variable slopes using GraphPad Prism, and the
concentration of urea at which 50% of TTR is tetrameric (Cm) was calculated.

The TTR proteins were
dialyzed in Tris buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and diluted to 8
μM. Equal volumes of non-flag-tagged TTR (WT or V122I) and flag-tagged
TTR (FT2·WT or FT2·V122I) were mixed,
and the reactions were incubated at 4, 25, and 37 °C for several
periods of time (1–96 h). To determine the TTR stabilization
effect of SOM0226 and tafamidis, the small molecules (dissolved in
DMSO) were first preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with
the desired TTR variants (8 μM) at a TTR/small molecule ratio
of 1:2. For SOM0226 Kd determination,
the TTR/small molecule ratio ranged from 1:0.25 to 1:2 mol equiv.
Equal volumes of WT and FT2·WT were then mixed and
incubated at 37 °C for up to 3 days. Aliquots of 50 μL
were taken at multiple time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h)
and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. For the studies in
which the less stable V122I TTR variant was used, we noticed that
upon sample storage at −80 °C the subunit exchange reactions
were still proceeding, resulting in time 0 samples where subunit exchange
was already occurring. To overcome this limitation, the experiments
were performed in a reverse manner with the longer incubation time
point reactions starting first. Thus, all of the samples were analyzed
by semi-native PAGE without the need for storage at −80 °C.

Subunit exchanged products were analyzed
by semi-native PAGE as follows: we used in-house-cast 11% acrylamide/bis(acrylamide)
(30:0.8 w/w), 0.1% SDS mini gels prepared in 395 mM TrisHCl buffer,
pH 8.8, with a stacking layer containing 4% acrylamide/bis(acrylamide),
0.1% SDS in 375 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 6.8. For sample analysis, 4
μL of 6× SDS loading buffer (350 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 30%
glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 M dithiothreitol, 0.012% bromophenol blue)
was mixed with 20 μL of the subunit exchange reactions. Ten
microliters was then directly loaded onto the gels in duplicate without
boiling. The gels were run at a constant 40 V until the blue dye reached
the bottom, and then they were stained with SYPRO Ruby following the
manufacturer’s instructions (SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain,
Lonza). Briefly, the gels were fixed in 10% MeOH/7% AcOH (v/v) solution
for 20 min at room temperature, and then SYPRO Ruby staining solution
was added and incubated overnight. The gels were destained with 10%
MeOH/7% AcOH solution for 1–3 h, and the protein bands were
visualized and captured using a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad). Particular
attention was taken to make sure that the bands in the gels were not
saturated. The band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software
(NIH).

To quantitate the
disappearance of the homotetramers with or without FT2,
the band intensities at each time point were normalized to those at
time 0. To quantitate the appearance of the heterotetramer composed
of two FT2 subunits and two nontagged subunits, we measured
the density of the middle band (2 FT2 subunits, band 3)
of each sample and normalized it by the total density of the lane
(total protein) to obtain the percent of band 3 or extent of exchange.
For Kd determination of SOM0226 binding
to WT TTR, we calculated the extent of exchange at each experimental
time point. At saturation, the predicted stoichiometries for the five
tetramers (containing 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 FT2 subunits) are
1:4:6:4:1; thus, band 3 (2 FT2 subunits) represents 6/16
or 0.375 of the total band density. The fraction of exchange was calculated
as (extent of exchange)/0.375. The reported rate constants of exchange
were determined from plotting the fraction of exchange as a function
of time and fitting the data by a first-order single-exponential kinetic
equation, as implemented in the Mathematica software. The Kd values were then determined from the dependence
of the exchange rate constants on the concentration of ligand as described
previously.23,24

The untagged TTR variants
(WT TTR, V122I TTR) and tagged TTR (FT2·WT, FT2·V122I) were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde as previously
described.19 Briefly, 40 μL of the
TTR variants at 4 μM (in GF buffer) was treated with 4 μL
of glutaraldehyde (25% solution, Sigma) and incubated at room temperature
for 5 min. The reactions were quenched by addition of 4 μL of
7% NaBH4 (freshly prepared in 0.1 M NaOH).

We
used resveratrol as a developing agent to detect tetrameric TTR on
semi-native 15% PAGE. Resveratrol binds to tetrameric TTR, and the
binding results in a sizable increase in fluorescence. Resveratrol
does not bind or fluoresce with monomeric TTR. To stain the gels,
we prepared 100 μM resveratrol solution in water from a 1 mM
stock (in DMSO). The gels were first washed with Milli-Q water for
5 min, 3 times, and then incubated with 100 μM resveratrol solution
for 30 min in the dark followed by another wash with Milli-Q water
for 5 min. Resveratrol fluorescence was visualized and captured by
a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad) under UV light. The gels were then stained
with Coomassie blue under standard conditions to visualize all of
the proteins in the gel.

### Recombinant Protein Preparation

All of the recombinant
TTR variants were prepared in an Escherichia coli expression system and purified by chromatography as described elsewhere.15,19 The final purification step consisted of gel filtration chromatography
on a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). The mobile phase was 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA (GF buffer).
Only the fractions corresponding to tetrameric protein were pooled.
For the F87M/L110M TTR, which is monomeric by design,20 only the fractions corresponding to the size of the monomer
were collected. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). The molecular
masses of the TTR variants were as follows: WT TTR, 13 892
(theoretical 13 893); V122I TTR, 13 906 (theoretical
13 907); FT2·WT TTR, 15 882 (theoretical
15 883); FT2·V122I TTR, 15 896 (theoretical
15 897); and F87M/L110M TTR, 13 895 (theoretical, 13 896).
The proteins were stored in working size aliquots at −80 °C,
at concentrations lower than 45 μM (2.5 mg/mL) to prevent aggregation.

### Acid-Mediated TTR Aggregation and Fibril Formation

Acid-mediated
aggregation and fibril formation experiments were carried
out as described elsewhere.21,22 Briefly, TTR variants
in GF buffer (8 μM) were diluted 1:1 with acetate buffer (200
mM sodium acetate, pH 4.2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) to achieve a final
pH of 4.4. The TTR solutions were incubated without agitation at 37
°C for up to 7 days. Blank samples consisted of a mixture of
equal volumes of GF and acetate buffers. To minimize sample manipulation,
the reactions that were used to measure aggregation by turbidity and
thioflavin T fluorescence (see below) were incubated in cluster tubes
(Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA), whereas the reactions that were
used to measure amounts of soluble and insoluble TTR were incubated
in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes. In the experiments designed to
quantify the capacity of the small molecule SOM0226 to inhibit TTR
aggregation, 1000 μL of WT TTR or V122I TTR (8 μM, in
GF buffer) was added to 1.6 μL of SOM0226 (10 mM or 5 mM dissolved
in DMSO) to achieve TTR/SOM0226 ratios of 1:2 and 1:1. TTR solutions
in the presence of DMSO only (vehicle) were prepared in parallel.
The samples were then briefly vortexed and incubated at room temperature
for 30 min to allow SOM0226 binding to TTR. Acid-mediated aggregation
and fibril formation protocol were performed as detailed above. Blank
samples consisted of GF/DMSO (1000:1.6) mixed with an equal volume
of acetate buffer.

### TTR Aggregation Measured by Turbidity

At the designated
time points, the acid-mediated TTR aggregation reactions (above) were
vortexed for 10 s and transferred into 1/2 area
96-well UV-transparent plates (Corning) in triplicate (50 μL/well).
The turbidities of the solutions at 330 and 400 nm were recorded using
a UV spectrophotometer (SpectramaxPlus, Molecular Devices). The average
optical density of the blanks was subtracted from each experimental
sample. The experiments were repeated at least twice in triplicate.
The data presented correspond to the average values from one experiment;
error bars represent standard deviations.

### Measurement of Amounts
of Soluble and Insoluble TTR

Four hundred microliters of
aggregated TTR solutions incubated in
Eppendorf tubes was directly centrifuged at 20 000g for
30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants
were carefully separated from the pellets. The protein concentration
in the supernatants was measured using 1/2 area
96-well UV-transparent plates in triplicate (50 μL/well). The
amount of aggregated (insoluble) TTR was determined by adding 200
μL of 8 M GndCl to the protein pellets. The samples were then
vortexed briefly and left at room temperature for 5 min to allow for
the disassembly of the TTR aggregates. The total TTR in the solutions
was then measured by UV spectrophotometry in 1/2 area 96-well UV-transparent plates in triplicate using an 8 M GndCl
solution as blank. The percentages of total soluble and insoluble
TTR were then calculated with respect to the total initial protein
content (soluble) at time zero. The experiment was repeated twice.
The data shown correspond to the average values from one experiment;
the error bars correspond to standard deviations.

### Thioflavin
T (ThT) Binding Fluorescence

The acid-mediated
TTR aggregation solutions described above were diluted 1:4 to a final
TTR concentration of 1 μM (TTR tetramer equivalents) in 200
mM Tris pH 8.0, buffer with 150 mM NaCl. Two microliters of a ThT
stock solution (2 mM in 200 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) was added
to 400 μL of the diluted TTR aggregates. The samples were vortexed
briefly and dispensed into black-wall, clear-bottom 96-well plates
(Corning) in triplicate (100 μL/well). ThT fluorescence was
recorded in a multiwell spectrofluorimeter (Tecan Safire 2, Austria)
with excitation and emission wavelengths at 440 and 482 nm, respectively,
and 5 nm bandwidths. The experiment was repeated twice. The data shown
correspond to the average values from one experiment; the error bars
are standard deviations.

### Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Carbon-coated
copper grids (400 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, HA)
were glow-discharged and inverted on 5 μL TTR samples subjected
to acid-mediated aggregation (prepared as above) for 2 min. Excess
sample was removed. The grids were then placed on a droplet of 0.1%
ammonium acetate followed by a 2% uranyl acetate solution for 2 min.
Excess stain was removed, and the grids were allowed to air dry. Grids
were then examined on a Philips CM100 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsbrough,
OR) at 80 kV, and images were collected using a Megaview III CCD camera
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, Lakewood, CO).

### TTR Denaturation
and Renaturation Curves

TTR denaturation
curves were prepared by incubating TTR at 2 μM (∼0.1
mg/mL) with 0–8 M urea solutions in sodium phosphate buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) for 4 days
at room temperature. For the renaturation curves, TTR was first unfolded
in 6.5 M GndCl at room temperature overnight. The next day, the proteins
were buffer-exchanged into 9 M urea (in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 100
mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6) and concentrated to 20 μM (∼1
mg/mL), conditions under which TTR remained completely unfolded. Dilutions
were then prepared to yield a final TTR concentration of 2 μM
over a wide range of urea concentrations (1–8 M). The renaturation
solutions were incubated for 24 h at room temperature before measurement
of the tertiary and quaternary structures.

### Determination of the TTR
Tertiary Structure by Tryptophan Fluorescence

The stability
of the TTR tertiary structure was determined by measuring
the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of urea over
a concentration range of 0–8 M, as described previously.21 Briefly, the samples were vortexed and transferred
into 1/2 area black 96-well plates (Corning)
in triplicate (50 μL/well), and the tryptophan fluorescence
was recorded with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission
wavelengths of 335 and 355 nm, with 10 nm bandwidth. The percentage
of folded protein at each urea concentration was calculated from the
fluorescence ratios (355/335 nm) with respect to TTR samples without
urea (100% folded) or in 9 M urea (0% folded). The data were fit by
sigmoidal curves with variable slope using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA), and the concentration of urea at which 50% of the
TTR was folded (Cm) was calculated. For
the determination of the dissociation constants (Kdiss), TTR samples (2 μM) in 4.5–6 M urea
solutions in 0.5 M intervals (concentrations corresponding to the
TTR unfolding post-transition zone) were dispensed into 1/2 area 96-well black plates in triplicate. The tryptophan
fluorescence of the samples was recorded immediately and at several
time-points over a 96 h period. Between readings, the plates were
sealed and kept in an airtight moisturized plastic box to avoid sample
evaporation, at room temperature. The experimental samples also included
native TTR variants (0 M urea, 100% folded) and 100% unfolded TTR
to serve as references. To obtain completely unfolded TTR, the proteins
were first incubated in 6.5 M GndCl for 24 h and then buffer exchanged
in 9 M urea as described previously.21 The
raw data were plotted in GraphPad Prism, and they were fit to monoexponential
curves to determine the dissociation rate constants (Kdiss). The natural logarithm of the obtained Kdiss at each urea concentration from two independent experiments
was plotted against urea concentration, and a linear regression was
used to obtain the Kdiss at 0 M urea by
linear extrapolation (Table 2).

### Determination
of the TTR Quaternary Structure by Resveratrol
Binding Fluorescence

The TTR quaternary structure was determined
using the small molecule resveratrol as described elsewhere.21,22 Resveratrol binds in the T4 binding pocket of tetrameric
TTR, resulting in increased fluorescence quantum yield in a concentration-dependent
manner.22 To determine the content of tetrameric
TTR in the denaturation and renaturation solutions (above), 4 μL
of 1 mM resveratrol stock (in DMSO) was added to 200 μL of each
TTR sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Aliquots
of 50 μL were then transferred into 1/2 area black 96-well plates in triplicate, and the resveratrol fluorescence
was recorded (ex/em 320/394 nm, 10 nm bandwidth). To calculate the
percentage of tetrameric TTR at each urea concentration, the average
of the resveratrol fluorescence recorded at low urea concentrations
(1–2 M) and at high urea concentration (9 M) was regarded as
100% tetramer and 0% tetramer, respectively. The data were fit by
sigmoidal curves with variable slopes using GraphPad Prism, and the
concentration of urea at which 50% of TTR is tetrameric (Cm) was calculated.

### TTR Subunit Exchange Reactions

The TTR proteins were
dialyzed in Tris buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and diluted to 8
μM. Equal volumes of non-flag-tagged TTR (WT or V122I) and flag-tagged
TTR (FT2·WT or FT2·V122I) were mixed,
and the reactions were incubated at 4, 25, and 37 °C for several
periods of time (1–96 h). To determine the TTR stabilization
effect of SOM0226 and tafamidis, the small molecules (dissolved in
DMSO) were first preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with
the desired TTR variants (8 μM) at a TTR/small molecule ratio
of 1:2. For SOM0226 Kd determination,
the TTR/small molecule ratio ranged from 1:0.25 to 1:2 mol equiv.
Equal volumes of WT and FT2·WT were then mixed and
incubated at 37 °C for up to 3 days. Aliquots of 50 μL
were taken at multiple time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h)
and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. For the studies in
which the less stable V122I TTR variant was used, we noticed that
upon sample storage at −80 °C the subunit exchange reactions
were still proceeding, resulting in time 0 samples where subunit exchange
was already occurring. To overcome this limitation, the experiments
were performed in a reverse manner with the longer incubation time
point reactions starting first. Thus, all of the samples were analyzed
by semi-native PAGE without the need for storage at −80 °C.

### Semi-Native PAGE

Subunit exchanged products were analyzed
by semi-native PAGE as follows: we used in-house-cast 11% acrylamide/bis(acrylamide)
(30:0.8 w/w), 0.1% SDS mini gels prepared in 395 mM TrisHCl buffer,
pH 8.8, with a stacking layer containing 4% acrylamide/bis(acrylamide),
0.1% SDS in 375 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 6.8. For sample analysis, 4
μL of 6× SDS loading buffer (350 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 30%
glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 M dithiothreitol, 0.012% bromophenol blue)
was mixed with 20 μL of the subunit exchange reactions. Ten
microliters was then directly loaded onto the gels in duplicate without
boiling. The gels were run at a constant 40 V until the blue dye reached
the bottom, and then they were stained with SYPRO Ruby following the
manufacturer’s instructions (SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain,
Lonza). Briefly, the gels were fixed in 10% MeOH/7% AcOH (v/v) solution
for 20 min at room temperature, and then SYPRO Ruby staining solution
was added and incubated overnight. The gels were destained with 10%
MeOH/7% AcOH solution for 1–3 h, and the protein bands were
visualized and captured using a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad). Particular
attention was taken to make sure that the bands in the gels were not
saturated. The band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software
(NIH).

### Quantification of Subunit Exchange

To quantitate the
disappearance of the homotetramers with or without FT2,
the band intensities at each time point were normalized to those at
time 0. To quantitate the appearance of the heterotetramer composed
of two FT2 subunits and two nontagged subunits, we measured
the density of the middle band (2 FT2 subunits, band 3)
of each sample and normalized it by the total density of the lane
(total protein) to obtain the percent of band 3 or extent of exchange.
For Kd determination of SOM0226 binding
to WT TTR, we calculated the extent of exchange at each experimental
time point. At saturation, the predicted stoichiometries for the five
tetramers (containing 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 FT2 subunits) are
1:4:6:4:1; thus, band 3 (2 FT2 subunits) represents 6/16
or 0.375 of the total band density. The fraction of exchange was calculated
as (extent of exchange)/0.375. The reported rate constants of exchange
were determined from plotting the fraction of exchange as a function
of time and fitting the data by a first-order single-exponential kinetic
equation, as implemented in the Mathematica software. The Kd values were then determined from the dependence
of the exchange rate constants on the concentration of ligand as described
previously.23,24

### Glutaraldehyde Cross-Linking

The untagged TTR variants
(WT TTR, V122I TTR) and tagged TTR (FT2·WT, FT2·V122I) were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde as previously
described.19 Briefly, 40 μL of the
TTR variants at 4 μM (in GF buffer) was treated with 4 μL
of glutaraldehyde (25% solution, Sigma) and incubated at room temperature
for 5 min. The reactions were quenched by addition of 4 μL of
7% NaBH4 (freshly prepared in 0.1 M NaOH).

### In-Gel Staining
of Tetrameric TTR by Resveratrol

We
used resveratrol as a developing agent to detect tetrameric TTR on
semi-native 15% PAGE. Resveratrol binds to tetrameric TTR, and the
binding results in a sizable increase in fluorescence. Resveratrol
does not bind or fluoresce with monomeric TTR. To stain the gels,
we prepared 100 μM resveratrol solution in water from a 1 mM
stock (in DMSO). The gels were first washed with Milli-Q water for
5 min, 3 times, and then incubated with 100 μM resveratrol solution
for 30 min in the dark followed by another wash with Milli-Q water
for 5 min. Resveratrol fluorescence was visualized and captured by
a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad) under UV light. The gels were then stained
with Coomassie blue under standard conditions to visualize all of
the proteins in the gel.

### Results

TTR aggregation and amyloidogenesis can be induced in vitro by incubation under mildly acidic conditions.14,21 FT2·WT and FT2·V122I TTR together
with their nontagged counterparts (WT and V122I) were incubated for
1, 3, and 7 days at 37 °C and pH 4.4 (the pH of maximum aggregation
for both WT and V122I TTR). TTR aggregation was measured by quantification
of total protein precipitated, turbidity at 330 nm, and by thioflavin
T (ThT) binding fluorescence. The data show that FT2·TTR
variants have similar, albeit slightly higher (5–10%), aggregation
propensity as that of their nontagged counterparts when measured by
total protein precipitated (Figure 1a). Measurement
of aggregation by turbidity (Figure 1b) appears
to result in an increase of 5–42% in the FT2-proteins
compared to their nontagged counterparts. The differences are particularly
pronounced for FT2·WT TTR with respect to WT (24–42%
increase in turbidity). However, we have previously shown that turbidity
measurements give an estimate of aggregation, but, due to the different
morphologies of the aggregates, the values can substantially differ
between different TTR variants, even though the total aggregated protein
is the same.21 ThT fluorescence is an indicator
that amyloid species are formed in the aggregation reactions.25 Both FT2·WT and FT2·V122I TTR display ThT fluorescence upon aggregation, suggesting
that these proteins, as with their nontagged counterparts, form amyloid-like
aggregates (Figure 1c). In all cases, the ThT
signal for the FT2·TTR variants is lower than that
of the nontagged WT and V122I TTR (Figure 1c). It is known that not all the diverse TTR aggregate morphologies
bind ThT with the same efficiency.26 Our
data suggest that FT2·WT and FT2·V122I
TTR under acidic conditions might result in a distribution of aggregated
species that is in a small degree different from that of WT and V122I
TTR.

Relative aggregation of FT2·WT TTR and FT2·V122I TTR variants with respect to their non-flag-tagged counterparts.
TTR variants were incubated at pH 4.4 for up to 7 days at 37 °C.
The extent of aggregation was measured by (a) percentage of insoluble
protein at each time point with respect to initial total (soluble)
protein, (b) turbidity at 330 nm, and (c) thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired
to
evaluate the morphologies of the TTR species in the acid-mediated
aggregation reactions (Figure 2). WT and V122I
TTR samples incubated for 1 day at 37 °C (panels a and c, respectively)
were characterized by the presence of elongated material (solid arrows)
as well as abundant small spherical aggregates (broken circles). The
samples also had thicker elongated deposits (arrow heads) and larger
amorphous aggregates (solid circles) that were more abundant in the
faster aggregating V122I TTR samples than in the WT TTR samples. For
FT2·WT TTR (1 day incubation, panel b), the grids
showed similar morphologies to those found in the WT TTR samples with
apparently more abundant small amorphous spherical aggregates (broken
circles). In contrast, the grids containing FT2·V122I
TTR (1 day incubation, panel d) were rich in very thin elongated material
(insert in panel d), but no thicker elongated deposits such as those
structures shown in panel c (solid arrows and arrow heads) were observed.
Samples incubated for 3 days at 37 °C (panels e–g) show
more abundant and thicker elongated material (arrowheads) than the
samples incubated for 1 day at 37 °C, indicating that the aggregation
process was still developing. For the FT2·V122I TTR
sample (panel h), we could see only the same structures as those found
after 1 day of incubation: small spherical aggregates and very thin
filaments (panel d). Only in the V122I TTR samples (panel g) did we
find twisted fibrils 200–250 nm long (left) and large amorphous
aggregates as those shown in panel g, right. We must note, however,
that most of the material from the samples incubated for 3 and 7 days
at 37 °C, especially those with V122I TTR variants, was characterized
by the presence of large and dense deposits opaque to TEM (not shown).

Urea-mediated denaturation/renaturation curves were obtained to determine
the tetramer thermodynamic stability of FT2·WT and
FT2·V122I TTR with respect to that of WT and V122I
TTR. Previous studies have shown that urea cannot directly unfold
tetrameric TTR;27 the unfolding process,
like the aggregation process, requires rate-limiting tetramer dissociation
into its corresponding monomers, which is followed by monomer unfolding.
Thus, urea is a suitable chaotrope to estimate tetrameric TTR stability.

The loss of TTR quaternary structure was measured by resveratrol
fluorescence,22 which is known to bind
to and fluoresce only in the presence of tetrameric TTR and not in
the presence of monomeric TTR.21,22 Under the conditions
of the assay, resveratrol minimally perturbs the tetramer–monomer
equilibrium; thus, it is an appropriate probe to quantify the loss
of TTR quaternary structure upon incubation with urea.

The urea-induced
TTR tertiary structural changes (i.e., unfolding)
were measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, which allows the
quantification of the fraction of folded protein at any urea concentration.21,22,28 Given that in urea the limiting
step in the unfolding process is the tetramer disassembly, the rate
and extent of unfolding are measures of tetramer stability as well.14

Figure 3 shows
the unfolding and refolding
curves for the WT and V122I isoforms in urea. The data were fitted
by sigmoidal dose–response curves with variable slope. The
midpoint of the transitions between folded/unfolded (measured by tryptophan
fluorescence) or tetramer/nontetramer (measured by resveratrol binding
fluorescence) Cm (in molar units) was
calculated and are summarized in Table 1.

fluorescence; tetramer disassembly and reassembly were measured by
resveratrol-binding fluorescence.

the significant changes in Cm for the

Thermodynamic
stability curves of FT2·TTR and TTR
variants in urea. WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR (a–d)
and V122I TTR and FT2·V122I TTR (e–h) were
incubated in the presence of various concentrations of urea. The curves
were generated in the denaturation direction (a, c, e, g) starting
with folded proteins and in the renaturation direction (b, d, f, h)
starting with unfolded proteins. The amount of folded TTR at any given
urea concentration was measured by tryptophan fluorescence (a, b,
e, f), and the amount of tetrameric TTR at any given urea concentration
was measured by resveratrol fluorescence (c, d, g, h). WT TTR: solid
squares, solid lines; FT2·WT TTR: solid circles, broken
lines; V122I TTR: open squares, solid lines; FT2·V122I
TTR: open circles, broken lines. Data shown represents the average
of two independent experiments performed in triplicate (mean ±
SD).

For all proteins, the Cm values for
tetramer disassembly and reassembly are slightly lower than the Cm values for unfolding and refolding, consistent
with the notion that the tetramer must first dissociate before it
can unfold. In urea, tetramer disassembly and unfolding are processes
that take days and can vary substantially for different TTR variants.17 The refolding and tetramer reassembly processes
are much faster and are mostly complete in a matter of seconds.22 Thus, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium
is more easily reached from the unfolded state in the refolding/reassembly
reactions. This fact is reflected in Figure 3, where, in the denaturation direction, folded and tetrameric TTR
can still be detected at the time of measurement (96 h incubation
time). Longer incubation times in urea can result in urea-mediated
protein modification and are not desirable.29 Although the Cm values for the denaturation
and renaturation processes are similar, for the sake of clarity, we
will focus on the renaturation processes where thermodynamic equilibrium
has been reached.

The data show that the FT2·TTR
variants have slightly
lower Cm values than their nontagged counterparts
(Table 1), suggesting that appending FT2 at the N-terminus of the protein decreases, to some degree,
its thermodynamic stability. The effect appears to be more pronounced
for the V122I variant, for which the tetramer reassembly Cm values for V122I and FT2·V122I TTR are
3.0 and 2.6 M, respectively.

We next studied
the kinetic stability of the FT2·TTR variants by measuring
the rates of denaturation. In our experience, measuring the rate of
unfolding by tryptophan fluorescence gives more robust data than measuring
the rate of tetramer dissociation by resveratrol fluorescence. Given
that tetramer dissociation is the limiting step of the overall unfolding
process, the rate of unfolding can be linked to the rate of tetramer
dissociation, as long as the urea concentration is high enough to
guarantee complete unfolding. Hammarström et al. validated
this notion by determining that monomeric TTR unfolding rate is ∼5
× 105 times faster than that of tetrameric TTR.14 Thus, we measured the rate of unfolding of the
FT2·TTR variants side-by-side with their nontagged
counterparts. We used urea concentrations that are in the post-transition
region for tertiary structural changes (i.e., >4.0 M urea), to
be
able to link tetramer disassembly and monomer unfolding (Figure 4). The dissociation time
courses fit best to a single-exponential curve over the range of urea
concentrations described by the equation I355/335= IN355/335 + A (1 – e–Kdiss.t), were IN355/335 is the native protein fluorescence intensity
ratio (355/335 nm), A is the amplitude change, Kdiss is the tetramer dissociation rate constant,
and t is the time in hours. Figure 4a shows the denaturation kinetic curves at 6 M urea. The natural
logarithm of the dissociation constants (Kdiss) change linearly with urea concentration14 (Figure 4b). This observation allows the
extrapolation of Kdiss to the more physiologic
0 M urea concentration (Table 2). The data, which represents the average of two
independent experiments, show that FT2·WT TTR has
the same kinetic stability as that of WT TTR within error, whereas
FT2·V122I TTR appears to be kinetically less stable
than V122I TTR. The estimated half time for dissociation (1/Kdiss) is in the range of 30–51 h for
WT and FT2·WT TTR, 19–25 h for V122I, and 15–17
h for FT2·V122I TTR (Table 2).

Kinetics of TTR dissociation measured by unfolding rates. (a) Unfolding
kinetics at 6 M urea measured by tryptophan fluorescence; data fitted
to one-phase association reactions. (b) Natural logarithm of the rate
of tetramer dissociation (ln Kdiss, h–1) plotted as a function of urea concentration. The
plots are linear, allowing the extrapolation of Kdiss to 0 M urea (Table 2). The
data correspond to the average of two independent experiments. WT
TTR: solid squares, solid lines; FT2·WT TTR: solid
circles, broken lines; V122I TTR: open squares, solid lines; FT2·V122I TTR: open circles, broken lines.

Kdiss is the dissociation rate constant
for the tetramer; mkin is the dependence
of Kdiss on urea concentration; t50 is the half
time for dissociation. Data extrapolated from dissociation curves
generated at several urea concentrations from two independent experiments
(Figure 4).

The fact that FT2-labeled proteins are
somewhat less
stable than their nontagged counterparts implies that there will always
be FT2·TTR subunits available to exchange with a nontagged
protein. The FT2-labeled proteins will not be limiting
the rate and extent at which the reactions take place, thus affording bona fide measurement of the stability of the TTR variant
under study.

WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR in Laemmli
sample buffer with or without a boiling step were analyzed in an 11%
PAGE system. In order to determine the size of the TTR species under
these analytical conditions, we also cross-linked one set of TTR samples
with glutaraldehyde. The cross-linked samples, with or without boiling,
were analyzed by PAGE in parallel lanes. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking
followed by PAGE is a well-established method to determine protein
quaternary structure.23,30 After electrophoretic separation,
the gels were developed by Sypro Ruby staining (Figure 5a). Boiled native TTR runs near the 15 kDa molecular weight
maker, consistent with the size of the monomer; boiled cross-linked
TTR runs mainly as a wide band near the 55–75 kDa markers,
consistent with the size of a tetramer. Bands of lower intensity with
the size of dimer and monomer can also be observed and probably reflect
the fact that glutaraldehyde cross-linking is not 100% efficient.
When the boiling step was omitted, TTR appeared near the 35 kDa marker
for WT TTR and near the 40 kDa marker for FT2·WT TTR
whether they were cross-linked or not, suggesting that the cross-linked
and non-cross-linked TTR species were of the same size. Glutaraldehyde
cross-linked TTR coelutes with native TTR in a calibrated gel filtration
Superdex 75 column (Figure 5b), indicating
that cross-linking preserves the TTR tetramer (and does not generate
larger species).

Analyses of TTR species by (a) PAGE and (b) size-exclusion
chromatography.
(a) WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR were analyzed on an 11%
PAGE gel under several conditions, including with or without denaturing
(boiling) before electrophoresis and with or without quaternary structure
fixation by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde before analysis. Denatured
(boiled) TTR runs near the 15 kDa marker (monomer size), cross-linked
and boiled TTR runs near 55–75KDa (tetramer size), and nondenatured
(nonboiled) TTR (cross-linked or not) runs near the 30–40 kDa
marker. (b) Size-exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex
75 analytical column demonstrates that both WT TTR (solid lines) and
cross-linked WT TTR (dotted lines) have elution volumes consistent
with the size of a tetramer and no higher molecular weight species
are generated upon cross-linking.

Under standard PAGE conditions, the electrophoretic mobility
of
the proteins depends primarily on their molecular mass, whereas under
our semi-native PAGE conditions (unboiled samples), the mobility of
the proteins depends also on their shape and charge. This principle
may explain why the unboiled TTR samples (cross-linked or not) run
much faster through the gel than what is predicted from their molecular
weight (observed 35 kDa vs predicted 56 kDa). In these samples, TTR
is still folded and thus more compact compared to that in the boiled
TTR samples, which are denatured. The compact proteins move more freely
through the acrylamide mesh than the unfolded proteins, resulting
in bands with apparent lower molecular weight. Overall, the data demonstrate
that nonboiled native TTR runs as a tetramer in SDS-PAGE. We named
these conditions semi-native PAGE.

To further validate the notion
that under semi-native PAGE conditions
TTR runs as a tetramer, we used the small molecule resveratrol that,
by virtue of binding in the T4 binding pocket present only
in the native tetramer, becomes fluorescent. As mentioned above, resveratrol
does not bind to or fluoresce with monomeric TTR.22 The TTR samples analyzed by semi-native PAGE were as follows:
WT TTR, FT2·WT TTR, and an equimolar mixture of WT
and FT2·WT TTR that had been first unfolded in 6.5
M GndCl and then refolded to allow the formation of mixed heterotetramers.
A well-characterized TTR variant that is monomeric was also analyzed
as a control.20 After electrophoretic separation,
the gels were first stained with a 100 μM solution of resveratrol
(Figure 6, left panel) as detailed in the Experimental Procedures and then with Coomassie
blue to reveal all of the proteins in the gel (Figure 6, right panel). Figure 6 (resveratrol
staining) shows that the TTR variants run as tetramer under these
conditions because they are fluorescent; in contrast, the engineered
monomeric TTR variant (M-TTR) does not show resveratrol fluorescence.
Control gels in which the resveratrol solution was substituted by
DMSO (vehicle) display no fluorescence (not shown). We also measured
resveratrol fluorescence in the presence of WT TTR, S112I TTR (a recombinant
dimeric TTR variant),31 and the monomeric
M-TTR at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL. Only resveratrol
in the presence of WT tetrameric TTR displays fluorescence (not shown).
These results support the notion that in semi-native PAGE TTR runs
as a tetramer. Furthermore, it is clear from the gels shown in Figures 5 and 6 that FT2·TTR variants have much lower mobility than that of their nontagged
TTR counterparts. Samples consisting of unfolded/refolded equimolar
mixtures of WT TTR with FT2·TTR contain at least 3
resolved bands, in agreement with the presence of TTR heterotetramers.
Staining with the more sensitive Sypro Ruby dye clearly shows that
there are 5 bands forming upon subunit exchange (Figure 7), consistent with the formation of heterotetramers containing
0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 FT2-TTR subunits.

TTR species analyzed
by semi-native PAGE (nonboiled samples) and
visualized consecutively by resveratrol fluorescence staining (left
panel) and Coomassie staining (right panel). The samples analyzed
are WT TTR, FT2·WT TTR, an equimolar mixture of WT
TTR and FT2·WT TTR that had previously been unfolded
and refolded to allow the formation of mixed heterotetramers (labeled
WT/FT2·WT), and a well characterized engineered monomeric
TTR variant, M-TTR.20 When resveratrol
is bound to tetrameric TTR species, it is fluorescent, demonstrating
that semi-native PAGE conserves TTR tetrameric quaternary structure.

FT2·WT TTR incubated at 4, 25, and 37 °C for
different time periods (0–72 h). (a) Gels stained with Sypro
Ruby (arrowhead points to band 3). (b) Quantitation of the upper bands

of the TTR heterotetramer composed of two FT2·WT subunits
and two WT TTR subunits (band 3). Data representing quantitation of
the homotetramers (b, c) were normalized to band intensities at time
0; the data were fitted by one-phase decay curves. Data representing
quantitation of band 3 (d) were not normalized; the data were fitted
by one-phase association curves. Symbols: circles, 4 °C; squares,
25 °C; triangles, 37 °C.

All of our FT2·WT and FT2·V122I
TTR preparations have a small impurity whose mobility is consistent
with that of a homotetramer composed of 3 FT2-subunits
and one untagged subunit. We attribute it to a proteolysis event during
synthesis in E. coli. The presence
of this same impurity was also noticed in a recent paper describing
the use of TTR subunit exchange coupled to ultraperformance liquid
chromatography,32 where it was demonstrated
that it does not modify the kinetics of the subunit exchange reactions.

Equal amounts of FT2·WT and WT TTR were mixed and
incubated over time at 4, 25, and 37 °C in buffer at pH 7.4.
The samples were then analyzed in duplicate by semi-native PAGE, and
the gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Figure 7). We quantified the disappearance of the bands corresponding to
FT2·WT homotetramer (top band, panel b) and WT homotetramer
(lower band, panel c) and the appearance of the most abundant heterotetramer
(middle band) consisting of 2 FT2·WT subunits and
2 WT subunits (band 3, panel d). The data were fitted by decreasing
(for FT2·WT and WT TTR disappearance) or increasing
(for heterotetramer formation, band 3) monoexponential equations;
the r2 values for the fits were >0.9.
The subunit exchange is faster at 4 °C than at 25 or 37 °C.
This observation is consistent with previous studies in which similar
TTR mixtures were analyzed by high-resolution ion exchange chromatography15 and is also in agreement with the notion that
there is a significant contribution from the hydrophobic effect on
TTR tetramer stability.14 We attribute
the faster disappearance of FT2·WT homotetramer compared
to that of the WT homotetramer at all temperatures to the fact that
the former is less stable than the latter (Figure 3 and Table 1).

We also compared
the subunit exchange rates between WT TTR and FT2·WT
TTR and the kinetically less stable V122I and FT2·V122I
TTR. As expected, V122I/FT2·V122I TTR exchanged subunits
much faster than WT/FT2·WT TTR (Supporting Information Figure S1). The half time for the disappearance
of the untagged tetramers was 10.2 ± 3.5 and 2.3 ± 0.4 h
for WT and V122I TTR, respectively (Table 3). In agreement with this kinetic data, the half time for the formation
of the mixed heterotetramers (band 3, Supporting
Information Figure S1) was 12.5 ± 4.7 and 2.8 ± 0.6
h for the WT/FT2·WT and V122I/FT2·V122I
heterotetramers, respectively (Table 3). In
further analyses, we focused on the appearance of band 3 (heterotetramer
composed of 2 FT2 subunits and 2 untagged subunits) because,
in general, it gave us less variability than the quantification of
the disappearance of the homotetramers. This observation is probably
due to the fact that it is difficult to quantitate with precision
very faint bands like those of the homotetramers when the subunit
exchange reactions have reached completion.

Semi-native PAGE was used to quantify
tetrameric TTR stability in the presence of small molecules known
to bind in the T4 binding pocket and kinetically stabilize
tetrameric TTR against dissociation. We used this methodology to evaluate
the potency of SOM0226, a repurposed drug intended to be used as a
TTR kinetic stabilizer.18 First, we showed
that SOM0226 is able to prevent TTR aggregation in vitro under acid-mediated aggregation and in a fibril formation standard
assay (Figure 8). SOM0226 was able to prevent
WT TTR and V122I TTR fibril formation by 75 and 66%, respectively,
when tested at 1 mol equiv with respect to TTR and by 98% for both
WT and V122I TTR when tested at 2 mol equiv. These data demonstrate
that SOM0226 is a very potent inhibitor of TTR aggregation and fibril
formation in vitro.

Inhibition of TTR aggregation and fibril
formation by SOM0226.
WT TTR (a) and V122I TTR (b) at 4 μM were incubated at pH 4.4
for 3 days in the absence (DMSO, vehicle) or presence of SOM0226 (4
and 8 μM). Aggregation was measured by quantification of precipitated
protein (insoluble) and normalized to total soluble protein at time
0. Percentage of fibril formation inhibition by SOM0226 is shown on
the figure. Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t test: **** p < 0.0001.

We then evaluated the capacity of SOM0226 to prevent
WT and V122I
TTR subunit exchange in the semi-native PAGE system under physiological
conditions. At the same time, we tested tafamidis, an excellent inhibitor
of TTR fibril formation in vitro, which is currently
being used to treat TTR amyloidosis. We performed the experiments
in two settings: one in which only WT TTR was stabilized with the
small molecules before mixing it with nonstabilized FT2·WT TTR (asymmetrical) and the other in which both WT and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with the small molecules prior
to subunit exchange (symmetrical). We quantified the formation of
band 3 (the tetramer containing 2 WT subunits and 2 FT2·WT subunits, Figure 9). The same experiments
were done for V122I TTR/FT2·V122I TTR pairs (Supporting Information Figure S2).

Stabilization
of WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR by small
molecules measured by subunit exchange. WT TTR and FT2·WT
TTR were preincubated with SOM0226, tafamidis, or DMSO (vehicle control).
Mixtures of WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR with or without
small molecules were prepared and incubated for up to 48 h at 37 °C.
Subunit exchange rates were measured by quantifying the formation
of mixed heterotetramers composed of 2 WT and 2 FT2·WT
subunits (band 3, arrowhead). (a, c) Asymmetric mode where only WT
TTR was preincubated with small molecules; (b, d) symmetric mode where
both WT and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with small
molecules. Symbols: DMSO, diamonds; SOM0226, circles; tafamidis, triangles.

As expected, when both WT and
FT2·WT (or V122I
and FT2·V122I TTR) are stabilized with the drugs (symmetrical
setting, right panel), there is less subunit exchange than when only
the non-flag-tagged proteins were stabilized with the small molecule
(asymmetrical setting, left panel). These analyses also show that
the asymmetrical setting appears to be more sensitive to discern the
stabilization potency among small molecules. While in the symmetrical
setting the stabilization differences between SOM0226 and tafamidis
are distinguishable but small, it is clear in the asymmetrical setting
that SOM0226 is a more effective stabilizer than tafamidis.

Subunit exchange and semi-native PAGE were used to determine the
binding constants of SOM0226 with WT TTR and to evaluate cooperativity
between the two TTR T4 binding sites. WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with SOM0226 at 0, 0.25, 0.5,
1, 1.5, and 2 mol equiv, and subunit exchange was followed for 72
h incubation at 25 °C (Figure 10). We
quantified the appearance of band 3 (tetramer composed of 2 FT2 and 2 nontagged subunits), calculated the fraction of exchange
as detailed in the Experimental Procedures, and fit the data as in Penchala et al.23 and Bulawa et al.24 The best-fit exchange
rate constant is Kex = 0.28 ± 0.04
h–1; the ΔG1 for
SOM0226 binding to the first binding site is −10.1 ± 0.4
kcal/mol, which corresponds to a Kd1 =
41 nM, and the ΔG2 for binding to
the second binding site is −7.3 ± 1.0 kcal/mol, which
corresponds to a Kd2 = 4.3 μM. The
data are consistent with a negative cooperative mode of binding of
SOM0226 to WT TTR, which has also been described for tafamidis, diflunisal,
AG10 (another small molecule that binds and stabilizes TTR)23 and many other ligands.

### Aggregation and Fibril
Formation Propensity and Morphology of
FT2·TTR Variants Are Similar to Those of Untagged
TTR

TTR aggregation and amyloidogenesis can be induced in vitro by incubation under mildly acidic conditions.14,21 FT2·WT and FT2·V122I TTR together
with their nontagged counterparts (WT and V122I) were incubated for
1, 3, and 7 days at 37 °C and pH 4.4 (the pH of maximum aggregation
for both WT and V122I TTR). TTR aggregation was measured by quantification
of total protein precipitated, turbidity at 330 nm, and by thioflavin
T (ThT) binding fluorescence. The data show that FT2·TTR
variants have similar, albeit slightly higher (5–10%), aggregation
propensity as that of their nontagged counterparts when measured by
total protein precipitated (Figure 1a). Measurement
of aggregation by turbidity (Figure 1b) appears
to result in an increase of 5–42% in the FT2-proteins
compared to their nontagged counterparts. The differences are particularly
pronounced for FT2·WT TTR with respect to WT (24–42%
increase in turbidity). However, we have previously shown that turbidity
measurements give an estimate of aggregation, but, due to the different
morphologies of the aggregates, the values can substantially differ
between different TTR variants, even though the total aggregated protein
is the same.21 ThT fluorescence is an indicator
that amyloid species are formed in the aggregation reactions.25 Both FT2·WT and FT2·V122I TTR display ThT fluorescence upon aggregation, suggesting
that these proteins, as with their nontagged counterparts, form amyloid-like
aggregates (Figure 1c). In all cases, the ThT
signal for the FT2·TTR variants is lower than that
of the nontagged WT and V122I TTR (Figure 1c). It is known that not all the diverse TTR aggregate morphologies
bind ThT with the same efficiency.26 Our
data suggest that FT2·WT and FT2·V122I
TTR under acidic conditions might result in a distribution of aggregated
species that is in a small degree different from that of WT and V122I
TTR.

The extent of aggregation was measured by (a) percentage of insoluble
protein at each time point with respect to initial total (soluble)
protein, (b) turbidity at 330 nm, and (c) thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired
to
evaluate the morphologies of the TTR species in the acid-mediated
aggregation reactions (Figure 2). WT and V122I
TTR samples incubated for 1 day at 37 °C (panels a and c, respectively)
were characterized by the presence of elongated material (solid arrows)
as well as abundant small spherical aggregates (broken circles). The
samples also had thicker elongated deposits (arrow heads) and larger
amorphous aggregates (solid circles) that were more abundant in the
faster aggregating V122I TTR samples than in the WT TTR samples. For
FT2·WT TTR (1 day incubation, panel b), the grids
showed similar morphologies to those found in the WT TTR samples with
apparently more abundant small amorphous spherical aggregates (broken
circles). In contrast, the grids containing FT2·V122I
TTR (1 day incubation, panel d) were rich in very thin elongated material
(insert in panel d), but no thicker elongated deposits such as those
structures shown in panel c (solid arrows and arrow heads) were observed.
Samples incubated for 3 days at 37 °C (panels e–g) show
more abundant and thicker elongated material (arrowheads) than the
samples incubated for 1 day at 37 °C, indicating that the aggregation
process was still developing. For the FT2·V122I TTR
sample (panel h), we could see only the same structures as those found
after 1 day of incubation: small spherical aggregates and very thin
filaments (panel d). Only in the V122I TTR samples (panel g) did we
find twisted fibrils 200–250 nm long (left) and large amorphous
aggregates as those shown in panel g, right. We must note, however,
that most of the material from the samples incubated for 3 and 7 days
at 37 °C, especially those with V122I TTR variants, was characterized
by the presence of large and dense deposits opaque to TEM (not shown).

### FT2·TTR
Variants Have Similar Thermodynamic
Stability Compared to That of Their Nontagged Counterparts

Urea-mediated denaturation/renaturation curves were obtained to determine
the tetramer thermodynamic stability of FT2·WT and
FT2·V122I TTR with respect to that of WT and V122I
TTR. Previous studies have shown that urea cannot directly unfold
tetrameric TTR;27 the unfolding process,
like the aggregation process, requires rate-limiting tetramer dissociation
into its corresponding monomers, which is followed by monomer unfolding.
Thus, urea is a suitable chaotrope to estimate tetrameric TTR stability.

The loss of TTR quaternary structure was measured by resveratrol
fluorescence,22 which is known to bind
to and fluoresce only in the presence of tetrameric TTR and not in
the presence of monomeric TTR.21,22 Under the conditions
of the assay, resveratrol minimally perturbs the tetramer–monomer
equilibrium; thus, it is an appropriate probe to quantify the loss
of TTR quaternary structure upon incubation with urea.

The urea-induced
TTR tertiary structural changes (i.e., unfolding)
were measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, which allows the
quantification of the fraction of folded protein at any urea concentration.21,22,28 Given that in urea the limiting
step in the unfolding process is the tetramer disassembly, the rate
and extent of unfolding are measures of tetramer stability as well.14

Figure 3 shows
the unfolding and refolding
curves for the WT and V122I isoforms in urea. The data were fitted
by sigmoidal dose–response curves with variable slope. The
midpoint of the transitions between folded/unfolded (measured by tryptophan
fluorescence) or tetramer/nontetramer (measured by resveratrol binding
fluorescence) Cm (in molar units) was
calculated and are summarized in Table 1.

fluorescence; tetramer disassembly and reassembly were measured by
resveratrol-binding fluorescence.

the significant changes in Cm for the

Thermodynamic
stability curves of FT2·TTR and TTR
variants in urea. WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR (a–d)
and V122I TTR and FT2·V122I TTR (e–h) were
incubated in the presence of various concentrations of urea. The curves
were generated in the denaturation direction (a, c, e, g) starting
with folded proteins and in the renaturation direction (b, d, f, h)
starting with unfolded proteins. The amount of folded TTR at any given
urea concentration was measured by tryptophan fluorescence (a, b,
e, f), and the amount of tetrameric TTR at any given urea concentration
was measured by resveratrol fluorescence (c, d, g, h). WT TTR: solid
squares, solid lines; FT2·WT TTR: solid circles, broken
lines; V122I TTR: open squares, solid lines; FT2·V122I
TTR: open circles, broken lines. Data shown represents the average
of two independent experiments performed in triplicate (mean ±
SD).

For all proteins, the Cm values for
tetramer disassembly and reassembly are slightly lower than the Cm values for unfolding and refolding, consistent
with the notion that the tetramer must first dissociate before it
can unfold. In urea, tetramer disassembly and unfolding are processes
that take days and can vary substantially for different TTR variants.17 The refolding and tetramer reassembly processes
are much faster and are mostly complete in a matter of seconds.22 Thus, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium
is more easily reached from the unfolded state in the refolding/reassembly
reactions. This fact is reflected in Figure 3, where, in the denaturation direction, folded and tetrameric TTR
can still be detected at the time of measurement (96 h incubation
time). Longer incubation times in urea can result in urea-mediated
protein modification and are not desirable.29 Although the Cm values for the denaturation
and renaturation processes are similar, for the sake of clarity, we
will focus on the renaturation processes where thermodynamic equilibrium
has been reached.

The data show that the FT2·TTR
variants have slightly
lower Cm values than their nontagged counterparts
(Table 1), suggesting that appending FT2 at the N-terminus of the protein decreases, to some degree,
its thermodynamic stability. The effect appears to be more pronounced
for the V122I variant, for which the tetramer reassembly Cm values for V122I and FT2·V122I TTR are
3.0 and 2.6 M, respectively.

### FT2·TTR Variants Have Similar
Kinetic Stabilities
to Those of Their Nontagged Counterparts

We next studied
the kinetic stability of the FT2·TTR variants by measuring
the rates of denaturation. In our experience, measuring the rate of
unfolding by tryptophan fluorescence gives more robust data than measuring
the rate of tetramer dissociation by resveratrol fluorescence. Given
that tetramer dissociation is the limiting step of the overall unfolding
process, the rate of unfolding can be linked to the rate of tetramer
dissociation, as long as the urea concentration is high enough to
guarantee complete unfolding. Hammarström et al. validated
this notion by determining that monomeric TTR unfolding rate is ∼5
× 105 times faster than that of tetrameric TTR.14 Thus, we measured the rate of unfolding of the
FT2·TTR variants side-by-side with their nontagged
counterparts. We used urea concentrations that are in the post-transition
region for tertiary structural changes (i.e., >4.0 M urea), to
be
able to link tetramer disassembly and monomer unfolding (Figure 4). The dissociation time
courses fit best to a single-exponential curve over the range of urea
concentrations described by the equation I355/335= IN355/335 + A (1 – e–Kdiss.t), were IN355/335 is the native protein fluorescence intensity
ratio (355/335 nm), A is the amplitude change, Kdiss is the tetramer dissociation rate constant,
and t is the time in hours. Figure 4a shows the denaturation kinetic curves at 6 M urea. The natural
logarithm of the dissociation constants (Kdiss) change linearly with urea concentration14 (Figure 4b). This observation allows the
extrapolation of Kdiss to the more physiologic
0 M urea concentration (Table 2). The data, which represents the average of two
independent experiments, show that FT2·WT TTR has
the same kinetic stability as that of WT TTR within error, whereas
FT2·V122I TTR appears to be kinetically less stable
than V122I TTR. The estimated half time for dissociation (1/Kdiss) is in the range of 30–51 h for
WT and FT2·WT TTR, 19–25 h for V122I, and 15–17
h for FT2·V122I TTR (Table 2).

Kinetics of TTR dissociation measured by unfolding rates. (a) Unfolding
kinetics at 6 M urea measured by tryptophan fluorescence; data fitted
to one-phase association reactions. (b) Natural logarithm of the rate
of tetramer dissociation (ln Kdiss, h–1) plotted as a function of urea concentration. The
plots are linear, allowing the extrapolation of Kdiss to 0 M urea (Table 2). The
data correspond to the average of two independent experiments. WT
TTR: solid squares, solid lines; FT2·WT TTR: solid
circles, broken lines; V122I TTR: open squares, solid lines; FT2·V122I TTR: open circles, broken lines.

Kdiss is the dissociation rate constant
for the tetramer; mkin is the dependence
of Kdiss on urea concentration; t50 is the half
time for dissociation. Data extrapolated from dissociation curves
generated at several urea concentrations from two independent experiments
(Figure 4).

The fact that FT2-labeled proteins are
somewhat less
stable than their nontagged counterparts implies that there will always
be FT2·TTR subunits available to exchange with a nontagged
protein. The FT2-labeled proteins will not be limiting
the rate and extent at which the reactions take place, thus affording bona fide measurement of the stability of the TTR variant
under study.

### TTR Quaternary Structure Is Preserved under
Semi-Native PAGE
Conditions

WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR in Laemmli
sample buffer with or without a boiling step were analyzed in an 11%
PAGE system. In order to determine the size of the TTR species under
these analytical conditions, we also cross-linked one set of TTR samples
with glutaraldehyde. The cross-linked samples, with or without boiling,
were analyzed by PAGE in parallel lanes. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking
followed by PAGE is a well-established method to determine protein
quaternary structure.23,30 After electrophoretic separation,
the gels were developed by Sypro Ruby staining (Figure 5a). Boiled native TTR runs near the 15 kDa molecular weight
maker, consistent with the size of the monomer; boiled cross-linked
TTR runs mainly as a wide band near the 55–75 kDa markers,
consistent with the size of a tetramer. Bands of lower intensity with
the size of dimer and monomer can also be observed and probably reflect
the fact that glutaraldehyde cross-linking is not 100% efficient.
When the boiling step was omitted, TTR appeared near the 35 kDa marker
for WT TTR and near the 40 kDa marker for FT2·WT TTR
whether they were cross-linked or not, suggesting that the cross-linked
and non-cross-linked TTR species were of the same size. Glutaraldehyde
cross-linked TTR coelutes with native TTR in a calibrated gel filtration
Superdex 75 column (Figure 5b), indicating
that cross-linking preserves the TTR tetramer (and does not generate
larger species).

Analyses of TTR species by (a) PAGE and (b) size-exclusion
chromatography.
(a) WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR were analyzed on an 11%
PAGE gel under several conditions, including with or without denaturing
(boiling) before electrophoresis and with or without quaternary structure
fixation by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde before analysis. Denatured
(boiled) TTR runs near the 15 kDa marker (monomer size), cross-linked
and boiled TTR runs near 55–75KDa (tetramer size), and nondenatured
(nonboiled) TTR (cross-linked or not) runs near the 30–40 kDa
marker. (b) Size-exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Superdex
75 analytical column demonstrates that both WT TTR (solid lines) and
cross-linked WT TTR (dotted lines) have elution volumes consistent
with the size of a tetramer and no higher molecular weight species
are generated upon cross-linking.

Under standard PAGE conditions, the electrophoretic mobility
of
the proteins depends primarily on their molecular mass, whereas under
our semi-native PAGE conditions (unboiled samples), the mobility of
the proteins depends also on their shape and charge. This principle
may explain why the unboiled TTR samples (cross-linked or not) run
much faster through the gel than what is predicted from their molecular
weight (observed 35 kDa vs predicted 56 kDa). In these samples, TTR
is still folded and thus more compact compared to that in the boiled
TTR samples, which are denatured. The compact proteins move more freely
through the acrylamide mesh than the unfolded proteins, resulting
in bands with apparent lower molecular weight. Overall, the data demonstrate
that nonboiled native TTR runs as a tetramer in SDS-PAGE. We named
these conditions semi-native PAGE.

To further validate the notion
that under semi-native PAGE conditions
TTR runs as a tetramer, we used the small molecule resveratrol that,
by virtue of binding in the T4 binding pocket present only
in the native tetramer, becomes fluorescent. As mentioned above, resveratrol
does not bind to or fluoresce with monomeric TTR.22 The TTR samples analyzed by semi-native PAGE were as follows:
WT TTR, FT2·WT TTR, and an equimolar mixture of WT
and FT2·WT TTR that had been first unfolded in 6.5
M GndCl and then refolded to allow the formation of mixed heterotetramers.
A well-characterized TTR variant that is monomeric was also analyzed
as a control.20 After electrophoretic separation,
the gels were first stained with a 100 μM solution of resveratrol
(Figure 6, left panel) as detailed in the Experimental Procedures and then with Coomassie
blue to reveal all of the proteins in the gel (Figure 6, right panel). Figure 6 (resveratrol
staining) shows that the TTR variants run as tetramer under these
conditions because they are fluorescent; in contrast, the engineered
monomeric TTR variant (M-TTR) does not show resveratrol fluorescence.
Control gels in which the resveratrol solution was substituted by
DMSO (vehicle) display no fluorescence (not shown). We also measured
resveratrol fluorescence in the presence of WT TTR, S112I TTR (a recombinant
dimeric TTR variant),31 and the monomeric
M-TTR at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/mL. Only resveratrol
in the presence of WT tetrameric TTR displays fluorescence (not shown).
These results support the notion that in semi-native PAGE TTR runs
as a tetramer. Furthermore, it is clear from the gels shown in Figures 5 and 6 that FT2·TTR variants have much lower mobility than that of their nontagged
TTR counterparts. Samples consisting of unfolded/refolded equimolar
mixtures of WT TTR with FT2·TTR contain at least 3
resolved bands, in agreement with the presence of TTR heterotetramers.
Staining with the more sensitive Sypro Ruby dye clearly shows that
there are 5 bands forming upon subunit exchange (Figure 7), consistent with the formation of heterotetramers containing
0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 FT2-TTR subunits.

TTR species analyzed
by semi-native PAGE (nonboiled samples) and
visualized consecutively by resveratrol fluorescence staining (left
panel) and Coomassie staining (right panel). The samples analyzed
are WT TTR, FT2·WT TTR, an equimolar mixture of WT
TTR and FT2·WT TTR that had previously been unfolded
and refolded to allow the formation of mixed heterotetramers (labeled
WT/FT2·WT), and a well characterized engineered monomeric
TTR variant, M-TTR.20 When resveratrol
is bound to tetrameric TTR species, it is fluorescent, demonstrating
that semi-native PAGE conserves TTR tetrameric quaternary structure.

FT2·WT TTR incubated at 4, 25, and 37 °C for
different time periods (0–72 h). (a) Gels stained with Sypro
Ruby (arrowhead points to band 3). (b) Quantitation of the upper bands

of the TTR heterotetramer composed of two FT2·WT subunits
and two WT TTR subunits (band 3). Data representing quantitation of
the homotetramers (b, c) were normalized to band intensities at time
0; the data were fitted by one-phase decay curves. Data representing
quantitation of band 3 (d) were not normalized; the data were fitted
by one-phase association curves. Symbols: circles, 4 °C; squares,
25 °C; triangles, 37 °C.

All of our FT2·WT and FT2·V122I
TTR preparations have a small impurity whose mobility is consistent
with that of a homotetramer composed of 3 FT2-subunits
and one untagged subunit. We attribute it to a proteolysis event during
synthesis in E. coli. The presence
of this same impurity was also noticed in a recent paper describing
the use of TTR subunit exchange coupled to ultraperformance liquid
chromatography,32 where it was demonstrated
that it does not modify the kinetics of the subunit exchange reactions.

### Semi-native PAGE Can Be Used To Determine the Rate of TTR Subunit
Exchange with FT2·TTR under Physiological Conditions

Equal amounts of FT2·WT and WT TTR were mixed and
incubated over time at 4, 25, and 37 °C in buffer at pH 7.4.
The samples were then analyzed in duplicate by semi-native PAGE, and
the gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Figure 7). We quantified the disappearance of the bands corresponding to
FT2·WT homotetramer (top band, panel b) and WT homotetramer
(lower band, panel c) and the appearance of the most abundant heterotetramer
(middle band) consisting of 2 FT2·WT subunits and
2 WT subunits (band 3, panel d). The data were fitted by decreasing
(for FT2·WT and WT TTR disappearance) or increasing
(for heterotetramer formation, band 3) monoexponential equations;
the r2 values for the fits were >0.9.
The subunit exchange is faster at 4 °C than at 25 or 37 °C.
This observation is consistent with previous studies in which similar
TTR mixtures were analyzed by high-resolution ion exchange chromatography15 and is also in agreement with the notion that
there is a significant contribution from the hydrophobic effect on
TTR tetramer stability.14 We attribute
the faster disappearance of FT2·WT homotetramer compared
to that of the WT homotetramer at all temperatures to the fact that
the former is less stable than the latter (Figure 3 and Table 1).

We also compared
the subunit exchange rates between WT TTR and FT2·WT
TTR and the kinetically less stable V122I and FT2·V122I
TTR. As expected, V122I/FT2·V122I TTR exchanged subunits
much faster than WT/FT2·WT TTR (Supporting Information Figure S1). The half time for the disappearance
of the untagged tetramers was 10.2 ± 3.5 and 2.3 ± 0.4 h
for WT and V122I TTR, respectively (Table 3). In agreement with this kinetic data, the half time for the formation
of the mixed heterotetramers (band 3, Supporting
Information Figure S1) was 12.5 ± 4.7 and 2.8 ± 0.6
h for the WT/FT2·WT and V122I/FT2·V122I
heterotetramers, respectively (Table 3). In
further analyses, we focused on the appearance of band 3 (heterotetramer
composed of 2 FT2 subunits and 2 untagged subunits) because,
in general, it gave us less variability than the quantification of
the disappearance of the homotetramers. This observation is probably
due to the fact that it is difficult to quantitate with precision
very faint bands like those of the homotetramers when the subunit
exchange reactions have reached completion.

### Small Molecule-Mediated TTR Kinetic Stabilization
Can Be Determined
by Semi-Native PAGE

Semi-native PAGE was used to quantify
tetrameric TTR stability in the presence of small molecules known
to bind in the T4 binding pocket and kinetically stabilize
tetrameric TTR against dissociation. We used this methodology to evaluate
the potency of SOM0226, a repurposed drug intended to be used as a
TTR kinetic stabilizer.18 First, we showed
that SOM0226 is able to prevent TTR aggregation in vitro under acid-mediated aggregation and in a fibril formation standard
assay (Figure 8). SOM0226 was able to prevent
WT TTR and V122I TTR fibril formation by 75 and 66%, respectively,
when tested at 1 mol equiv with respect to TTR and by 98% for both
WT and V122I TTR when tested at 2 mol equiv. These data demonstrate
that SOM0226 is a very potent inhibitor of TTR aggregation and fibril
formation in vitro.

Inhibition of TTR aggregation and fibril
formation by SOM0226.
WT TTR (a) and V122I TTR (b) at 4 μM were incubated at pH 4.4
for 3 days in the absence (DMSO, vehicle) or presence of SOM0226 (4
and 8 μM). Aggregation was measured by quantification of precipitated
protein (insoluble) and normalized to total soluble protein at time
0. Percentage of fibril formation inhibition by SOM0226 is shown on
the figure. Statistical significance was calculated by Student’s t test: **** p < 0.0001.

We then evaluated the capacity of SOM0226 to prevent
WT and V122I
TTR subunit exchange in the semi-native PAGE system under physiological
conditions. At the same time, we tested tafamidis, an excellent inhibitor
of TTR fibril formation in vitro, which is currently
being used to treat TTR amyloidosis. We performed the experiments
in two settings: one in which only WT TTR was stabilized with the
small molecules before mixing it with nonstabilized FT2·WT TTR (asymmetrical) and the other in which both WT and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with the small molecules prior
to subunit exchange (symmetrical). We quantified the formation of
band 3 (the tetramer containing 2 WT subunits and 2 FT2·WT subunits, Figure 9). The same experiments
were done for V122I TTR/FT2·V122I TTR pairs (Supporting Information Figure S2).

Stabilization
of WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR by small
molecules measured by subunit exchange. WT TTR and FT2·WT
TTR were preincubated with SOM0226, tafamidis, or DMSO (vehicle control).
Mixtures of WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR with or without
small molecules were prepared and incubated for up to 48 h at 37 °C.
Subunit exchange rates were measured by quantifying the formation
of mixed heterotetramers composed of 2 WT and 2 FT2·WT
subunits (band 3, arrowhead). (a, c) Asymmetric mode where only WT
TTR was preincubated with small molecules; (b, d) symmetric mode where
both WT and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with small
molecules. Symbols: DMSO, diamonds; SOM0226, circles; tafamidis, triangles.

As expected, when both WT and
FT2·WT (or V122I
and FT2·V122I TTR) are stabilized with the drugs (symmetrical
setting, right panel), there is less subunit exchange than when only
the non-flag-tagged proteins were stabilized with the small molecule
(asymmetrical setting, left panel). These analyses also show that
the asymmetrical setting appears to be more sensitive to discern the
stabilization potency among small molecules. While in the symmetrical
setting the stabilization differences between SOM0226 and tafamidis
are distinguishable but small, it is clear in the asymmetrical setting
that SOM0226 is a more effective stabilizer than tafamidis.

Subunit exchange and semi-native PAGE were used to determine the
binding constants of SOM0226 with WT TTR and to evaluate cooperativity
between the two TTR T4 binding sites. WT TTR and FT2·WT TTR were preincubated with SOM0226 at 0, 0.25, 0.5,
1, 1.5, and 2 mol equiv, and subunit exchange was followed for 72
h incubation at 25 °C (Figure 10). We
quantified the appearance of band 3 (tetramer composed of 2 FT2 and 2 nontagged subunits), calculated the fraction of exchange
as detailed in the Experimental Procedures, and fit the data as in Penchala et al.23 and Bulawa et al.24 The best-fit exchange
rate constant is Kex = 0.28 ± 0.04
h–1; the ΔG1 for
SOM0226 binding to the first binding site is −10.1 ± 0.4
kcal/mol, which corresponds to a Kd1 =
41 nM, and the ΔG2 for binding to
the second binding site is −7.3 ± 1.0 kcal/mol, which
corresponds to a Kd2 = 4.3 μM. The
data are consistent with a negative cooperative mode of binding of
SOM0226 to WT TTR, which has also been described for tafamidis, diflunisal,
AG10 (another small molecule that binds and stabilizes TTR)23 and many other ligands.

### Discussion

In
the transthyretin amyloidoses the dissociation of the native
TTR tetramer is required and is the rate-limiting step in the aggregation
cascade.33−35 Kinetic stabilization of native tetrameric TTR is
an effective means to prevent amyloidogenesis in vitro and in vivo. TTR stabilization has been achieved in vivo genetically and pharmacologically. Genetically,
it has been observed that humans heterozygous for both the amyloidogenic
V30M TTR variant and the kinetically stable T119M TTR variant do not
develop FAP or manifest very mild symptoms.36 Their secreted TTR consists of heterotetramers with mixed V30M and
T119M subunits. Biophysical in vitro studies have
clearly demonstrated that the presence of a single T119M subunit in
the TTR heterotetramer prevents V30M amyloidogenicity by 50% and that
the aggregation propensity of a TTR heterotetramer composed of two
T119M subunits and two V30M TTR is completely abrogated.37 These observations underscore the importance
of studying quaternary protein structure to understand disease etiology.
Moreover, TTR isolated from plasma of V30M/T119M TTR heterozygotes
is more stable than that of V30M/WT TTR carriers.38 Pharmacologically, there are two small molecules, tafamidis
and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diflunisal, that have
undergone clinical trials as possible therapeutics to treat FAP. Tafamidis
is already approved in Europe and Japan for early-stage FAP treatment.
These small molecules bind in the T4 pocket of TTR, selectively
decreasing the energetic ground state of the tetramer and increasing
thus the energetic barrier for tetramer dissociation.

Most of
the studies of TTR aggregation in the absence or presence
of small molecules are done under nonphysiological conditions such
as acidic buffers or in the presence of methanol.14,34 In other instances, highly amyloidogenic TTR variants, not related
to clinical diseases, that can aggregate at physiological pH have
been generated to study the process of aggregation.39 Moreover, determination of TTR thermodynamic and kinetic
stabilities are typically established using chaotropes such as urea,
GndCl, or GndSCN to accelerate protein unfolding rates on convenient
laboratory time scales.14,15,21,22 In both fibrillogenesis and denaturation
assays, depletion of the substrate is occurring during the course
of the experiment because TTR either aggregates or dissociates/unfolds.
Furthermore, these nonphysiological conditions might have an impact
on how small molecules bind and stabilize the TTR tetramer or on how
the monomeric polypeptide chains interact to form the native tetramer.
For these reasons, it is difficult to predict the precise stability
of TTR under physiological conditions, either by itself or in the
presence of small molecules that kinetically stabilize the tetramer.

The use of subunit exchange methodology to study TTR stability
circumvents these limitations.15 The concentration
of TTR in solution is constant over time because there is no precipitation
or denaturation occurring during the course of the experiment. As
the TTR of interest exchanges subunits with FT2·TTR,
five different tetramers are generated containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and
4 FT2 subunits.15 To a first
approximation, the faster a TTR molecule exchanges subunits with FT2·TTR, the less stable it is. The implementation of this
methodology, however, has not been widespread, most likely because
of the need for high-resolution ion exchange chromatography systems
to quantify the subunit exchange reactions, which are not readily
available in most laboratories. Follow up applications of the methodology
suffer from the same drawback.16,23,32 Coupling subunit exchange reactions to semi-native PAGE analysis
overcomes this limitation.

With respect to the biophysical studies,
our data show that FT2·TTR variants have a similar
(although slightly higher)
aggregation propensity to that of their non-flag-tagged counterparts.
TEM imaging show the same type of morphologies for WT and FT2·WT TTR, although the relative proportions of each appeared
to be different in the grids examined. FT2·V122I TTR
differed from V122I TTR in that the elongated material deposited in
the grids was very thin. These morphological differences could explain
the higher turbidity observed in the FT2·WT samples
compared to that in WT TTR and the lower ThT fluorescence signal of
the two FT2 proteins compared to that of their native counterparts.
However, it is difficult to assign any specific effect to any particular
morphology because of the heterogeneous nature of the samples. It
is also noteworthy that the morphologies of the TTR aggregates obtained in vitro under acidic conditions appear to be very poor
in amyloid fibers. In our samples, only the faster aggregating V122I
TTR showed twisted 150–250 nm long structures that might represent
the so-called protofibrils (structures 4–11 nm in diameter
and ∼200 nm long). It is possible that longer periods of time
might be required to obtain TTR amyloid morphologies, but it could
also be the case that under acidic conditions the formation of fibrils per se is not favorable. More exhaustive and long-term studies
on aggregate morphology of TTR in vitro are consistent
with our observations.40 In these studies,
amyloid TTR fibrils from ex vivo tissues were also
visualized by TEM and shown to be several micrometers long. It is
known that in both tissues of patients with TTR amyloidosis and transgenic
mice overexpressing human WT TTR, amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates
are present in the deposits.41,42

Consistent with
the aggregation studies, the thermodynamic stability
of the FT2·WT TTR is comparable (albeit somewhat lower)
to that of WT TTR (Table 1). In previous studies
using GndSCN, FT2·WT TTR thermodynamic stability was
found to be identical to that of WT TTR.15 The thermodynamic stability of FT2·V122I TTR is
also lower than that of V122I TTR (Table 1).
The kinetic stabilities of the FT2-labeled proteins at
6 M urea appear to be lower than those of their unlabeled counterparts.
However, extrapolation of the kinetic data obtained at several urea
concentrations to 0 M urea shows that FT2·WT TTR has
the same kinetic stability as that of WT TTR, whereas FT2·V122I TTR is kinetically less stable than V122I TTR (Figure 4 and Table 2). That the FT2·TTR variants are of similar but lower stability to that
of their nontagged counterparts is, in fact, a desirable trait to
perform subunit exchange experiments since the tagged variants will
not be the limiting factor for the reactions to proceed. Our data
highlights the importance of using mild chaotropes such as urea, which
mimic the TTR amyloidogenic process (i.e., disassembly of the tetramer
before aggregation), to perform TTR stability studies.

We show
that subjecting TTR to semi-native PAGE conditions (nonboiled
samples) keeps the native TTR quaternary structure intact (Figures 5 and 6). A new methodology
developed herein for the purpose of defining the TTR quaternary structure
is the staining of the gels with resveratrol, a small molecule that
is fluorescent when it binds to the T4 binding pocket of
tetrameric TTR (Figure 6). We demonstrate that
semi-native PAGE can be used as a quantitative tool to define TTR
stability under physiological pH values. Our studies show that TTR
is less stable at 4 °C than at 25 or 37 °C, at pH 7.4 (Figure 7), which is consistent with previous studies15 and compatible with the notion that TTR stability
is governed by hydrophobic interactions, which are weaker at lower
temperatures.27 Our data also show that
V122I TTR exchanges subunits much faster than does WT TTR (Supporting Information Figure S1), which is in
agreement with its reported lower kinetic stability,43 as illustrated in Figure 4 and Table 2. These experiments demonstrate that subunit exchange
coupled with semi-native PAGE can be used to assess TTR quaternary
structure stability under physiological conditions.

We applied
the described methodology to quantify the TTR stabilization
effect of small molecules under physiological conditions. For that
we chose SOM0226, a repurposed drug candidate for the treatment of
FAP,18 and tafamidis. Subunit exchange
inhibition between non-flag-tagged TTR and FT2·TTR
was more efficient when both TTR variants were stabilized with the
small molecules (symmetrical setting) than when only the non-flag-tagged
protein was stabilized with the small molecules (asymmetrical setting)
before the subunit exchange reactions took place (Figure 9). The data also show that the asymmetrical setting
appears to be more sensitive at discriminating the TTR binding potency
of small molecules.

TTR has two T4 binding sites
located at the dimer–dimer
interface. Each TTR tetramer can, in principle, accommodate two small
molecules in its T4 sites. To study the affinity and the
mode of binding of small molecules to the TTR tetramer, techniques
such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance
(SPR), change in fluorescence polarization of a fluorescently labeled
TTR competing with a small molecule, or subunit exchange reactions
coupled to high-resolution ion exchange chromatography systems have
been employed.23,24,44 All of these techniques require expensive instrumentation, which
limits their broad applicability. We show that subunit exchange reactions
coupled with semi-native PAGE can be used to measure such interactions
and that the dissociation constants for binding of the small molecules
to TTR can be calculated. Our data obtained at 25 °C is consistent
with a negative cooperativity mode of binding of SOM0226 to WT TTR,
with a dissociation constant for the first binding site Kd1 = 41 nM and a dissociation constant for the second
binding site Kd2 = 4.3 μM. The calculated Kd1 for tafamidis using subunit exchange coupled
to high-resolution ion exchange chromatography (UPLC) is about 1 order
of magnitude below that of SOM0226 (4 nM), whereas the Kd2 value is ∼1 μM.23 The binding of SOM0226 and tafamidis to WT TTR are highly uncooperative.
The large difference between Kd1 and Kd2 in practical terms means that these small
molecules will mostly be bound to one single T4 site of
TTR rather than binding to both sites, resulting in more TTR molecules
being stabilized at a given concentration of the ligand. Because only
a single small molecule per tetramer is necessary to efficiently stabilize
TTR,45 this mode of binding allows lower
dosage for treatment of patients with TTR amyloidoses than if a small
molecule with cooperative binding was used. SOM0226 appears to be
a stronger stabilizer of WT TTR (and V122I TTR) than is tafamidis
(Figure 9 and Supporting
Information Figure S2), although its Kd1 to WT TTR is higher than that of tafamidis. This effect
could be due to an unusually high off rate of SOM0226 for the first
T4 binding site. If this is correct, once SOM0226 binds
in the TTR T4 pocket it will remain tightly bound to it
and it will hardly come off, resulting in a more efficiently stabilized
WT TTR tetramer.

There is substantial interest in developing
small molecules that
can prevent protein aggregation for a variety of protein misfolding
disorders by modulating the kinetics of the process.46 We believe that subunit exchange reactions coupled to semi-native
PAGE, such as that demonstrated for TTR, can be a simple and versatile
methodology to study oligomeric protein stability under physiological
conditions as well as for determining the potency of small molecules
to stabilize the native state. For that purpose, it will be necessary
to generate a tagged protein with similar stability to that of the
protein of interest but with different PAGE mobility. Although we
used the highly charged FT2 for our studies, we predict
that a noncharged tag that simply increases the molecular weight of
the complex might be sufficient to obtain the desired separation.
PAGE in the absence of SDS might be desirable if the oligomeric protein
of interest is not very stable. A protein such as the homodimeric
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), whose misfolding and aggregation is
related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),47 would be a perfect candidate to adapt this methodology,
particularly because SOD1, like TTR, is thermally very stable and
will probably maintain its quaternary structure under semi-native
PAGE conditions.48 Other protein misfolding
scenarios in which heterotypic interactions stabilize the native complex
might also be candidate systems to test this approach, provided that
appropriate tags that do not modify the interaction and the native
stability of the proteins can be developed.

In summary, we present
a new methodology to study TTR stability
and define the effect of small molecules as TTR kinetic stabilizers
as well as their mode of binding under physiological conditions. Our
results provide insights into the protein quaternary structure stabilization
by small molecules and therefore open new avenues for therapeutic
intervention in human amyloidogenic diseases. We suggest its application
to the study of other misfolding-prone proteins with quaternary structure
as well as heterotypic protein–protein interactions such as
those occurring in chaperone–client protein processes like
folding, refolding, assembly, or unfolding.
