## Cooperative Stabilization
of Transthyretin by Clusterin
and Diflunisal

### Abstract

The
circulating protein transthyretin (TTR) can unfold, oligomerize,
and form highly structured amyloid fibrils that are deposited in tissues,
causing organ damage and disease. This pathogenic process is caused
by a heritable TTR point mutation in cases of familial TTR-related
amyloidosis or wild-type TTR in cases of age-associated amyloidosis
(previously called senile systemic amyloidosis). The TTR amyloid cascade
is hypothesized to begin with the dissociation of the TTR native tetrameric
structure into folded but unstable monomeric TTR subunits. Unfolding
of monomeric TTR initiates an oligomerization process leading to aggregation
and fibril formation. Numerous proteostatic mechanisms for regulating
the TTR amyloid cascade exist. Extracellular chaperones provide an
innate defense against misfolded proteins. Clusterin (CLU), a plasma
protein, has the capacity to recognize exposed hydrophobic regions
of misfolded proteins, shielding them from aggregation. We have previously
demonstrated that CLU is associated with the amyloid fibrils in cardiac
tissues from patients with TTR amyloidosis. In this study, we have
used tetrameric and monomeric TTR structural variants to determine
the ability of CLU to inhibit TTR amyloid fibril formation. Using
circular dichroism spectroscopy, we determined that CLU preferentially
stabilizes monomeric TTR and generates increasingly stable conformations
under acid stress. Moreover, studies using surface plasmon resonance
showed a direct interaction of CLU with high-molecular weight TTR
oligomers. The interactions of CLU with monomeric and aggregated TTR
proceed in a cooperative manner in the presence of diflunisal, a small
molecule drug used to stabilize TTR tetramers.

### Experimental Procedures

Recombinant
TTR (rTTR) was expressed and purified using the method
described by Kingsbury et al.47 Modification
of the expression vector for rTTR variant synthesis was achieved via
site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Specifically, sequences were modified
for substitutions of leucine to proline at position 55 (L55P) to generate
an unstable tetrameric variant of rTTR. In addition, F87M and L110M
mutations were introduced to generate an engineered rTTR subunit that
reportedly does not form tetramers, termed monomeric rTTR (monoTTR,
F87M/L110M).30

A mouse
hybridoma cell line producing the G7 monoclonal IgG1 against
human serum CLU was received as a generous gift from L. A. Aarden
(The University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). An immunoaffinity
column was generated using covalent coupling of the G7 anti-human
CLU monoclonal IgG1 to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated
Sepharose 4B resin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All column procedures were
performed at 4 °C and protocols adapted from previously described
methods48 and personal communications from
M. R. Wilson (The University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia).
A multichannel peristaltic pump system using microcassettes and Masterflex
tubing #6424-14 (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) was set to a flow
rate of 0.5 mL/min (6 rpm) to deliver serum. One hundred milliliters
of pooled human serum collected from healthy male individuals (Bioreclamation
Inc., Westbury, NY) was quickly thawed at 37 °C and diluted 1:1
into PBS containing cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
Tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 5 mM EDTA. The diluted serum
was chilled on ice for 10 min, filtered, degassed, and then applied
to the G7 column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min (6 rpm). The G7 column
was washed extensively with PBS by gravity flow until the absorbance
at 280 nm of the eluate was ≤0.01. Removal of ApoA-I bound
to CLU was accomplished by washing with 0.5% Triton X-100 and extensive
rinsing. Next, a pre-elution washing step using 0.2 M sodium acetate
and 0.5 M NaCl (pH 5.0) was performed with extensive rinsing for stringent
purification of CLU. Serum CLU was eluted using 0.2 M glycine and
0.5 M NaCl (pH 2.5) and monitored by absorbance measurements at 280
nm. Purified CLU fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS (pH
7.4).

It has been demonstrated that, at physiologic concentrations, wt
TTR tetramer is resistant to dissociation between pH 7.0 and 5.0.49 We used acid-mediated aggregation assays for
generation of wt, L55P, and monomeric (F87M/L110M) rTTR oligomers
and amyloid fibrils described herein. For oligomer formation, wt rTTR
(3.6 μM) was dialyzed at 4 °C against ddH2O
for 24 h and then against 10 mM HCl (pH 2.0) for 96 h. Production
of oligomers was initiated by addition of NaCl adjusted to a concentration
of 100 mM at 25 °C.50 Neutralization
of the oligomerization reaction was achieved using a 1:6 dilution
of 0.5 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4). For amyloid fibril
formation, wt and L55P tetrameric variants were dialyzed in separate
assays against 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 100 mM KCl
(pH 7.1) overnight at 4 °C. Monomeric rTTR was buffer exchanged
rapidly into 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 100 mM KCl (pH
7.1) using Econo-Pac 10DG columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to preserve
protein stability. Recombinant TTR protein solutions were quantified
by a bicinchoninic acid assay and diluted to 7.2 μM. Treatments
of rTTR with diflunisal at 100 M excess or CLU or bovine serum albumin
(BSA) at 7.2 μM (equimolar ratio with respect to rTTR) were
conducted for 2 h at room temperature and neutral pH. Subsequently,
rTTR solutions were diluted 1:1 into 200 mM potassium acetate, 100
mM potassium chloride, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 5.0) and incubated at 37 °C
for up to 14 days.

CD spectra were recorded
using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with thermoelectric
temperature controllers (Jasco Inc.). Far-UV (193–250 nm, 1
nm bandwidth) data were collected using a 1.0 mm path length quartz
cell, smoothed with the Jasco noise reduction routine, normalized
to protein concentration, and presented as mean residue molar ellipticity
(MRE) for individual proteins. For protein mixtures, ellipticity data
are presented as CD signals in millidegrees. CD melting and stability
data were recorded at 220 nm while samples were heated at a constant
rate from 25 to 98 °C. Melting temperatures (Tm) were determined from peak positions in the first derivative
of the CD melting curves.51

Samples were cross-linked for
2 min with 5 μL of 25% glutaraldehyde, and the reaction was
quenched with 5 μL of 7% NaBH4; 12.5 μL of
6× SDS reducing Laemmli load buffer was added to each reaction
solution and the mixture boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed using
10% SDS–PAGE developed for 2 h using GelCode blue Coomassie
blue G-250 reagent (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL).

A ProteOn XPR36 surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) apparatus and sensor chips (Bio-Rad) were used for
this study. Wild-type tetramers and HMW oligomers of rTTR were each
separately immobilized on a GLH high-capacity sensor chip for studies
of diflunisal and Congo red binding and on a GLM medium-capacity sensor
chip for analysis of CLU binding. The rTTR ligands were immobilized
using an amine coupling reaction; 2 μM rTTR ligand samples were
diluted in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and injected over the activated
sensor chip surface for 5 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. A
reference surface was always prepared in parallel using the same immobilization
procedure in the absence of ligand. Final ligand immobilization levels
achieved for GLH surfaces were as follows: native rTTR tetramer, 11000
resonance units (RU); 24 h HMW oligomers, 5100 RU. For GLM surfaces,
the levels were as follows: native rTTR tetramer, 5800 RU; 24 h HMW
oligomers, 4300 RU. In this system, 1 RU = 1 pg of protein/mm2. Diflunisal, Congo red, and CLU analytes were injected over
immobilized rTTR ligands; diflunisal and Congo red samples were injected
for 1–2 min at a flow rate of 100 μL/min, and CLU was
injected for 5 min at a flow rate of 50 μL/min. PBS (pH 7.4)
and 0.005% Tween 20 were used as running buffer and analyte diluent.
Sensorgrams were double referenced to blank ligand surfaces and blank
analyte buffer injections; data were modeled using the conservative
Langmuir 1:1 (analyte:ligand) interaction model.

Insoluble rTTR amyloid fibrils were
collected by centrifugation at 25000g for 5 min,
and the supernatant was removed. For polarized light microscopy, pelleted
fibrils were suspended in low-melt agarose (Thermo Fisher), formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded, serially sectioned to thicknesses of 5 μm,
and processed for Congo red staining. Deparaffinized sections were
placed in an alkaline 80% alcohol/NaCl mixture for 20 min, stained
with alkaline Congo red for 20 min, rinsed in ethanol and xylene,
and observed by light microscopy using bright and polarized views.

For determination of the amount of bound Congo red in solution,
pelleted fibrils were resuspended in 10 μM Congo red, 150 mM
NaCl, and 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) to a final volume
of 500 μL. Spectrophotometric scanning in the wavelength (λ)
range between 350 and 700 nm was performed using a Cary 300 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for quantification
of binding of Congo red to amyloid structures in suspension. A red-shift
of the Congo red spectrum in the wavelength range near 540 nm indicated
the presence of amyloid, and bound Congo red concentrations were determined
as previously described.52,53

### Expression
and Purification of Recombinant Transthyretin

Recombinant
TTR (rTTR) was expressed and purified using the method
described by Kingsbury et al.47 Modification
of the expression vector for rTTR variant synthesis was achieved via
site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis

### Serum Clusterin Immunoaffinity
Purification

A mouse
hybridoma cell line producing the G7 monoclonal IgG1 against
human serum CLU was received as a generous gift from L. A. Aarden
(The University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). An immunoaffinity
column was generated using covalent coupling of the G7 anti-human
CLU monoclonal IgG1 to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated
Sepharose 4B resin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All column procedures were
performed at 4 °C and protocols adapted from previously described

0.5 M NaCl (pH 2.5) and monitored by absorbance measurements at 280
nm. Purified CLU fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS (pH
7.4).

### Acid-Mediated Transthyretin Oligomer and Amyloid Fibril Formation

It has been demonstrated that, at physiologic concentrations, wt
TTR tetramer is resistant to dissociation between pH 7.0 and 5.0.49 We used acid-mediated aggregation assays for
generation of wt, L55P, and monomeric (F87M/L110M) rTTR oligomers
and amyloid fibrils described herein. For oligomer formation, wt rTTR
(3.6 μM) was dialyzed at 4 °C against ddH2O
for 24 h and then against 10 mM HCl (pH 2.0) for 96 h. Production
of oligomers was initiated by addition of NaCl adjusted to a concentration
of 100 mM at 25 °C.50 Neutralization
of the oligomerization reaction was achieved using a 1:6 dilution
of 0.5 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4). For amyloid fibril
formation, wt and L55P tetrameric variants were dialyzed in separate
assays against 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 100 mM KCl
(pH 7.1) overnight at 4 °C. Monomeric rTTR was buffer exchanged
rapidly into 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 100 mM KCl (pH
7.1) using Econo-Pac 10DG columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to preserve
protein stability. Recombinant TTR protein solutions were quantified
by a bicinchoninic acid assay and diluted to 7.2 μM. Treatments
of rTTR with diflunisal at 100 M excess or CLU or bovine serum albumin
(BSA) at 7.2 μM (equimolar ratio with respect to rTTR) were
conducted for 2 h at room temperature and neutral pH. Subsequently,
rTTR solutions were diluted 1:1 into 200 mM potassium acetate, 100
mM potassium chloride, and 2 mM EDTA (pH 5.0) and incubated at 37 °C
for up to 14 days.

### Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy

CD spectra were recorded
using a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with thermoelectric
temperature controllers (Jasco Inc.). Far-UV (193–250 nm, 1
nm bandwidth) data were collected using a 1.0 mm path length quartz
cell, smoothed with the Jasco noise reduction routine, normalized
to protein concentration, and presented as mean residue molar ellipticity
(MRE) for individual proteins. For protein mixtures, ellipticity data
are presented as CD signals in millidegrees. CD melting and stability
data were recorded at 220 nm while samples were heated at a constant
rate from 25 to 98 °C. Melting temperatures (Tm) were determined from peak positions in the first derivative
of the CD melting curves.51

### Sodium Dodecyl
Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) Analysis

Samples were cross-linked for
2 min with 5 μL of 25% glutaraldehyde, and the reaction was
quenched with 5 μL of 7% NaBH4; 12.5 μL of
6× SDS reducing Laemmli load buffer was added to each reaction
solution and the mixture boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed using
10% SDS–PAGE developed for 2 h using GelCode blue Coomassie
blue G-250 reagent (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL).

### Surface Plasmon
Resonance

A ProteOn XPR36 surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) apparatus and sensor chips (Bio-Rad) were used for
this study. Wild-type tetramers and HMW oligomers of rTTR were each
separately immobilized on a GLH high-capacity sensor chip for studies
of diflunisal and Congo red binding and on a GLM medium-capacity sensor
chip for analysis of CLU binding. The rTTR ligands were immobilized
using an amine coupling reaction; 2 μM rTTR ligand samples were
diluted in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and injected over the activated
sensor chip surface for 5 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. A
reference surface was always prepared in parallel using the same immobilization
procedure in the absence of ligand. Final ligand immobilization levels
achieved for GLH surfaces were as follows: native rTTR tetramer, 11000
resonance units (RU); 24 h HMW oligomers, 5100 RU. For GLM surfaces,
the levels were as follows: native rTTR tetramer, 5800 RU; 24 h HMW
oligomers, 4300 RU. In this system, 1 RU = 1 pg of protein/mm2. Diflunisal, Congo red, and CLU analytes were injected over
immobilized rTTR ligands; diflunisal and Congo red samples were injected
for 1–2 min at a flow rate of 100 μL/min, and CLU was
injected for 5 min at a flow rate of 50 μL/min. PBS (pH 7.4)
and 0.005% Tween 20 were used as running buffer and analyte diluent.
Sensorgrams were double referenced to blank ligand surfaces and blank
analyte buffer injections; data were modeled using the conservative
Langmuir 1:1 (analyte:ligand) interaction model.

### Congo Red Binding

Insoluble rTTR amyloid fibrils were
collected by centrifugation at 25000g for 5 min,
and the supernatant was removed. For polarized light microscopy, pelleted
fibrils were suspended in low-melt agarose (Thermo Fisher), formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded, serially sectioned to thicknesses of 5 μm,
and processed for Congo red staining. Deparaffinized sections were
placed in an alkaline 80% alcohol/NaCl mixture for 20 min, stained
with alkaline Congo red for 20 min, rinsed in ethanol and xylene,
and observed by light microscopy using bright and polarized views.

For determination of the amount of bound Congo red in solution,
pelleted fibrils were resuspended in 10 μM Congo red, 150 mM
NaCl, and 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) to a final volume
of 500 μL. Spectrophotometric scanning in the wavelength (λ)
range between 350 and 700 nm was performed using a Cary 300 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) for quantification
of binding of Congo red to amyloid structures in suspension. A red-shift
of the Congo red spectrum in the wavelength range near 540 nm indicated
the presence of amyloid, and bound Congo red concentrations were determined
as previously described.52,53

### Results

TTR amyloidogenesis
is promoted by tetramer-destabilizing amino acid substitutions. To
investigate the effects of CLU and diflunisal on the steps of TTR
unfolding and aggregation, we utilized rTTR, wt and two variants.
The mutant proteins included L55P, a highly amyloidogenic variant
found in ATTRm patients with early onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy,
and F87M/L110M (monoTTR), an engineered variant that is present mostly
in monomeric form at neutral pH.30 Purified
rTTR proteins were rich in β-sheet content as assessed by far-UV
CD (Figure 1A). The observed CD spectra after
pH 5.0 buffer adjustment (Figure 1A) did not
differ from spectra observed at pH 7.0 (data not shown). When quaternary
structures were analyzed by chemical cross-linking and gel electrophoresis,
wt and L55P at 3.6 μM occurred mainly as 56 kDa forms corresponding
to tetrameric TTR; while minor amounts of dimeric TTR (∼30
kDa) were also observed, little to no monomeric (14 kDa) protein was
noted (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 3). The most
abundant form of cross-linked monoTTR appeared at an electrophoretic
migration end point consistent with TTR monomer (14 kDa); minor amounts
of dimer (∼30 kDa) were also noted (Figure 1B, lane 2).

Structural and thermal stability analyses of wild-type
transthyretin
(TTR), variant TTR, and clusterin (CLU) proteins monitored by circular
dichroism (CD) and electrophoretic migration. (A) Far-UV CD spectra
of wtTTR (black), L55P TTR (green), and monomeric F87M/L110M TTR (monoTTR,
red). (B) Glutaraldehyde cross-linked rTTR samples with 25 μL
of 3.57 μM protein loaded into each lane and analyzed by SDS–PAGE
with Coomassie staining. (C) rTTR thermal stability determined by
continuous CD monitoring at 220 nm while the samples were heated at
a rate of 2 °C/min. Far-UV CD spectra of monomeric rTTR (inset
of panel C) and CLU (inset of panel D) recorded at 25 °C before
thermal stress (solid lines) and at 98 °C (dashed lines) after
heating. Protein concentrations were 3.6 μM in 5 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM potassium acetate, and 50 mM potassium chloride
(pH 5.0).

CD analysis was used to assess
the thermal stabilities of wt, L55P,
and monomeric rTTR upon heating of the proteins from 25 to 98 °C
(Figure 1C). A pH of 5.0 was chosen to ensure
both L55P tetramer dissociation and monomer unfolding. These conditions
also preserve CLU functionality.54 Far-UV
CD spectra were obtained for monoTTR and CLU at 25 °C (solid
lines) and heated to 98 °C (dashed lines, Figure 1C,D, inset in each panel). The native β-sheet rich structure
of monoTTR and α-helix structure of CLU are partially lost upon
heating of the proteins to 98 °C. A wavelength of 220 nm was
chosen for monitoring changes in secondary structure during thermal
unfolding.

The thermal stabilities of rTTR proteins corresponded
to the presence
of amino acid substitutions and quaternary structure (Figure 1C); wt was most stable, L55P intermediate, and monoTTR
least stable. For wt TTR [Figure 1C (black
circles)], no loss of secondary structure was observed upon protein
heating; this was consistent with a Tm reported to be >100 °C.55 L55P
TTR
[Figure 1C (green diamonds)] began to unfold
at 65 °C; however, the unfolding was incomplete as no plateau
was reached before 100 °C. MonoTTR [Figure 1C (red triangles)] displayed a complete transition with a Tm of 60 °C. CLU showed a single sigmoidal
transition with a Tm at 48 °C (Figure 1D).

Next, we tested whether
CLU affects structural transitions of tetrameric and monomeric forms
of rTTR upon heating. Data from the observed thermal unfolding of
equimolar rTTR/CLU mixtures were used to generate individual melting
curves and compared to the calculated summed values (Figure 2). The summed melting curves (filled black circles)
are the additive spectral changes of each protein, independently acquired
and generated by spectral composite computation. For wtTTR/CLU mixtures,
summed (filled circles) and observed (open circles) thermal unfolding
profiles exhibited nearly identical melt transitions (Figure 2A). The L55P TTR/CLU summed and observed melting
comparison showed a small but distinct deviation in the CD signal
at 220 nm (Figure 2B). For the monoTTR/CLU
mixture, the summed (black circles) and observed (red triangles) melting
data showed a considerable divergence beginning at 45 °C (Figure 2C), leading to a loss of secondary structure in
the monoTTR/CLU mixture. This result was substantially smaller than
the calculated sum of CD signals from individual proteins, suggesting
a distinct stabilization effect of CLU on the secondary structure
of monoTTR.

Comparison of thermal unfolding data for equimolar mixtures of
transthyretin (TTR) variants with clusterin (CLU). Secondary structural
changes of each rTTR/CLU mixture during heating at a rate of 2 °C/min
were obtained by continuous monitoring of the CD signal at 220 nm.
Observed melting curves for equimolar mixtures of (A) wt, (B) L55P,
and (C) monoTTR with CLU are shown as open black circles, green diamonds,
and red triangles, respectively; each data set was compared to the
corresponding sum of melting curves from the individual proteins (filled
black circles). (D) Data from a direct comparison of observed melting
curves for equimolar mixtures of CLU and wt, L55P, or monomeric rTTR
are shown as open black circles, green diamonds, or red triangles,
respectively.

Direct comparisons of
observed melting data for TTR/CLU mixtures
were also examined (Figure 2D). The wtTTR/CLU
(black circles) and L55P TTR/CLU (green diamonds) mixtures showed
similar unfolding of CLU at a Tm of 48
°C; the monoTTR/CLU mixture (red triangles) exhibited less change
in secondary structure for this low-temperature transition. Two distinct
transitions were evident in the melting curves of L55P TTR/CLU and
monoTTR/CLU mixtures; however, only in the monoTTR/CLU sample was
there a completed second transition demonstrated by a plateau in the
curve above 90 °C. The higher-Tm transition
in the L55P TTR/CLU mixture corresponded to the L55P tetramer melt
transition observed in Figure 1C.

To
compare the thermal unfolding of monoTTR, CLU, and the monoTTR/CLU
mixture, the data were scaled together (Figure 3). CLU (filled blue squares) and the monoTTR/CLU mixture (open red
triangles) showed identical low-Tm transitions
corresponding to CLU unfolding [Tm = 48
°C (vertical dashed line)]. Interestingly, the monoTTR/CLU mixture
had a unique Tm transition above 80 °C
that was not observed in individual samples of monoTTR or CLU. The
higher-Tm transition of the monoTTR/CLU
mixture indicated retention of secondary structure by the proteins
in the mixture (vertical dashed line). Midpoint transition temperatures
determined from peak positions in the first derivatives of the CD
data further illustrated the presence of a high-Tm transition for the monoTTR/CLU mixture (Figure 3B). Apparent Tm values
were 48 °C for CLU, 60 °C for monoTTR, and 47 and ∼80
°C and higher for the monoTTR/CLU mixture. The unique Tm transition above 80 °C was shown to be
a rate-dependent process with a shifted melting transition and greater
structural change observed under slower thermal stress conditions
(Figure 3C). Reversibility assessment indicated
that unfolding of L55P TTR and monoTTR was irreversible (data not
shown). Interestingly, while unfolding of the L55P TTR/CLU mixture
was partially reversible, results from our studies of the monoTTR/CLU
mixture indicated a completely reversible unfolding–folding
phenomenon.

Effect of clusterin on thermal unfolding of transthyretin (TTR)
monomers. (A) Thermal unfolding profiles for monoTTR, CLU, and an
equimolar mixture of the proteins were constructed from CD data recorded
at 220 nm with samples heated continuously at a rate of 2 °C/min.
The apparent melting temperatures (Tm)
for samples, indicated by vertical dashed lines, were determined from
peak maxima obtained from first-derivative calculations (B) of the
melting data. CLU alone (blue squares) and the monoTTR/CLU mixture
(open red triangles) exhibit similar lower-temperature structural
transitions (Tm values of 48 and 47 °C,
respectively) and a plateau at ∼60 °C. MonoTTR alone (filled
red triangles) exhibits a single structural transition with a Tm of 60 °C and a plateau at ∼80
°C. The monoTTR/CLU mixture also displays a second unique, higher-temperature
structural transition (>80 °C). (C) Comparison of monoTTR/CLU
mixture unfolding curves recorded at fast (2 °C/min) and slow
(0.1 °C/min) heating rates, showing a rate-dependent shift in
the high-temperature (>80 °C) melting transition.

We tested the ability
of CLU to directly interact with oligomeric forms of rTTR. Wild-type
rTTR oligomers were generated at pH 2.0 by rapid aggregation initiated
upon addition of NaCl after rTTR unfolding; by 60 min, all tetrameric
rTTR was transformed into oligomers with a molecular weight of >200
kDa [high-molecular weight (HMW)] and monomers (Figure 4A). Wild-type rTTR secondary structural changes during oligomerization
were monitored using CD (Figure 4B). A loss
of native β-sheet content, as seen in the wtTTR native sample
(black line), and a transition to random-coil conformation occurred
at pH 2.0 (wtTTR acid denatured, dashed red line). A subsequent transition
to β-sheet structure and accumulation of β-sheet content
over time were observed, indicating conformational conversion of the
rTTR during oligomerization. Light microscopic examination of precipitated
rTTR after a 14 day incubation under acidic conditions showed Congo
red binding and amyloid fibril specific apple-green birefringence
when viewed under standard and polarized light, respectively (Figure 4C,D).

at various time points during the acid-mediated oligomer formation
assay, were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde and analyzed by SDS–PAGE.

min, and 17 h) from a single continuous reaction mixture showing secondary

microscopy of rTTR amyloid fibrils, formed after 2 weeks in the acid-mediated
assay, stained with Congo red, and viewed under bright (C) and polarized
(D) light. Arrows indicate wt rTTR amyloid fibrils.

SPR biosensor detection was used to characterize
surfaces to which
the previously described native or oligomeric forms of wt rTTR had
been covalently bound. We used diflunisal and Congo red to determine
the structural nature of rTTR-modified surfaces (Figure 5). The native rTTR surface demonstrated substantial diflunisal
binding (0–60 s injection) and negligible Congo red binding
(0–120 s injection), indicating intact TTR tetrameric structure
(Figure 5A,B, gray lines) as measured by a
change in response units (RU) in the SPR sensorgrams. An observed
decrease in the level of diflunisal binding (Figure 5A, black line) with a corresponding marked increase in the
level of Congo red binding (Figure 5B, black
line) of HMW TTR surfaces was also measured. Serum-purified CLU was
passed over the native and HMW TTR surfaces (panels C and D of Figure 5, respectively). Concentration-dependent binding
of CLU to the HMW TTR surface was observed during the injection (0–300
s) phase (Figure 5D). No CLU binding took place
with the native TTR surface (Figure 5C). It
is important to note that the CLU binding sensorgrams demonstrate
a concentration-dependent increase in magnitude that was consistent
with the increased accumulated mass of CLU during the injection phase.
In addition, the dissociation phase beginning at 300 s (vertical dashed
line) was quite slow, indicating that the CLU–HMW TTR interactions
at the SPR chip surface were more stable than interactions of TTR
with diflunisal and Congo red.

nM (red line) over (C) native and (D) HMW oligomeric wt TTR surfaces
are shown. Analyte injection periods begin at 0 s with vertical dashed
lines marking the end of injection periods. CLU–HMW TTR sensorgram
data were fit using a conservative Langmuir 1:1 (analyte:ligand) interaction
model (D, black lines).

Finally, we investigated the ability of CLU, diflunisal, and a
combination of the two to inhibit wt, L55P, and monomeric rTTR amyloid
fibril formation under mildly acidic conditions. Interestingly, monoTTR
in the presence of diflunisal, at neutral pH incubated for 2 h, showed
enhanced dimerization and forced tetramer formation (Figure 6). After a 10 day incubation period, amyloid fibril
formation reaction end points were measured using the quantitative
Congo red binding spectral shift method.53 As wt TTR tetramer is stable at pH 5.0, the spectral absorbance
characteristics of wt rTTR reactions were nearly identical to those
of Congo red alone, indicating no fibril formation. However, L55P
and monomeric rTTR end point reactions showed significant amyloid
formation as indicated by increased amounts of Congo red bound in
solution (Figure 7A,B). For L55P, a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test differences among treatments
with diflunisal, CLU, a combination of the two, and BSA as a negative
control for the reaction (Figure 7A; F = 46.77; p = 0.0004). Tukey post hoc
comparisons of the treatments indicate that diflunisal (n = 2; no bound Congo red indicated), CLU [n = 2; M = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) from −0.76
to 1.81], and diflunisal with CLU (n = 2; no bound
Congo red indicated) yielded bound Congo red concentrations significantly
lower than those with untreated L55P (n = 2; M = 1.57; 95% CI from 0.54 to 2.59) and L55P TTR with BSA
(n = 2; M = 1.77; 95% CI from −1.35
to 4.89). For the monomer, a one-way ANOVA was used to test differences
among treatments with diflunisal, CLU, a combination of the two, and
BSA (Figure 7B; F = 407.9; p < 0.0001). Tukey post hoc comparisons of the treatments
indicate that CLU (n = 3; M = 1.54;
95% CI from 1.27 to 1.81), and diflunisal with CLU (n = 3; M = 1.04; 95% CI from 0.92 to 1.15) resulted
in amounts of bound Congo red significantly smaller than those with
untreated monomer (n = 3; M = 2.64;
95% CI from 2.42 to 2.87) or monomer with BSA (n =
3; M = 2.82; 95% CI from 2.74 to 2.89). Additionally,
amounts of bound Congo red in the combination treatments of monomer
with diflunisal and CLU were significantly smaller than those for
the treatment with only CLU (p < 0.001).

formation as wt tetramer is stable at pH 5.0 (data not shown). Data
were background subtracted with respect to amount of Congo red bound

and ***p < 0.001.

### Secondary and
Quaternary Structure, and Thermal Stability of
Transthyretin Correspond to Mutational Status

TTR amyloidogenesis
is promoted by tetramer-destabilizing amino acid substitutions. To
investigate the effects of CLU and diflunisal on the steps of TTR
unfolding and aggregation, we utilized rTTR, wt and two variants.
The mutant proteins included L55P, a highly amyloidogenic variant
found in ATTRm patients with early onset familial amyloid polyneuropathy,
and F87M/L110M (monoTTR), an engineered variant that is present mostly
in monomeric form at neutral pH.30 Purified
rTTR proteins were rich in β-sheet content as assessed by far-UV
CD (Figure 1A). The observed CD spectra after
pH 5.0 buffer adjustment (Figure 1A) did not
differ from spectra observed at pH 7.0 (data not shown). When quaternary
structures were analyzed by chemical cross-linking and gel electrophoresis,
wt and L55P at 3.6 μM occurred mainly as 56 kDa forms corresponding
to tetrameric TTR; while minor amounts of dimeric TTR (∼30
kDa) were also observed, little to no monomeric (14 kDa) protein was
noted (Figure 1B, lanes 1 and 3). The most
abundant form of cross-linked monoTTR appeared at an electrophoretic
migration end point consistent with TTR monomer (14 kDa); minor amounts
of dimer (∼30 kDa) were also noted (Figure 1B, lane 2).

Structural and thermal stability analyses of wild-type
transthyretin
(TTR), variant TTR, and clusterin (CLU) proteins monitored by circular
dichroism (CD) and electrophoretic migration. (A) Far-UV CD spectra
of wtTTR (black), L55P TTR (green), and monomeric F87M/L110M TTR (monoTTR,
red). (B) Glutaraldehyde cross-linked rTTR samples with 25 μL
of 3.57 μM protein loaded into each lane and analyzed by SDS–PAGE
with Coomassie staining. (C) rTTR thermal stability determined by
continuous CD monitoring at 220 nm while the samples were heated at
a rate of 2 °C/min. Far-UV CD spectra of monomeric rTTR (inset
of panel C) and CLU (inset of panel D) recorded at 25 °C before
thermal stress (solid lines) and at 98 °C (dashed lines) after
heating. Protein concentrations were 3.6 μM in 5 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM potassium acetate, and 50 mM potassium chloride
(pH 5.0).

CD analysis was used to assess
the thermal stabilities of wt, L55P,
and monomeric rTTR upon heating of the proteins from 25 to 98 °C
(Figure 1C). A pH of 5.0 was chosen to ensure
both L55P tetramer dissociation and monomer unfolding. These conditions
also preserve CLU functionality.54 Far-UV
CD spectra were obtained for monoTTR and CLU at 25 °C (solid
lines) and heated to 98 °C (dashed lines, Figure 1C,D, inset in each panel). The native β-sheet rich structure
of monoTTR and α-helix structure of CLU are partially lost upon
heating of the proteins to 98 °C. A wavelength of 220 nm was
chosen for monitoring changes in secondary structure during thermal
unfolding.

The thermal stabilities of rTTR proteins corresponded
to the presence
of amino acid substitutions and quaternary structure (Figure 1C); wt was most stable, L55P intermediate, and monoTTR
least stable. For wt TTR [Figure 1C (black
circles)], no loss of secondary structure was observed upon protein
heating; this was consistent with a Tm reported to be >100 °C.55 L55P
TTR
[Figure 1C (green diamonds)] began to unfold
at 65 °C; however, the unfolding was incomplete as no plateau
was reached before 100 °C. MonoTTR [Figure 1C (red triangles)] displayed a complete transition with a Tm of 60 °C. CLU showed a single sigmoidal
transition with a Tm at 48 °C (Figure 1D).

### Clusterin Preferentially Stabilizes TTR Monomeric
Structures
Forming Thermally Resistant Complexes

Next, we tested whether
CLU affects structural transitions of tetrameric and monomeric forms
of rTTR upon heating. Data from the observed thermal unfolding of
equimolar rTTR/CLU mixtures were used to generate individual melting
curves and compared to the calculated summed values (Figure 2). The summed melting curves (filled black circles)
are the additive spectral changes of each protein, independently acquired
and generated by spectral composite computation. For wtTTR/CLU mixtures,
summed (filled circles) and observed (open circles) thermal unfolding
profiles exhibited nearly identical melt transitions (Figure 2A). The L55P TTR/CLU summed and observed melting
comparison showed a small but distinct deviation in the CD signal
at 220 nm (Figure 2B). For the monoTTR/CLU
mixture, the summed (black circles) and observed (red triangles) melting
data showed a considerable divergence beginning at 45 °C (Figure 2C), leading to a loss of secondary structure in
the monoTTR/CLU mixture. This result was substantially smaller than
the calculated sum of CD signals from individual proteins, suggesting
a distinct stabilization effect of CLU on the secondary structure
of monoTTR.

Comparison of thermal unfolding data for equimolar mixtures of
transthyretin (TTR) variants with clusterin (CLU). Secondary structural
changes of each rTTR/CLU mixture during heating at a rate of 2 °C/min
were obtained by continuous monitoring of the CD signal at 220 nm.
Observed melting curves for equimolar mixtures of (A) wt, (B) L55P,
and (C) monoTTR with CLU are shown as open black circles, green diamonds,
and red triangles, respectively; each data set was compared to the
corresponding sum of melting curves from the individual proteins (filled
black circles). (D) Data from a direct comparison of observed melting
curves for equimolar mixtures of CLU and wt, L55P, or monomeric rTTR
are shown as open black circles, green diamonds, or red triangles,
respectively.

Direct comparisons of
observed melting data for TTR/CLU mixtures
were also examined (Figure 2D). The wtTTR/CLU
(black circles) and L55P TTR/CLU (green diamonds) mixtures showed
similar unfolding of CLU at a Tm of 48
°C; the monoTTR/CLU mixture (red triangles) exhibited less change
in secondary structure for this low-temperature transition. Two distinct
transitions were evident in the melting curves of L55P TTR/CLU and
monoTTR/CLU mixtures; however, only in the monoTTR/CLU sample was
there a completed second transition demonstrated by a plateau in the
curve above 90 °C. The higher-Tm transition
in the L55P TTR/CLU mixture corresponded to the L55P tetramer melt
transition observed in Figure 1C.

To
compare the thermal unfolding of monoTTR, CLU, and the monoTTR/CLU
mixture, the data were scaled together (Figure 3). CLU (filled blue squares) and the monoTTR/CLU mixture (open red
triangles) showed identical low-Tm transitions
corresponding to CLU unfolding [Tm = 48
°C (vertical dashed line)]. Interestingly, the monoTTR/CLU mixture
had a unique Tm transition above 80 °C
that was not observed in individual samples of monoTTR or CLU. The
higher-Tm transition of the monoTTR/CLU
mixture indicated retention of secondary structure by the proteins
in the mixture (vertical dashed line). Midpoint transition temperatures
determined from peak positions in the first derivatives of the CD
data further illustrated the presence of a high-Tm transition for the monoTTR/CLU mixture (Figure 3B). Apparent Tm values
were 48 °C for CLU, 60 °C for monoTTR, and 47 and ∼80
°C and higher for the monoTTR/CLU mixture. The unique Tm transition above 80 °C was shown to be
a rate-dependent process with a shifted melting transition and greater
structural change observed under slower thermal stress conditions
(Figure 3C). Reversibility assessment indicated
that unfolding of L55P TTR and monoTTR was irreversible (data not
shown). Interestingly, while unfolding of the L55P TTR/CLU mixture
was partially reversible, results from our studies of the monoTTR/CLU
mixture indicated a completely reversible unfolding–folding
phenomenon.

Effect of clusterin on thermal unfolding of transthyretin (TTR)
monomers. (A) Thermal unfolding profiles for monoTTR, CLU, and an
equimolar mixture of the proteins were constructed from CD data recorded
at 220 nm with samples heated continuously at a rate of 2 °C/min.
The apparent melting temperatures (Tm)
for samples, indicated by vertical dashed lines, were determined from
peak maxima obtained from first-derivative calculations (B) of the
melting data. CLU alone (blue squares) and the monoTTR/CLU mixture
(open red triangles) exhibit similar lower-temperature structural
transitions (Tm values of 48 and 47 °C,
respectively) and a plateau at ∼60 °C. MonoTTR alone (filled
red triangles) exhibits a single structural transition with a Tm of 60 °C and a plateau at ∼80
°C. The monoTTR/CLU mixture also displays a second unique, higher-temperature
structural transition (>80 °C). (C) Comparison of monoTTR/CLU
mixture unfolding curves recorded at fast (2 °C/min) and slow
(0.1 °C/min) heating rates, showing a rate-dependent shift in
the high-temperature (>80 °C) melting transition.

### Oligomeric β-Sheet Rich Structures
of Transthyretin Are
Bound by Clusterin in a Stable Manner

We tested the ability
of CLU to directly interact with oligomeric forms of rTTR. Wild-type
rTTR oligomers were generated at pH 2.0 by rapid aggregation initiated
upon addition of NaCl after rTTR unfolding; by 60 min, all tetrameric
rTTR was transformed into oligomers with a molecular weight of >200
kDa [high-molecular weight (HMW)] and monomers (Figure 4A). Wild-type rTTR secondary structural changes during oligomerization
were monitored using CD (Figure 4B). A loss
of native β-sheet content, as seen in the wtTTR native sample
(black line), and a transition to random-coil conformation occurred
at pH 2.0 (wtTTR acid denatured, dashed red line). A subsequent transition
to β-sheet structure and accumulation of β-sheet content
over time were observed, indicating conformational conversion of the
rTTR during oligomerization. Light microscopic examination of precipitated
rTTR after a 14 day incubation under acidic conditions showed Congo
red binding and amyloid fibril specific apple-green birefringence
when viewed under standard and polarized light, respectively (Figure 4C,D).

(B) CD spectra of samples removed at timed intervals (15, 60 and 105
min, and 17 h) from a single continuous reaction mixture showing secondary

assay, stained with Congo red, and viewed under bright (C) and polarized
(D) light. Arrows indicate wt rTTR amyloid fibrils.

SPR biosensor detection was used to characterize
surfaces to which
the previously described native or oligomeric forms of wt rTTR had
been covalently bound. We used diflunisal and Congo red to determine
the structural nature of rTTR-modified surfaces (Figure 5). The native rTTR surface demonstrated substantial diflunisal
binding (0–60 s injection) and negligible Congo red binding
(0–120 s injection), indicating intact TTR tetrameric structure
(Figure 5A,B, gray lines) as measured by a
change in response units (RU) in the SPR sensorgrams. An observed
decrease in the level of diflunisal binding (Figure 5A, black line) with a corresponding marked increase in the
level of Congo red binding (Figure 5B, black
line) of HMW TTR surfaces was also measured. Serum-purified CLU was
passed over the native and HMW TTR surfaces (panels C and D of Figure 5, respectively). Concentration-dependent binding
of CLU to the HMW TTR surface was observed during the injection (0–300
s) phase (Figure 5D). No CLU binding took place
with the native TTR surface (Figure 5C). It
is important to note that the CLU binding sensorgrams demonstrate
a concentration-dependent increase in magnitude that was consistent
with the increased accumulated mass of CLU during the injection phase.
In addition, the dissociation phase beginning at 300 s (vertical dashed
line) was quite slow, indicating that the CLU–HMW TTR interactions
at the SPR chip surface were more stable than interactions of TTR
with diflunisal and Congo red.

data were fit using a conservative Langmuir 1:1 (analyte:ligand) interaction

### Clusterin Prevents Transthyretin Amyloid Fibril Formation and
Demonstrates Cooperative Inhibition in the Presence of Diflunisal

Finally, we investigated the ability of CLU, diflunisal, and a
combination of the two to inhibit wt, L55P, and monomeric rTTR amyloid
fibril formation under mildly acidic conditions. Interestingly, monoTTR
in the presence of diflunisal, at neutral pH incubated for 2 h, showed
enhanced dimerization and forced tetramer formation (Figure 6). After a 10 day incubation period, amyloid fibril
formation reaction end points were measured using the quantitative
Congo red binding spectral shift method.53 As wt TTR tetramer is stable at pH 5.0, the spectral absorbance
characteristics of wt rTTR reactions were nearly identical to those
of Congo red alone, indicating no fibril formation. However, L55P
and monomeric rTTR end point reactions showed significant amyloid
formation as indicated by increased amounts of Congo red bound in
solution (Figure 7A,B). For L55P, a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test differences among treatments
with diflunisal, CLU, a combination of the two, and BSA as a negative
control for the reaction (Figure 7A; F = 46.77; p = 0.0004). Tukey post hoc
comparisons of the treatments indicate that diflunisal (n = 2; no bound Congo red indicated), CLU [n = 2; M = 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) from −0.76
to 1.81], and diflunisal with CLU (n = 2; no bound
Congo red indicated) yielded bound Congo red concentrations significantly
lower than those with untreated L55P (n = 2; M = 1.57; 95% CI from 0.54 to 2.59) and L55P TTR with BSA
(n = 2; M = 1.77; 95% CI from −1.35
to 4.89). For the monomer, a one-way ANOVA was used to test differences
among treatments with diflunisal, CLU, a combination of the two, and
BSA (Figure 7B; F = 407.9; p < 0.0001). Tukey post hoc comparisons of the treatments
indicate that CLU (n = 3; M = 1.54;
95% CI from 1.27 to 1.81), and diflunisal with CLU (n = 3; M = 1.04; 95% CI from 0.92 to 1.15) resulted
in amounts of bound Congo red significantly smaller than those with
untreated monomer (n = 3; M = 2.64;
95% CI from 2.42 to 2.87) or monomer with BSA (n =
3; M = 2.82; 95% CI from 2.74 to 2.89). Additionally,
amounts of bound Congo red in the combination treatments of monomer
with diflunisal and CLU were significantly smaller than those for
the treatment with only CLU (p < 0.001).

### Discussion

The inherent plasticity and unstructured
nature of most proteins
require macromolecular assistance to prevent aggregation and ensure
proper functioning. In vivo proteostasis networks
are normally in place to maintain a properly folded proteome, influence
the rate of proteome folding, prevent aggregation, and mediate degradation
allowing efficient protein turnover.56,57 Recently,
extracellular chaperones have been proposed as integral components
of a quality control system facilitating removal of circulating misfolded
proteins and, as such, may play a significant role in the pathophysiology
of TTR amyloidosis and other protein deposition diseases.38,58 CLU was the first extracellular chaperone to be identified, and
extensive investigations over the past decade have shown that it has
a chaperoning function similar to that of small heat shock proteins
such as αB-crystallin.38−40,44,45,59,60 We have identified CLU as a component of TTR amyloid
deposits in cardiac tissues from patients with ATTRwt (SSA) and ATTRm,46 and others have reported co-aggregation of CLU
with variant TTR in a cerebrospinal fluid matrix.61

Herein, we report the first biophysical studies detailing
the stabilizing
effect of CLU on TTR unfolding and aggregation. Our CD data revealed
that CLU has the capacity to stabilize the secondary structure of
monomeric TTR during protein unfolding. Indeed, CLU preferentially
bound to and stabilized monomeric TTR (mono, F87M/L110M). Equimolar
mixtures of CLU and TTR were chosen within normal physiological concentrations
as proamyloid effects of CLU have been reported under conditions in
which the amyloid precursor is present in molar excess.44

Comparative analyses between the summed
and observed CD spectral
profiles for equimolar mixtures of monomeric TTR and CLU (monoTTR/CLU)
showed a stabilization effect not predicted by the summed melting
curve (Figure 2). A delay in the higher-Tm transition observed for the L55P TTR/CLU mixture
was evident in the divergence from the summed protein melting curve.
This indicated a small but substantial stabilization effect during
L55P unfolding, although it was not nearly as robust as that observed
for monomeric TTR, because of rate-limiting tetramer destabilization.
The disassembly of the L55P tetramer into monomers that interact with
CLU may account for this observation. As for the mixtures of the wt
TTR tetramer with CLU, no such difference between the summed and observed
spectral changes was detected, thus providing evidence of a preferential
CLU stabilization effect on monomeric TTR. Slight fluctuations at
the 25 °C baseline for all profiles were within experimental
error, possibly because of minor protein concentration differences.
Moreover, low-temperature unfolding transitions were identical in
the CD spectra of CLU versus the equimolar mixtures of TTR tetramer
and CLU (tetramer/CLU). Hence, it appears that in the wtTTR/CLU mixture,
CLU and tetrameric TTR unfold independently.

The equimolar monoTTR/CLU
mixture showed deviation of the CD signal
at lower temperatures (CLU alone melt transition) with less unfolding
during this early transition compared to that of CLU mixtures with
wt and L55P TTR (Figure 2D). The secondary
structure in the monoTTR/CLU mixture was preserved at the higher temperatures
as demonstrated by the melt transition above 80 °C (Figure 3); these data indicate significant stabilization
of TTR monomer by the presence of CLU. As CLU and monoTTR unfold simultaneously,
chaperone interactions help to stabilize secondary structures and
generate a unique molecular complex with a Tm higher than that of either individual protein. These data
suggest that the structural stability in the mixture of the two proteins
is greater than that of either CLU or monoTTR alone. The stabilization
of unfolding TTR monomer by CLU supports a mechanism whereby CLU,
acting in a chaperoning capacity, interacts with TTR monomer and prevents
a conformational conversion to HMW oligomeric species. A mutual stabilization
effect of these proteins on one another is possible under thermal
stress conditions, although the reversible nature of unfolding and
additional BSA controls presented in Figure 7 further supports the chaperoning model of CLU. The chaperoning interactions
of CLU with TTR observed in Figure 3 likely
occurred at lower temperatures as we detected the loss of those protein
structures at the higher-temperature melt transition.

To confirm
that CLU binds directly to misfolded and aggregated
forms of TTR, but not to tetramer, we used SPR. SPR biosensor chip
surfaces, prepared with HMW oligomeric wt TTR, exhibited an increased
level of Congo red binding with a concomitant decrease in the level
of diflunisal binding (Figure 5). This indicated
that partially unfolded and oligomeric forms of TTR, i.e., amyloidogenic
structures, were present and could be detected by small molecule binding.
CLU bound, in a concentration-dependent manner, to unfolded and oligomeric
HMW TTR that was coupled to the biosensor surfaces; a slow dissociation
phase indicated that this was a stable association between CLU and
HMW TTR. These data provide evidence that CLU has the capacity to
bind higher-order oligomeric species of TTR.

By using rTTR variants
with differing structures, stabilities,
and propensities to form amyloidogenic oligomers and fibrils, we were
able to test the effects of CLU and diflunisal on aggregation and
fibrillogenesis, while comparing the differences between monomeric
and tetrameric forms of TTR. Studies of L55P, pretreated with diflunisal,
demonstrated the capacity of the small molecule to stabilize tetrameric
TTR and inhibit fibril formation as shown by the absence of observable
Congo red binding (Figure 7A). CLU treatment
of L55P significantly inhibited fibril formation as was indicated
by the decreased level of bound Congo red in solution, and the diflunisal/CLU
mixture completely eliminated binding of Congo red to L55P. As anticipated,
the propensity of monomeric TTR to form fibrils was stronger than
that of L55P. Interestingly, despite enhanced dimerization and forced
tetramerization of monomeric TTR by diflunisal (Figure 6), these quaternary structural changes did not inhibit amyloid
formation over the tested time interval. However, CLU pretreatments
significantly inhibited monomeric TTR fibril formation, while the
combination of CLU and diflunisal showed significantly greater decreases
in the level of fibril formation (Figure 7B),
exhibiting a novel cooperative effect.

Wild-type TTR and more
than 100 TTR variants are amyloidogenic;
i.e., these proteins can all form fibrils that are similar in ultrastructure
and composition. While it is possible that other mechanisms unique
to different TTR variants exist, it is widely accepted that TTR amyloid
fibril formation is dependent on dissociation of the native tetramer
to monomer. This initial rate-limiting step of tetramer dissociation,
believed to be a common stage in TTR amyloid pathogenesis despite
the amino acid sequence heterogeneity of TTR variants, is the basis
of our interpretation of the experimental data presented in this report
and in defining a role for CLU in the TTR amyloid hypothesis. Our
data support a mechanism whereby both unfolded/misfolded TTR monomer
and HMW oligomeric species are chaperoned by CLU to divert these amyloid
precursors off the pathway of amyloid fibril formation (Figure 8, thick solid arrows). The observed cooperative
effect of the combination of CLU and diflunisal on inhibiting amyloid
fibril formation may be due to the enhancement of CLU chaperoning
capacity in the presence of diflunisal, given that diflunisal did
not inhibit monoTTR amyloid fibril formation. This has yet to be determined,
but a diflunisal-stabilized TTR intermediate could explain this observed
phenomenon, thereby enhancing CLU proteostatic functions to promote
clearance (Figure 8, dashed arrows). The complex
milieu of in vivo amyloid pathology is difficult
to precisely reproduce in experimental models. The biological meaning
of interactions of CLU with TTR in amyloidosis is unclear and warrants
further investigation. Potential neuroprotective mechanisms have been
suggested along with evidence that CLU influences the aggregation
of TTR in culture.62 Our biochemical experiments
support a solution-based interaction model for the chaperoning activity
of CLU in the circulation and in tissues rich in unfolded TTR.

Transthyretin
(TTR) amyloid fibril formation cascade and a possible
model of clusterin (CLU) chaperoning interactions with unfolded TTR
and diflunisal. The promiscuous chaperoning capacity of CLU and its
ability to recognize regions of exposed hydrophobicity afford multiple
points of interaction with unfolded/misfolded TTR along the amyloid
fibril formation pathway. Shown are potential pathways for CLU stabilization
of TTR monomers and oligomers, diverting these precursors off the
pathway of TTR amyloid fibril formation (thick solid arrows). The
influence of diflunisal on monomeric TTR dimerization and forced tetramerization
indicates the potency of binding of small molecules to variant TTR.
A cooperative effect of CLU and diflunisal on preventing amyloid fibril
formation, hypothetically, through a diflunisal-stabilized TTR intermediate
allowing for enhanced CLU chaperoning capacity (dashed arrows), is
also shown.

The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug diflunisal has been shown
to stabilize TTR tetramers in vitro(18) and to slow the progression of polyneuropathy in patients
with ATTRm amyloidosis.24 The activity
of diflunisal in vivo may depend upon its ability
to enhance the chaperoning activity of endogenous CLU, as well as
its direct effect on stabilization of TTR tetramers (Figure 8). One might also propose a novel combinational
approach to ATTRm or ATTRwt (SSA) treatment involving both diflunisal
and CLU to augment the chaperoning and removal of misfolded and aggregated
proteins. Small molecule activation of innate proteostasis networks
may also bolster extracellular chaperone activity to further enhance
pharmacological chaperone therapies.
