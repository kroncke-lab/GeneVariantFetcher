## Phenotype and prognostic factors in geriatric and non‐geriatric patients with transthyretin cardiomyopathy

### Abstract

AbstractAimsTransthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR‐CM) may be an underestimated cause of heart failure among geriatric patients and represent a unique phenotype and prognostic profile.Methods and resultsThis retrospective, observational, cohort study characterizes cardiac and extracardiac disorders at diagnosis and assesses prognosis among ATTR‐CM patients based on age (geriatric vs. non‐geriatric) and amyloidosis subtype (wild type, ATTRwt and hereditary, ATTRv). In total, 943 patients with ATTR‐CM were included, of which 306 had ATTRv and 637 had ATTRwt. Among these, 331 (35.1%) were non‐geriatric (<75 years), and 612 (64.9%) were geriatric (≥75 years). The population exhibited conduction abnormalities, atrial fibrillation and ischaemic heart disease that progressively deteriorated with age. Among ATTRwt patients, peripheral neuropathy, neurovegetative symptoms, and hearing loss were present across all age groups, but reports of carpal tunnel symptoms or surgery decreased with age. Conversely, among ATTRv patients, reports of extracardiac symptoms increased with age and Val122ILe mutation was highly prevalent among geriatric patients. The 3‐year survival was higher among non‐geriatric ATTR‐CM patients (76%) than geriatric patients (55%) and predictors of 3‐year mortality differed. Notably, predictors identified among geriatric patients were alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR = 1.004, 95% CI: [0.001–1.100)], troponin T hs (HR = 1.005, 95% CI: [1.001–1.120)] and tricuspid insufficiency (HR = 1.194, 95% CI: [1.02–1.230)]. Whereas, among non‐geriatric patients, NT‐proBNP (HR = 1.002, 95% CI: [1.02–1.04], global longitudinal strain (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: [0.922–0.989], and glomerular filtration rate (HR = 0.984, 95% CI: [0.968–1.00) were identified. We propose a 3‐stage prognostic staging system combining troponin T hs (≥44 ng/L) and ALP levels (≥119 UI/L). In the geriatric population, this model discriminated survival more precisely than the National Amyloidosis Centre staging, particularly for classifying between stage 1 (82%), stage 2 (50%) and stage 3 (32%) for ATTRv and ATTRwt.ConclusionsThese diagnostic and prognostic indicators, along with ATTR subtype, highlight the distinct characteristics of this important, geriatric ATTR‐CM patient group. Recognizing these mortality markers can be valuable for geriatricians to improve the prognostic quality management of geriatric patients with ATTR‐CM.

### Introduction

The two major transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) subtypes are hereditary (ATTRv) and wild‐type (ATTRwt).
1
 ATTRv is caused by mutations in the TTR gene, resulting in polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy (CM), or a mixed phenotype, a median diagnostic age depending on the phenotype and mutation and a mutation‐dependent progression rate.

,

 Conversely, ATTRwt occurs idiopathically, predominantly among older males, with a median diagnosis age of 77 years.
4
, 
5
 It is often associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, or digestive symptoms.
6
 Progression is relatively slow, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction occurs later in life, often misdiagnosed as age‐related cardiac conditions, including hypertensive cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart disease, and decompensated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

 Furthermore, autopsy studies revealed that 25–40% of myocardial samples from individuals aged over 80 years with heart failure had amyloid deposits.

Little is known today about the natural history and prevalence of cardiac and extracardiac symptoms among older ATTR patients, particularly ATTRwt subtype.
13
 Currently, the prevalence and significance of carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and other tendon anomalies is well understood. However, little is known about the prevalence of cardiac and extracardiac symptoms in relation to age at diagnosis, especially among ATTRwt patients, for whom are thought to be spared from neurological symptoms that significantly impact quality of life and autonomy. This lack of knowledge may be partly due to the lack of older patients included in clinical research due to age‐related co‐morbidities, physical or psychological frailty, or the risk of autonomy loss.
14
 Yet reports from clinical practice and the literature suggest that younger ATTR patients with early‐onset extracardiac symptoms seem to have a worse prognosis than those with later onset symptoms.
15

Considering the aging population, a clear understanding of prognostic factors in both ATTRv and ATTRwt populations of all ages is needed. The current prognostic score, the National Amyloid Center (NAC) classification, is validated for use in ATTRwt and ATTRv and includes NT‐proBNP and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study.
16
 However, it is unclear today if this is an accurate measure for prognosis among geriatric ATTR patients.

Therefore, there is a need to better understand specific signs and symptoms related to amyloidosis between younger and older ATTRv and ATTRwt patients to improve diagnosis and access to treatment. This is pertinent, considering new treatment approaches are now available.

This study aims to define and describe the cardiac and extracardiac amyloidosis signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis and assess prognosis among geriatric patients with ATTR‐CM.

### Methods

This retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted at the Cardiac Amyloidosis Referral Centre, Henri Mondor University Hospital, Creteil, France (CARC) among the 2948 patients referred for suspected cardiac amyloidosis and registered on the Amyloidosis Network registry between 24 June 2008 and 31 October 2020. Only those patients with confirmed ATTR‐CM were included.
20
 Those patients younger than 75 years were defined as non‐geriatric and those 75 years or older as geriatric, and this population was stratified into four subgroups according to age. This definition and threshold were chosen according to recent research among older patients

Amyloidosis diagnosis was confirmed on cardiac ultrasound, bisphosphenate scintigraphy or medical resonance imaging according to current guidlelines.
20
 Genetic sequencing was performed to differentiate ATTRv from ATTRwt. Patients with a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis other than ATTRv or ATTRwt, who had ATTR amyloidosis but no clinical symptoms or identified genotypic marker were excluded.

The primary objective was to describe and compare cardiac and extracardiac disorders in patients with ATTR‐CM, between geriatric and non‐geriatric patient age at diagnosis, stratified into 5 year age groups, and ATTRv and ATTRwt subtypes.

The secondary objective was to investigate potential prognostic factors between non‐geriatric and geriatric populations and amyloidosis subtypes with a focus on all‐cause mortality at 3 years, compared with the (NAC) staging.

Data were collected the time of diagnosis and during usual follow‐up visits. The primary endpoint measures were assessed with clinical, demographic, and cardiac parameters. Notable clinical and demographic parameters included age at diagnosis, cardiac amyloidosis history, extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms and delay from onset to diagnosis. Cardiac parameters included the NYHA functional class at admission, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic morphology assessments and cardiac function. Echocardiography was performed using Vivid E 95. Post‐treatment imaging was performed with Echopac™ Software, to measure left ventricular wall thickening, interventricular septum, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, left ventricular volume, and global longitudinal strain. Valve abnormalities, including aortic stenosis (AS) and tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR), were also measured.

Tricuspid regurgitation severity was assessed according to the American Society of Echocardiography criteria.
23
 These criteria define severity stages as mild, moderate or severe according to the following specific criteria. Mild TR exhibits a thin and small central colour jet, vena contracta (VC) width <3 mm, proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) radius <0.4 cm at Nyquist 30–40 cm/s, incomplete or faint continuous wave Doppler jet, systolic dominant hepatic venous flow, normal RV and right atrial dimensions, EROA < 0.2 cm2, and RVol < 30 mL. Moderate severity was defined by a VC width between 0.3 and 0.69 mm, EROA between 0.2 and 0.4 cm2 and RVol between 30 and 44 mL. Severe regurgitation was indicated by a dilated tricuspid annulus with no valve coaptation or a flail leaflet, a large central jet covering more than 50% of the right atrial area, VC width exceeding 7 mm, PISA >0.9 cm at Nyquist 30–40 cm/s, a dense/triangular continuous wave Doppler jet, systolic reversal of hepatic venous flow, dilated right ventricle, EROA larger than 0.4 cm2, and RVol >45 mL This classification was used to categorize the subjects into those with no or mild TR and those with moderate‐to‐severe TR.

Extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms included autonomic and sensory neuropathy, neurological symptoms (including carpal tunnel syndrome and related surgeries), and autonomic dysfunction.

Laboratory data included renal and cardiac biomarkers, liver function test results, and (NAC) severity data.
16

Mortality data was collected from the patient's medical record or the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) death register. All data were recorded in Excel. Labial Biopsy were usually indicated for the patients and cardiac biopsies are performed in our centre if necessary (gammopathy) according to European recommendations. Cardiac MRI was proposed based on patient age and logistical considerations.

Patients provided consent for their clinical and demographic data to be used. All data were analysed in compliance with data protection regulations, patient rights, and ethics approval (#1431858).

The clinical, biological, and imaging characteristics were described for each of the five age groups and presented in tables, bar charts, and Venn diagrams. Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentiles). Categorical variables were presented as absolute values and percentages. The non‐geriatric and geriatric populations were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, the geriatric subgroups were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous data, and categorical variables were assessed using the chi‐squared test. The significance level was set at P < 0.01.

Survival from the time of diagnosis was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method for ATTRv and ATTRwt subtypes, in accordance with Gillmore staging, for both the non‐geriatric and geriatric populations. These survival curves were then compared using a log rank analysis. The predictive value of mortality between the geriatric and non‐geriatric populations was assessed with univariate analysis. Subsequently, multivariate analysis incorporated established predictive factors of mortality and any significant new parameters identified in the study. A threshold of P < 0.01 was adopted for statistical significance. The seven most significant factors were included in the multivariate Cox model, adjusted for age, and presented with hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

The threshold values for these biological parameters were determined with a conditional tree model to construct a prognostic staging system specifically for the geriatric population. This model was selected to establish potential thresholds for prognostic staging. Subsequently, survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan–Meier approach within the geriatric population, and differences between the various stages were assessed using the log rank test.

The CARC research team conducted the statistical analyses using SPSS 21 software (IBM Armonk, New York, USA). A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The assumptions for the Cox proportional hazards model were evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals. Variables were chosen to be included into the Cox prognostic model if they were statistically significant had clinical or scientific relevance. To avoid multicollinearity and ensure model adequacy, correlations between predictors were examined, and diagnostic tools such as residual plots and the Akaike information criterion were used to compare the two Cox models. The likelihood ratio test was used to compare the full model with more predictive factors to a simplified model with fewer predictive factors.

### Amyloidosis diagnosis

Amyloidosis diagnosis was confirmed on cardiac ultrasound, bisphosphenate scintigraphy or medical resonance imaging according to current guidlelines.
20
 Genetic sequencing was performed to differentiate ATTRv from ATTRwt. Patients with a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis other than ATTRv or ATTRwt, who had ATTR amyloidosis but no clinical symptoms or identified genotypic marker were excluded.

### Primary and secondary objectives

The primary objective was to describe and compare cardiac and extracardiac disorders in patients with ATTR‐CM, between geriatric and non‐geriatric patient age at diagnosis, stratified into 5 year age groups, and ATTRv and ATTRwt subtypes.

The secondary objective was to investigate potential prognostic factors between non‐geriatric and geriatric populations and amyloidosis subtypes with a focus on all‐cause mortality at 3 years, compared with the (NAC) staging.

### Measures and data collection

Data were collected the time of diagnosis and during usual follow‐up visits. The primary endpoint measures were assessed with clinical, demographic, and cardiac parameters. Notable clinical and demographic parameters included age at diagnosis, cardiac amyloidosis history, extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms and delay from onset to diagnosis. Cardiac parameters included the NYHA functional class at admission, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic morphology assessments and cardiac function. Echocardiography was performed using Vivid E 95. Post‐treatment imaging was performed with Echopac™ Software, to measure left ventricular wall thickening, interventricular septum, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, left ventricular volume, and global longitudinal strain. Valve abnormalities, including aortic stenosis (AS) and tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR), were also measured.

Tricuspid regurgitation severity was assessed according to the American Society of Echocardiography criteria.
23
 These criteria define severity stages as mild, moderate or severe according to the following specific criteria. Mild TR exhibits a thin and small central colour jet, vena contracta (VC) width <3 mm, proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) radius <0.4 cm at Nyquist 30–40 cm/s, incomplete or faint continuous wave Doppler jet, systolic dominant hepatic venous flow, normal RV and right atrial dimensions, EROA < 0.2 cm2, and RVol < 30 mL. Moderate severity was defined by a VC width between 0.3 and 0.69 mm, EROA between 0.2 and 0.4 cm2 and RVol between 30 and 44 mL. Severe regurgitation was indicated by a dilated tricuspid annulus with no valve coaptation or a flail leaflet, a large central jet covering more than 50% of the right atrial area, VC width exceeding 7 mm, PISA >0.9 cm at Nyquist 30–40 cm/s, a dense/triangular continuous wave Doppler jet, systolic reversal of hepatic venous flow, dilated right ventricle, EROA larger than 0.4 cm2, and RVol >45 mL This classification was used to categorize the subjects into those with no or mild TR and those with moderate‐to‐severe TR.

Extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms included autonomic and sensory neuropathy, neurological symptoms (including carpal tunnel syndrome and related surgeries), and autonomic dysfunction.

Laboratory data included renal and cardiac biomarkers, liver function test results, and (NAC) severity data.

Mortality data was collected from the patient's medical record or the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) death register. All data were recorded in Excel. Labial Biopsy were usually indicated for the patients and cardiac biopsies are performed in our centre if necessary (gammopathy) according to European recommendations. Cardiac MRI was proposed based on patient age and logistical considerations.

Patients provided consent for their clinical and demographic data to be used. All data were analysed in compliance with data protection regulations, patient rights, and ethics approval (#1431858).

### Statistical analyses

The clinical, biological, and imaging characteristics were described for each of the five age groups and presented in tables, bar charts, and Venn diagrams. Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentiles). Categorical variables were presented as absolute values and percentages. The non‐geriatric and geriatric populations were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, the geriatric subgroups were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous data, and categorical variables were assessed using the chi‐squared test. The significance level was set at P < 0.01.

Survival from the time of diagnosis was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method for ATTRv and ATTRwt subtypes, in accordance with Gillmore staging, for both the non‐geriatric and geriatric populations. These survival curves were then compared using a log rank analysis. The predictive value of mortality between the geriatric and non‐geriatric populations was assessed with univariate analysis. Subsequently, multivariate analysis incorporated established predictive factors of mortality and any significant new parameters identified in the study.

### Results

In total, the CARC received 2948 referrals between 2008 and 2020. Of these, 2005 patients were excluded for having a confirmed diagnosis other than ATTR‐CM. This left 943 patients with confirmed ATTR‐CM. Among these, 306 patients had ATTRv and 637 had ATTRwt, and most (64.9%, n = 612) were geriatric (age >75 years) (Figure

1
 and Table

1
).

Data are presented as median. P = comparison between all age subgroups, P′ = comparison between non‐geriatric patients (<75 years) and geriatric patients (≥75 years).

ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine transaminase; AoS, aortic stenosis; AST, aspartate transaminase; BMI, body mass index; GGT, gamma‐glutamyl transferase; IVS, interventricular septum; LV, left ventricle; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation; NYHA, New York Heart Association Classification; TR, tricuspid regurgitation.

Most ATTR patients included in the study were male in both non‐geriatric and geriatric age groups. In the ATTRwt patient subgroup, a larger proportion were of European origin other than Portuguese, whereas the ATTRv patient group included diverse ethnic backgrounds, of European, Portuguese, Afro‐Caribbean, sub‐Saharan African, and North African origin (Table

1
 and Table

S1
).

Among ATTRv patients, ATTR Val122Ile was the most prevalent mutation in all age groups and the only variant identified in patients older than 85 years. Among geriatric patients, ATTR Val30Met was the second most commonly observed mutation (Figure 
S1
).

Cardiac characteristics for the total population age and subtype are shown in Tables

,

, and

. NYHA cardiac severity was notably more severe among geriatric patients in both subgroups. Concerning previous cardiac event history, having a pacemaker, atrial fibrillation, or ischaemic cardiopathologies were most prevalent, irrespective of patient age. Cardiac amyloidosis symptoms appeared earlier among non‐geriatric patients, as demonstrated in Table

 and Figure

.

Data are presented as median. P = comparison between all age subgroups; P′ = comparison between patients <75 years and geriatric patient defined as patients ≥75 years.

Median cardiac and hepatic biomarker levels increased with age. Specifically, troponin T hs and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, which progressively increased with increasing age in both ATTRwt and ATTRv populations.

Echocardiographic findings revealed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower among geriatric patients than non‐geriatric patients overall. However, differences were observed between ATTR subtypes. With advancing age, LVEF tended to decrease among ATTRv patients, but remained relatively stable among ATTRwt patients. Interestingly, LVEF approached near‐normal levels in patients aged over 90 years in both subpopulations. Although the interventricular septum thickness was similar in both geriatric and non‐geriatric populations, significantly thicker LV wall, decreased LV volume and more severe LV global strain was observed among geriatric patients. These findings varied between subtypes with advancing age. While all echocardiographic measurements worsened among geriatric ATTRv patients, only the LV volume significantly decreased in the geriatric ATTRwt subgroup.

The proportion of patients with moderate to severe AS was significantly higher among geriatric patients in both the ATTRwt and ATTRv subgroups. Additionally, among geriatric, ATTRwt patients, moderate and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurred more frequently.

Extracardiac symptoms reported at diagnosis for the whole population are described in Table

, according to subtype in Tables

2
 and

 and illustrated in Figures

2
 and

. Overall, peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal issues occurred more frequently among non‐geriatric patients but the frequency of hearing loss increased with age (Figure

).

Peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, hearing loss and digestive symptoms differ according to age, ATTR‐CM subtype (ATTRwt and ATTRwt). Histogram (A) illustrates extracardiac symptoms in the total transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) population. Histogram (B) illustrates, hearing loss occurred more frequently in all age groups than other extracardiac symptoms among ATTRwt. Histogram (C) illustrates more patients presented with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy or orthostatic hypotension among the non‐geriatric ATTRv patients.

Histogram (A) Illustrates a general decline in carpal tunnel symptoms or surgery with age. Histogram (B) Illustrates history of carpal tunnel symptoms and surgery decreased with age among ATTRwt. Histogram (C) illustrates symptoms and surgery increased with age, among ATTRv patients.

In the ATTRv subgroup, the proportion of patients with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy and/or orthostatic hypotension was significantly higher among non‐geriatric patients. Conversely, reports of carpal tunnel symptoms, associated surgeries, and hearing loss increased with advancing age in ATTRv (Figures

2
C
 and 
3
C
).

In the ATTRwt subgroup, extracardiac symptoms were observed in approximately a quarter of the population and hearing loss was prevalent in approximately two‐thirds of patients across all age groups. Importantly, the time between the onset of extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms and diagnosis did not differ with age. Fewer ATTRwt geriatric individuals reported carpal tunnel syndrome (Figures

2
 and 
3
).

Overall, most geriatric patients exhibited a more severe cardiac condition, classified as NAC stage II and III, compared with non‐geriatric patients. However, it is worth noting that among the seven patients diagnosed with ATTRv who were over 85 years old, three were at stage I, four at stage II, and none at stage III. In contrast, among ATTRwt patients, the incidence of stage III increased with age. Among those patients who presented at 90 years or older, and for whom renal function tests were available, fewer were at stage II and more at stage I and III (Figure 
4
). No significant differences were found in the proportion of patients receiving tafamidis treatment between non‐geriatric and geriatric patients (Table 
2
).

Survival for the total ATTR‐CM population by age groups is illustrated in the Kaplan–Meier survival curves (Figure 
S3
). Overall, 315 patients died during the 3 year follow‐up and the overall median survival time from study inclusion was 18 months (95% CI: 7–30). After 3 years, survival was significantly lower among older patients [43%, at 16 months (95% CI: 5–22) > 85 years], than younger patients (log rank P‐value <0.001). However, median survival was similar between those aged between 75–79 and 80–84 years [55%, at 17 months (95% CI: 8–30)].

When the population was classified according to NAC scoring, we observed that survival rates diverged between the non‐geriatric and geriatric groups. Among non‐geriatric patients, a clear distinction was observed between stage 2 and 3. For Stage 1, the median survival was not reached, and the 3‐year mortality rate was 86.2%. Stage 2 exhibited a median survival of 30 months (95% CI: 23–34), while stage 3 showed a median survival of 25 months (95% CI: 17–28), with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) (Figure
5Ai). Surprisingly, the 3 year survival rate was the same for both NAC stage 2 and 3 in the geriatric population (40%), median survival 26 months (95% CI: 13–27) (Figure 5Aii

). Survival did not differ between geriatric patients with ATTRv and ATTRwt for the three NAC stages at 3 years, with a log rank P‐value of 0.456 and 0.561, respectively

In the non‐geriatric population, the prognostic factors of mortality on multivariate cox analysis were SBP, log NT‐proBNP (HR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.02–1.04), global longitudinal strain (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.922–0.989), and glomerular filtration rate (HR = 0.984, 95% CI: 0.968–1.00) (Table 
4
).

Predictors of mortality in the non‐geriatric and geriatric population

In the geriatric population, the prognostic factors of mortality on multivariate Cox analysis were systolic blood pressure (SBP) (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98–0.89), ALP (HR = 1.004, 95% CI: 0.001–1.100), troponin T hs (HR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.001–1.120), tricuspid insufficiency (HR = 1.194, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23), and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (Table 
4
).

Concerning geriatric ATTR subtype, the univariate Cox model subanalysis revealed prognostic factors for 3 year mortality were the same for ATTRwt patients (N = 500) and ATTRv patients SBP, ALP, troponin T hs, NT‐ProBNP, eGFR, tricuspid insufficiency, and GLS. However, due to the limited ATTRv sample (N = 100), only SBP, tricuspid insufficiency, troponin T hs, and eGFR were included in the multivariate Cox model. In this subset, Troponin T hs emerged as the only predictor of 3 year mortality (HR = 1.105, 95% CI: 1.101–1.420).

Considering the similar survival rates observed among geriatric patients with NAC stage 2 and 3 and the independent and robust predictive value of troponin T hs and ALP for mortality, these two biomarkers were investigated and respective threshold values established. This analysis allowed us to develop a new geriatric cardiac amyloidosis stratification, GCA staging, into 3 stages defined as follows: Stage 3 corresponds to cases with both high sensitivity troponin T ≥ 44 ng/L and ALP ≥ 119 UI/L, Stage 2 includes patients with either high sensitivity troponin T ≥ 44 ng/L or ALP ≥ 119 UI/L, and Stage 1 includes patients where neither value exceeds the threshold value (see Figure S4).

Applying this new stratification to the geriatric population, 121 patients were categorized as Stage 1, 286 as Stage 2, and 131 as Stage 3. Subsequently, survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier approach demonstrated a 3 year survival rate of 82% for Stage 1 patients, with a median survival that was not reached. For Stage 2, the 3 year survival rate was 50%, with a median survival of 36 months (95% CI: 30–36). In contrast, Stage 3 patients had a 3 year survival rate of 32%, with a median survival of 17 months (95% CI: 8–24) (Figure

5C
).

Concerning ATTR‐CM subtype, the ATTRwt population with a larger sample size (453) than ATTRv (83), had distinct mortality prognosis rates for patient in GCA 1 (86%), 2 (66%), and 3 (45%) with median survival of 17 months (95% CI: 14–28) for Stage 3 (P < 0.001). Among ATTRv patients, despite the smaller sample size, we observed prognostic differences between stage 1 (89%) and stages 2 (52%) and 3 (34%) median survival at 14 months (95% CI: 9–23, P = 0.001) (Figure

5Diii
 and

).

This new survival stratification was applied to non‐geriatric patients based on their amyloidosis subtype. This stratification also proved to be relevant for this population, as survival curves for stages 1, 2, and 3 exhibited statistically significant differences in prognosis at 3 years (
5Biii
 and 
5Biv
).

Comparing these two prognostic Cox models demonstrated a statistical difference for the new stratification among geriatric patients. The likelihood ratio was stronger compared with the NAC staging (34.567 vs. 50.025), with a good concordance of 0.76 (Kappa) and significant P value (<0.03) (Figures

5Aii
 and 
5C
).

### Study population

In total, the CARC received 2948 referrals between 2008 and 2020. Of these, 2005 patients were excluded for having a confirmed diagnosis other than ATTR‐CM. This left 943 patients with confirmed ATTR‐CM. Among these, 306 patients had ATTRv and 637 had ATTRwt, and most (64.9%, n = 612) were geriatric (age >75 years) (Figure

1
 and Table

1
).

ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine transaminase; AoS, aortic stenosis; AST, aspartate transaminase; BMI, body mass index; GGT, gamma‐glutamyl transferase; IVS, interventricular septum; LV, left ventricle; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MDRD, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation; NYHA, New York Heart Association Classification; TR, tricuspid regurgitation.

Most ATTR patients included in the study were male in both non‐geriatric and geriatric age groups. In the ATTRwt patient subgroup, a larger proportion were of European origin other than Portuguese, whereas the ATTRv patient group included diverse ethnic backgrounds, of European, Portuguese, Afro‐Caribbean, sub‐Saharan African, and North African origin (Table

1
 and Table

S1
).

Among ATTRv patients, ATTR Val122Ile was the most prevalent mutation in all age groups and the only variant identified in patients older than 85 years. Among geriatric patients, ATTR Val30Met was the second most commonly observed mutation (Figure 
S1
).

### Cardiac characteristics, history, and disease markers

Cardiac characteristics for the total population age and subtype are shown in Tables

1
, 
2
, and 
3
. NYHA cardiac severity was notably more severe among geriatric patients in both subgroups. Concerning previous cardiac event history, having a pacemaker, atrial fibrillation, or ischaemic cardiopathologies were most prevalent, irrespective of patient age. Cardiac amyloidosis symptoms appeared earlier among non‐geriatric patients, as demonstrated in Table

1
 and Figure

S2
.

Median cardiac and hepatic biomarker levels increased with age. Specifically, troponin T hs and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, which progressively increased with increasing age in both ATTRwt and ATTRv populations.

Echocardiographic findings revealed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower among geriatric patients than non‐geriatric patients overall. However, differences were observed between ATTR subtypes. With advancing age, LVEF tended to decrease among ATTRv patients, but remained relatively stable among ATTRwt patients. Interestingly, LVEF approached near‐normal levels in patients aged over 90 years in both subpopulations. Although the interventricular septum thickness was similar in both geriatric and non‐geriatric populations, significantly thicker LV wall, decreased LV volume and more severe LV global strain was observed among geriatric patients. These findings varied between subtypes with advancing age. While all echocardiographic measurements worsened among geriatric ATTRv patients, only the LV volume significantly decreased in the geriatric ATTRwt subgroup.

The proportion of patients with moderate to severe AS was significantly higher among geriatric patients in both the ATTRwt and ATTRv subgroups. Additionally, among geriatric, ATTRwt patients, moderate and severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) occurred more frequently.

### Extracardiac signs and symptoms according to age

Extracardiac symptoms reported at diagnosis for the whole population are described in Table

1
, according to subtype in Tables

2
 and 
3
 and illustrated in Figures

2
 and 
3
. Overall, peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal issues occurred more frequently among non‐geriatric patients but the frequency of hearing loss increased with age (Figure

2
A
).

Peripheral neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, hearing loss and digestive symptoms differ according to age, ATTR‐CM subtype (ATTRwt and ATTRwt). Histogram (A) illustrates extracardiac symptoms in the total transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) population. Histogram (B) illustrates, hearing loss occurred more frequently in all age groups than other extracardiac symptoms among ATTRwt. Histogram (C) illustrates more patients presented with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy or orthostatic hypotension among the non‐geriatric ATTRv patients.

Histogram (A) Illustrates a general decline in carpal tunnel symptoms or surgery with age. Histogram (B) Illustrates history of carpal tunnel symptoms and surgery decreased with age among ATTRwt. Histogram (C) illustrates symptoms and surgery increased with age, among ATTRv patients.

In the ATTRv subgroup, the proportion of patients with symptomatic peripheral neuropathy and/or orthostatic hypotension was significantly higher among non‐geriatric patients. Conversely, reports of carpal tunnel symptoms, associated surgeries, and hearing loss increased with advancing age in ATTRv (Figures

2
C
 and 
3
C
).

In the ATTRwt subgroup, extracardiac symptoms were observed in approximately a quarter of the population and hearing loss was prevalent in approximately two‐thirds of patients across all age groups. Importantly, the time between the onset of extracardiac amyloidosis symptoms and diagnosis did not differ with age. Fewer ATTRwt geriatric individuals reported carpal tunnel syndrome (Figures

2
 and 
3
).

### Cardiac amyloidosis stages at diagnosis and amyloidosis treatment

Overall, most geriatric patients exhibited a more severe cardiac condition, classified as NAC stage II and III, compared with non‐geriatric patients. However, it is worth noting that among the seven patients diagnosed with ATTRv who were over 85 years old, three were at stage I, four at stage II, and none at stage III. In contrast, among ATTRwt patients, the incidence of stage III increased with age. Among those patients who presented at 90 years or older, and for whom renal function tests were available, fewer were at stage II and more at stage I and III (Figure 
4
). No significant differences were found in the proportion of patients receiving tafamidis treatment between non‐geriatric and geriatric patients (Table 
2
).

### Survival

Survival for the total ATTR‐CM population by age groups is illustrated in the Kaplan–Meier survival curves (Figure 
S3
). Overall, 315 patients died during the 3 year follow‐up and the overall median survival time from study inclusion was 18 months (95% CI: 7–30). After 3 years, survival was significantly lower among older patients [43%, at 16 months (95% CI: 5–22) > 85 years], than younger patients (log rank P‐value <0.001). However, median survival was similar between those aged between 75–79 and 80–84 years [55%, at 17 months (95% CI: 8–30)].

### Survival according to National Amyloidosis Centre classification

When the population was classified according to NAC scoring, we observed that survival rates diverged between the non‐geriatric and geriatric groups. Among non‐geriatric patients, a clear distinction was observed between stage 2 and 3. For Stage 1, the median survival was not reached, and the 3‐year mortality rate was 86.2%. Stage 2 exhibited a median survival of 30 months (95% CI: 23–34), while stage 3 showed a median survival of 25 months (95% CI: 17–28), with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) (Figure
5Ai). Surprisingly, the 3 year survival rate was the same for both NAC stage 2 and 3 in the geriatric population (40%), median survival 26 months (95% CI: 13–27) (Figure 5Aii
4
B
). Survival did not differ between geriatric patients with ATTRv and ATTRwt for the three NAC stages at 3 years, with a log rank P‐value of 0.456 and 0.561, respectively

### Predictive factors of mortality

In the non‐geriatric population, the prognostic factors of mortality on multivariate cox analysis were SBP, log NT‐proBNP (HR = 1.002, 95% CI: 1.02–1.04), global longitudinal strain (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.922–0.989), and glomerular filtration rate (HR = 0.984, 95% CI: 0.968–1.00) (Table 
4
).

Predictors of mortality in the non‐geriatric and geriatric population

In the geriatric population, the prognostic factors of mortality on multivariate Cox analysis were systolic blood pressure (SBP) (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98–0.89), ALP (HR = 1.004, 95% CI: 0.001–1.100), troponin T hs (HR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.001–1.120), tricuspid insufficiency (HR = 1.194, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23), and ischaemic cardiomyopathy (Table 
4
).

Concerning geriatric ATTR subtype, the univariate Cox model subanalysis revealed prognostic factors for 3 year mortality were the same for ATTRwt patients (N = 500) and ATTRv patients SBP, ALP, troponin T hs, NT‐ProBNP, eGFR, tricuspid insufficiency, and GLS. However, due to the limited ATTRv sample (N = 100), only SBP, tricuspid insufficiency, troponin T hs, and eGFR were included in the multivariate Cox model. In this subset, Troponin T hs emerged as the only predictor of 3 year mortality (HR = 1.105, 95% CI: 1.101–1.420).

### Proposal for a new staging for geriatric cardiac amyloidosis population

Considering the similar survival rates observed among geriatric patients with NAC stage 2 and 3 and the independent and robust predictive value of troponin T hs and ALP for mortality, these two biomarkers were investigated and respective threshold values established. This analysis allowed us to develop a new geriatric cardiac amyloidosis stratification, GCA staging, into 3 stages defined as follows: Stage 3 corresponds to cases with both high sensitivity troponin T ≥ 44 ng/L and ALP ≥ 119 UI/L, Stage 2 includes patients with either high sensitivity troponin T ≥ 44 ng/L or ALP ≥ 119 UI/L, and Stage 1 includes patients where neither value exceeds the threshold value (see Figure S4).

Applying this new stratification to the geriatric population, 121 patients were categorized as Stage 1, 286 as Stage 2, and 131 as Stage 3. Subsequently, survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier approach demonstrated a 3 year survival rate of 82% for Stage 1 patients, with a median survival that was not reached. For Stage 2, the 3 year survival rate was 50%, with a median survival of 36 months (95% CI: 30–36). In contrast, Stage 3 patients had a 3 year survival rate of 32%, with a median survival of 17 months (95% CI: 8–24) (Figure

5C
).

Concerning ATTR‐CM subtype, the ATTRwt population with a larger sample size (453) than ATTRv (83), had distinct mortality prognosis rates for patient in GCA 1 (86%), 2 (66%), and 3 (45%) with median survival of 17 months (95% CI: 14–28) for Stage 3 (P < 0.001). Among ATTRv patients, despite the smaller sample size, we observed prognostic differences between stage 1 (89%) and stages 2 (52%) and 3 (34%) median survival at 14 months (95% CI: 9–23, P = 0.001) (Figure

5Diii
 and 
5Div
).

This new survival stratification was applied to non‐geriatric patients based on their amyloidosis subtype. This stratification also proved to be relevant for this population, as survival curves for stages 1, 2, and 3 exhibited statistically significant differences in prognosis at 3 years (
5Biii
 and 
5Biv
).

Comparing these two prognostic Cox models demonstrated a statistical difference for the new stratification among geriatric patients. The likelihood ratio was stronger compared with the NAC staging (34.567 vs. 50.025), with a good concordance of 0.76 (Kappa) and significant P value (<0.03) (Figures

5Aii
 and 
5C
).

### Discussion

This retrospective study describes the clinical, biological, and cardiac characteristics, as well as prognostic factors that contribute to mortality in patients with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy (ATTR‐CM). These characteristics and prognostic factors have been compared between geriatric and non‐geriatric populations to identify cardiac and extracardiac amyloidosis characteristics associated with ATTR‐CM across varying age groups and genotypes.

The primary focus of this study is the geriatric population, considering the distinctive nature of this group, which often presents with concomitant, co‐morbid conditions.

Cardiac symptoms, including rhythm disorders and heart failure, occurred significantly earlier in non‐geriatric populations, suggesting a more precocious manifestation of cardiac ATTR. In contrast, the onset of extracardiac symptoms appears to be similar across age groups. Also, the study demonstrates that the cardiac phenotype and the levels of cardiac and hepatic markers differ between geriatric and non‐geriatric populations, regardless of the amyloidosis subtype, leading to differences in 3 year mortality prognostic factors. Furthermore, the NAC staging was not sufficiently discriminatory in terms of prognosis in the geriatric population as in other patients. This prompted us to propose a new prognostic stratification called GCA for a more tailored approach to this frail and distinct population.

We observed a significant prevalence of cardiac signs related to ATTR‐CM in patients younger than 75 years,
24
 especially when compared with the geriatric population.
25
 Whereas, prior research has indicated the presence of atrial fibrillation,
26
 ischaemic heart disease, implanted pacemakers,
27
 and signs of heart failure in older individuals.
13
 These findings corroborate studies that highlight the early emergence of cardiac indicators associated with ATTR‐CM. This reinforces the importance of recognizing amyloidosis as a condition that frequently occurs among older individuals exhibiting early cardiac symptoms, offering valuable insights for geriatricians to identify cardiac amyloidosis. Notably, the elevated prevalence of implanted pacemakers in this group suggests that an earlier diagnosis of amyloidosis may have been feasible.
28

Extracardiac signs are particularly pertinent for geriatricians as they contribute to increased frailty risk factors.
29
 We observed that extracardiac warning signs were common, affecting 30–60% of all ATTR‐CM patients.

Concerning ATTRwt patients, approximately 60% of patients across all age groups experienced hearing loss. Conversely, among those with ATTRv, younger patients presented neurological symptoms, whereas older patients presented with hearing loss.
30

Additionally, dysautonomia exacerbates frailty, which is a significant morbidity factor and further aggravated by peripheral neurological involvement induced by diabetes and other prevalent metabolic conditions among elderly patients.

Furthermore, these symptoms manifest rapidly in wild‐type amyloidosis diagnosed before the age of 75, and this important aspect is often overlooked or poorly understood by healthcare professionals, potentially leading to diagnostic errors.

Also, a high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome or related surgical interventions, was observed in approximately 50–70% of the population. Carpal tunnel syndrome was prominent among geriatric patients with ATTRv, consistent with prior reports.32, 33, 34, 35 We observed a marked decrease in prevalence on geriatric ATTRwt, which remains a puzzle to explain. One might expect amyloid proteins to accumulate in the joints as the disease progresses.
31

We observed a correlation between the prevalence of LV thickening, decreasing LV diameter, and increasing atrial volume severity with age,
32
 Specifically, patients with ATTRwt had more severe hypertrophy and earlier thickening compared with those with ATTRv. These findings align with the underlying pathophysiological basis of amyloidosis and are consistent with results from the THAOS study.
1

The pathophysiological changes that occur with cardiac amyloidosis result in concentric ventricular remodelling with reduced systolic ejection volume and cardiac output. This leads to rapid exercise intolerance with signs of heart failure despite preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

We observed a notable prevalence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and grade 3–4 tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and this prevalence increased with advancing age, in line with findings from other European studies.
33
, 
34

This observation was particularly significant within the ATTRwt population, where the proportion of patients with AS was significantly higher among geriatric individuals compared with their non‐geriatric counterparts (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the occurrence of TR also exhibits an age‐related increase. Conversely, among patients with ATTRv, moderate AS and TR are slightly more prevalent in individuals younger than 84 years.
35
, 
36
, 
37

Aortic stenosis and significant tricuspid regurgitation are known to be prognostic factors in amyloidosis and all cardiac diseases. The geriatric population is the most affected by these conditions, which may explain the differences in prognostic models between the two populations.

Notably, the prevalence of ATTRv in our geriatric patient cohort was 16%. This means that incorporating genetic TTR testing into cardiac assessments is important, even for older individuals.
38
 Having an understanding the patient's genetic profile is beneficial for their own clinical management but also their family members who may seek genetic counselling.
39

Interestingly, we also found the ATTRv Val122Ile mutation was particularly prevalent among individuals of Afro‐Caribbean descent
40
 across all age groups, which is in line with the American THAOS and other recent data
41
 but contrasts with Rapezzi et al. who showed that most ATTRv patients were from European origin in their Italian cohort.
9
 This highlights the need for geriatricians to actively screen for ATTR amyloidosis among patients with heart failure and African ancestry.

We observed the Kaplan–Meier survival curves were notably similar between NAC stage 2 and 3 when geriatric ATTR patients were stratified by NAC score. This raises the possibility that the NAC prognostic score may lack the precision needed to differentiate the prognosis among these older patient groups. The description of the population based on age at diagnosis allowed us to observe that cardiac markers and biology differed between age group. This reflects two distinct modes of presentation between geriatric and non‐geriatric patients.

This is important consideration, as the variables utilized in the Gillmore score, specifically NT‐proBNP and glomerular filtration rate, correspond to independent prognostic factors that are highly relevant in the non‐geriatric population but have diminished relevance in elderly patients.
16

The value of glomerular filtration rate is challenging to interpret with age, and its decline is multifactorial (vascular, metabolic, and polypharmacy).

A substantial proportion of our geriatric cohort (ranging from 80% to 93.3%) received tafamidis treatment. While this treatment stabilizes disease progression and modified NT‐proBNP levels, the geriatric population typically exhibits more pronounced renal dysfunction, potentially influencing the NAC score outcomes.

The variation in cardiac phenotype and cardiac and hepatic markers, coupled with their association with multiple hidden and likely underestimated co‐morbidity factors in the geriatric population, lead us to consider that prognostic markers are likely to differ. Using the multivariate model that predominantly included biological and echocardiographic parameters, we demonstrated that mortality prognostic factors for geriatric patients differ from those for non‐geriatric patients. This supports our initial hypothesis that the pathphysiology of early and advanced cardiac amyloidosis differ.

We consistently observe that troponin, alkaline phosphatase, TR and systolic blood pressure, are significant prognostic factors of mortality at 3 years. These parameters are known for their prognostic value in the elderly and in advanced or restrictive heart failure populations. The reduction in blood pressure reflects autonomic dysfunction and the fragility of elderly individuals. Severe tricuspid insufficiency has been identified as a strong prognostic factor in several studies, as has troponin, which becomes the predominant cardiac marker of mortality compared with NT‐proBNP. This change may be due to a different disease progression or a multifactorial microcirculation impairment leading to silent ischaemia, especially considering that many of these patients are diabetic and have multivessel disease.

ALP or cholestasis merely reflects the consequences of right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. We are more accustomed recording bilirubin levels, but in ATTR amyloidosis, ALP appears to be an earlier and fairly potent prognostic marker, as corroborated by the decision tree used to construct the cut off values for the new stratification.

The geriatric cardiac amyloidosis (GCA) stratification system developed in this study, based on troponin T hs and ALP (two readily available and interpretable biological markers), enables a more refined risk assessment of the geriatric population, particularly those with ATTRwt. This novel prognostic approach enables physicians to evaluate patients from a right heart perspective. Evaluating the right heart involvement makes it easier to identify elderly individuals at high mortality risk. This is crucial because these high‐risk patients may possibly have advanced or even end‐stage disease. Furthermore, as the ATTR patient population continues to age, making therapeutic decisions and assessing therapeutic responses becomes increasingly challenging.

Further research with updated statistical tools such as supervised clustering modelling is required to strengthen and confirm these prognostic values and validate a score based on more diverse prognostic factors. Specifically, the role of tricuspid valve insufficiency, right ventricular dysfunction or frailty, which have been less explored to date. Also, as most patients in France have been treated with tafamidis, it would be useful to perform a comparative analysis over time between treated and untreated populations. This would be a valuable opportunity to study this older population to further understand the role and impact of tafamidis on cardiac involvement and phenotype with aging. Furthermore, co‐morbidities inherent to advancing age can significantly impact survival in patients with ATTR‐CM. Notably, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease can independently increase mortality risk and reduce quality of life. Also, these co‐morbidities often make managing medication and potential drug interactions more challenging. Lastly, epidemiological research is needed to further understand the clinical characteristics we observed among patients >90 years to confirm whether this group may be a different phenotype from the other ATTR patients.

The single‐centre recruitment approach employed in this study should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the absence of a control group limits the statistical robustness of the results. The retrospective nature of the study constrained data collection, especially with regard to comprehensive extracardiac co‐morbidities, patient autonomy, and lifestyle factors. Additionally, we did not conduct a geriatric assessment that could have evaluated patient frailty more precisely.

We encountered biases typically associated with retrospective studies, including issues related to data collection, patient attrition, and the centre‐based effect on patients who were on a tafamidis regimen, with follow‐ups every 6 months.

Regarding MRI, when possible to perform, is a key examination in our diagnostic panel. However, the extensive, comprehensive MRI results have not been analysed in this study.

In our mortality analysis, we included all‐cause deaths and we did not perform a survival study specifically focusing on cardiac‐related deaths. Additionally, our prognostic model did not incorporate the effects of treatments and tafamidis.

Study strengths include the large number of patients with a predominance of geriatric patients, a heterogeneous population, follow‐up over several years and the collection and analysis of a wide range of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data.

### The importance of medical history in the natural history of transthyretin amyloidosis

We observed a significant prevalence of cardiac signs related to ATTR‐CM in patients younger than 75 years,
24
 especially when compared with the geriatric population.
25
 Whereas, prior research has indicated the presence of atrial fibrillation,
26

Notably, the elevated prevalence of implanted pacemakers in this group suggests that an earlier diagnosis of amyloidosis may have been feasible.
28

### Extracardiac signs according to age and subtype

Extracardiac signs are particularly pertinent for geriatricians as they contribute to increased frailty risk factors.
29
 We observed that extracardiac warning signs were common, affecting 30–60% of all ATTR‐CM patients.

Concerning ATTRwt patients, approximately 60% of patients across all age groups experienced hearing loss. Conversely, among those with ATTRv, younger patients presented neurological symptoms, whereas older patients presented with hearing loss.

Aortic stenosis and significant tricuspid regurgitation are known to be prognostic factors in amyloidosis and all cardiac diseases. The geriatric population is the most affected by these conditions, which may explain the differences in prognostic models between the two populations.

### Genotyping may be valuable in the geriatric population

Notably, the prevalence of ATTRv in our geriatric patient cohort was 16%. This means that incorporating genetic TTR testing into cardiac assessments is important, even for older individuals.

 This highlights the need for geriatricians to actively screen for ATTR amyloidosis among patients with heart failure and African ancestry.

### Role of National Amyloidosis Centre staging in the geriatric population

We observed the Kaplan–Meier survival curves were notably similar between NAC stage 2 and 3 when geriatric ATTR patients were stratified by NAC score. This raises the possibility that the NAC prognostic score may lack the precision needed to differentiate the prognosis among these older patient groups. The description of the population based on age at diagnosis allowed us to observe that cardiac markers and biology differed between age group. This reflects two distinct modes of presentation between geriatric and non‐geriatric patients.

This is important consideration, as the variables utilized in the Gillmore score, specifically NT‐proBNP and glomerular filtration rate, correspond to independent prognostic factors that are highly relevant in the non‐geriatric population but have diminished relevance in elderly patients.
16

The value of glomerular filtration rate is challenging to interpret with age, and its decline is multifactorial (vascular, metabolic, and polypharmacy).

A substantial proportion of our geriatric cohort (ranging from 80% to 93.3%) received tafamidis treatment. While this treatment stabilizes disease progression and modified NT‐proBNP levels, the geriatric population typically exhibits more pronounced renal dysfunction, potentially influencing the NAC score outcomes.

### A new geriatric cardiac amyloidosis prognostic stratification

The variation in cardiac phenotype and cardiac and hepatic markers, coupled with their association with multiple hidden and likely underestimated co‐morbidity factors in the geriatric population, lead us to consider that prognostic markers are likely to differ. Using the multivariate model that predominantly included biological and echocardiographic parameters, we demonstrated that mortality prognostic factors for geriatric patients differ from those for non‐geriatric patients. This supports our initial hypothesis that the pathphysiology of early and advanced cardiac amyloidosis differ.

We consistently observe that troponin, alkaline phosphatase, TR and systolic blood pressure, are significant prognostic factors of mortality at 3 years. These parameters are known for their prognostic value in the elderly and in advanced or restrictive heart failure populations. The reduction in blood pressure reflects autonomic dysfunction and the fragility of elderly individuals. Severe tricuspid insufficiency has been identified as a strong prognostic factor in several studies, as has troponin, which becomes the predominant cardiac marker of mortality compared with NT‐proBNP. This change may be due to a different disease progression or a multifactorial microcirculation impairment leading to silent ischaemia, especially considering that many of these patients are diabetic and have multivessel disease.

ALP or cholestasis merely reflects the consequences of right heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. We are more accustomed recording bilirubin levels, but in ATTR amyloidosis, ALP appears to be an earlier and fairly potent prognostic marker, as corroborated by the decision tree used to construct the cut off values for the new stratification.

The geriatric cardiac amyloidosis (GCA) stratification system developed in this study, based on troponin T hs and ALP (two readily available and interpretable biological markers), enables a more refined risk assessment of the geriatric population, particularly those with ATTRwt. This novel prognostic approach enables physicians to evaluate patients from a right heart perspective. Evaluating the right heart involvement makes it easier to identify elderly individuals at high mortality risk. This is crucial because these high‐risk patients may possibly have advanced or even end‐stage disease. Furthermore, as the ATTR patient population continues to age, making therapeutic decisions and assessing therapeutic responses becomes increasingly challenging.

### Future perspectives

Further research with updated statistical tools such as supervised clustering modelling is required to strengthen and confirm these prognostic values and validate a score based on more diverse prognostic factors. Specifically, the role of tricuspid valve insufficiency, right ventricular dysfunction or frailty, which have been less explored to date. Also, as most patients in France have been treated with tafamidis, it would be useful to perform a comparative analysis over time between treated and untreated populations. This would be a valuable opportunity to study this older population to further understand the role and impact of tafamidis on cardiac involvement and phenotype with aging. Furthermore, co‐morbidities inherent to advancing age can significantly impact survival in patients with ATTR‐CM. Notably, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease can independently increase mortality risk and reduce quality of life. Also, these co‐morbidities often make managing medication and potential drug interactions more challenging. Lastly, epidemiological research is needed to further understand the clinical characteristics we observed among patients >90 years to confirm whether this group may be a different phenotype from the other ATTR patients.

### Strengths and limitations

The single‐centre recruitment approach employed in this study should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, the absence of a control group limits the statistical robustness of the results. The retrospective nature of the study constrained data collection, especially with regard to comprehensive extracardiac co‐morbidities, patient autonomy, and lifestyle factors. Additionally, we did not conduct a geriatric assessment that could have evaluated patient frailty more precisely.

We encountered biases typically associated with retrospective studies, including issues related to data collection, patient attrition, and the centre‐based effect on patients who were on a tafamidis regimen, with follow‐ups every 6 months.

Regarding MRI, when possible to perform, is a key examination in our diagnostic panel. However, the extensive, comprehensive MRI results have not been analysed in this study.

In our mortality analysis, we included all‐cause deaths and we did not perform a survival study specifically focusing on cardiac‐related deaths. Additionally, our prognostic model did not incorporate the effects of treatments and tafamidis.

Study strengths include the large number of patients with a predominance of geriatric patients, a heterogeneous population, follow‐up over several years and the collection and analysis of a wide range of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data.

### Conclusions

This study revealed that ATTR‐CM exhibits diverse clinical, biological, and echocardiographic presentations, alongside extracardiac amyloid signs. This reflects distinct geriatric and non‐geriatric phenotypes.

Cardiac symptoms appear earlier than extracardiac symptoms in patients younger than 75 years of age compared with older patients. This allows for early diagnosis and may avoid progression to more advanced forms at later ages.

Also, the different geriatric and non‐geriatric phenotype likely contributes to the different in prognostic factors observed. Consequently, we have identified distinct and more suitable prognostic markers for this age group, and cut‐off values that facilitate a novel risk stratification approach for geriatric ATTR‐CM patients independent of their genotype. This approach appears more pertinent than the NAC staging, which is better suited for younger populations.

Moreover, within the geriatric population, we identified individuals with mutated forms featuring the ATTR Val122Ile mutation. This prompts us to consider offering genotyping to elderly patients.

Finally, patients aged over 90 years displayed a different phenotype, indicative of a unique manifestation of the aging process and cardiac amyloid deposits.
