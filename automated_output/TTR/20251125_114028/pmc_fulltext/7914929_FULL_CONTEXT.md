## Amyloid polyneuropathy in two German-American families: a new transthyretin variant (Val 107).

### Abstract

We report studies on two German-American persons with systemic amyloidosis. Affected subjects presented with carpal tunnel syndrome in the sixth decade of life followed by peripheral neuropathy. DNA analysis of the transthyretin gene showed a new point mutation which is responsible for substitution of valine for isoleucine at position 107 of the transthyretin molecule.Images
