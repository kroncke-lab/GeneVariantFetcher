## Cardiac Amyloidosis and its New Clinical Phenotype: Heart Failure
with Preserved Ejection Fraction

### Abstract

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is now an emerging
cardiovascular epidemic, being identified as the main phenotype observed in
clinical practice. It is more associated with female gender, advanced age and
comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney
disease. Amyloidosis is a clinical disorder characterized by the deposition of
aggregates of insoluble fibrils originating from proteins that exhibit anomalous
folding. Recently, pictures of senile amyloidosis have been described in
patients with HFpEF, demonstrating the need for clinical cardiologists to
investigate this etiology in suspect cases. The clinical suspicion of
amyloidosis should be increased in cases of HFPS where the cardio imaging
methods are compatible with infiltrative cardiomyopathy. Advances in cardio
imaging methods combined with the possibility of performing genetic tests and
identification of the type of amyloid material allow the diagnosis to be made.
The management of the diagnosed patients can be done in partnership with centers
specialized in the study of amyloidosis, which, together with the new
technologies, investigate the possibility of organ or bone marrow
transplantation and also the involvement of patients in clinical studies that
evaluate the action of the new emerging drugs.

### Introduction

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejectionfFraction (HFpEF) is now an emerging
cardiovascular epidemic, being identified as the main phenotype observed in clinical
practice in different countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Portugal
and Brazil. It is more associated with female gender, advanced age, and
comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney
disease.1-6 Recently, a picture of senile amyloidosis has been
described in patients with HFpEF, demonstrating the need for clinical cardiologists
to investigate this etiology. Advances in cardio imaging methods combined with the
possibility of performing genetic tests and identification of the type of amyloid
material allow for greater ease in the diagnostic process in view of the clinical
suspicion of the disease.7-15

Amyloidosis is a clinical disorder resulting from the deposition of insoluble fibril
aggregates originated from proteins that have anomalous folding. These proteins,
mostly initially soluble and with alpha helix configuration, take the pleated beta
form through the abnormal folding phenomenon, with tissue precipitation in the form
of amyloid fibrillar aggregates. These aggregates have the characteristic of
staining congo red, acquiring a shade described as "apple-green" in polarized light.
Through the alteration of the affected organ, it determines numerous dysfunctions of
irreversible, progressive and indolent course, as observed in cardiac
amyloidosis.7,10,16-23

Cardiac involvement may lead to the development of a restrictive HF model. Deposits
in the myocardium and blood vessels cause diastolic, systolic dysfunction, ischemia
and arrhythmias, and late diagnosis is the main cause of the reduction of survival
of these patients.7,10,16-23

The diagnosis of amyloidosis presents important non-invasive advances in
characterizing its presence and its type. In the past, the diagnosis was centered on
the endomyocardial biopsy stained by congo red. More recently, new techniques such
as doppler echocardiography with analysis of myocardial strain, myocardial
scintigraphy with radioisotopes such as Tc99m bound to pyrophosphate or
2,3-dicarboxypropane-1,1-diphosphonate (DPD) and magnetic resonance imaging of blood
tests for genotyping evaluation have promoted important advances in this
area.11,12

New treatments directed toward specific disease targets have already been
incorporated into clinical practice and others are still being tested, gradually
improving patients' survival and quality of life.24,25

According to data obtained in MedLine, publications on the cardiac amyloidosis
framework date back to 1948, totaling over 1000 articles indexed in several
languages. Over the last five years, there has been a continuous increase in the
number of studies evaluating the various aspects of the disease, especially with
regard to innovations in diagnostic methods and new therapies (Figure 1). This trend is confirmed by the fact that the material
produced in the last five years represents a third of the total published so
far.26

The increase in the number of studies on the disease provides sufficient evidence for
physicians to increase their clinical suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis, especially
of the senile type, in cases of HFpEF, and referral of these patients to specialized
centers is recommended. At these sites, invasive and non-invasive diagnostic methods
allow for a wide assessment, including genetic testing, multidisciplinary teaming,
and access to new drugs.

In this present review we will discuss the recent advances in the etiology and
pathophysiology of cardiac amyloidosis, especially the senile form, in a
systematized way for the evaluation of individuals suspected of amyloidosis in the
context of HFpEF and the emerging therapies currently available in clinical
practice.

In the face of the complexity associated with the disease and its multiplicity of
presentations, specific nomenclatures and classifications were established
related to the predisposing condition and to the type of amyloid fibril
deposited in the tissue. In general, amyloidosis can be classified as primary,
secondary, related to dialysis and associated with transthyretin.27-30

It is classified as primary amyloidosis (AL) when it is defined by the production
of amyloid protein composed of light chain immunoglobulins (kappa and lambda),
synthesized under clinical conditions that present plasmacyclic dyscrasias, such
as multiple myeloma and, less frequently, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Classically, AL is a systemic disease that
predominates in an older population and in male individuals.27,31

The clinical picture varies directly with the organ of predominance of amyloid
deposition and its degree of functional impairment. The two most commonly
affected organs are the kidney and heart, accounting for 60-80% of patients in
most studies. Kidney involvement manifests as nephrotic syndrome or asymptomatic
proteinuria. Cardiac involvement is related to the development of a HFpSC, in
addition to the possible involvement of the heart conduction system and its
corresponding complications. Autonomic neuropathy, or sensitivomotor peripheral
neuropathy, may be present in up to 20% of patients.27,32-34

The accumulation of the amyloid material in the liver is frequent and comes along
with isolated hepatomegaly or even hepatosplenomegaly, and may present a pattern
of elevation of liver enzymes, compatible with cholestasis. Muscular
infiltration may occur with pseudohypertrophy, as in classical macroglossia, as
well as arthropathy due to deposits in the joints. Periorbital purpura
(raccoon's eyes), despite being an uncommon finding, is strongly characteristic
of the AL form. Hemorrhagic diathesis is an important condition that may be
present and reports as possible causal links the connection between amyloid
material's with coagulation factor X, the reduced synthesis of coagulation
factors in the presence of a compromised liver and a possible acquired von
Willebrand's disease.27,32-34

Secondary amyloidosis (AA) is identified in chronic inflammatory clinical
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and, more recently,
autoinflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, Mediterranean
family fever, and Muckle-Wells syndrome. Fibrils are composed of the amyloid A
protein and are produced by the liver during the acute phase of inflammatory
diseases. This protein originally has the function of increasing the affinity of
high density lipoprotein (HDL) by macrophages and adipocytes, as well as
mediating the chemoattraction and induction of the synthesis of proinflammatory
cytokines. The chronic inflammatory picture increases its synthesis and, due to
incorrect processing with cleavage and erroneous folding, results in its
pathogenic form. The kidneys are involved in approximately 80% of patients,
being the organ most affected by AA. However, there are also reports of cardiac
involvement.27,35-37

Dialysis-related amyloidosis occurs as a function of the deposition of fibrils
originating from beta-2 microglobulin proteins, which accumulate at increasing
levels in patients with advanced renal disease and who undergo long-term
dialysis. In this form, in particular, the predominant condition is
osteoarticular involvement, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and rotator cuff
involvement.38,39

Cardiac amyloidosis associated with transthyretin (TTR) is the second form of
amyloidosis with a higher prevalence of cardiac involvement, and may be divided
into hereditary and senile forms. The precursor protein is predominantly
synthesized in the liver and plays a role as a carrier of retinol and
thyroxine.10,14-18

In the senile form, we identifie tissue deposition of the TTR wild form,
especially in the myocardium, and a clinical picture of HF is observed. The
association with carpal tunnel syndrome has been described, whereas renal
involvement is a rare finding. It has been observed in necropsy studies that
deposition of this amyloid material in the heart is a frequent finding,
especially in previously asymptomatic patients.22 Data from the Mayo Clinic group indicate that
the prevalence of this form among patients with amyloidosis is approximately
8,5%, with a mean age of 77 years and the male sex representing 82% of the
affected individuals. It has been found that it rarely occurs in patients below
70 years of age. Observational study, observed that patients usually have a slow
progression and a survival, after the diagnosis, of approximately 43 months,
compared to the 26.6 months of the mutant form.18,40-42

The hereditary form, unlike senile, affects patients in different age groups, but
predominates a mean age lower than that found in patients with the senile form.
The coding of TTR occurs on chromosome 18 and more than 70 mutations associated
with this protein have been identified. In view of the suspicion of an
amyloidosis by TTR, the sequencing of this protein from tissue or blood sample
should be performed for the diagnosis and identification of a possible specific
mutation that allows us to define the prognostic course of the patient and guide
the investigation of the relatives. The Val122Ile mutation is more associated
with the elderly and is predominantly male, presenting in 90% of the cases a
clinical manifestation of a cardiomyopathy.7,10,14,15

The most prevalent mutation in the world population is Val30Met, which presents
marked neurological involvement, allied to a late cardiac involvement and is
related to Corino de Andrade's disease, also known as familial amyloid
polyneurophaty (FAP), which occurs along with sensory-motor peripheral
polyneuropathy. Manifests, especially, at the age of 20 years, characterized by
paresthesias, motor and autonomic disorders, besides studying with cardiac and
renal impairment in the late phase of the disease. This condition has been
identified as a genetic disease associated with the TTR mutation.7,10,14,22

Amyloidosis cardiomyopathy is classically described as a directt HF model, often
occuring together with ascites, predating lower limb edema and allying with
hepatomegaly on physical examination. Unlike cardiac dysfunction with increased
filling pressures, pulmonary edema is an infrequent condition in amyloidosis
cardiomyopathy.7,8,10,14

A rarer phenotype is the involvement of the interventricular septum with deposit
of the amyloid material promoting the disproportionate thickening of the region,
mimicking a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This presentation constitutes what is
called a phenocopia, that is, a clinical condition that presents itself through
manifestations typical of a disease of well-defined genetic origin.21,24,41

The report of syncope, due to autonomic nervous system involvement by
amyloidosis, is a common finding in these patients and their presence in
relation to physical exertion is associated with a worse prognosis, presenting a
high mortality in three months, often due to sudden death.21,41

Ventricular arrhythmias are uncommon causes of syncope in this population. This
is justified by the fact that the myocardium infiltrated by the amyloid material
is more susceptible to episodes of hypoperfusion. Diseases of the conduction
system may be present in the different forms of amyloidosis. However, they are
more frequently found in the form associated with TTR, both senile and
hereditary. Syncope in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is mainly associated
with hypotension due to dysautonomia and bradyarrhythmias and less related to
ventricular arrhythmias. Malignant ventricular arrhythmia, when present, is a
common cause of death in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, and these patients
are strong candidates for implantation of cardio-defibrillators.24

Involvement of the pericardium may occur in some cases, resulting in pericardial
effusion which, most of the time, does not develop cardiac tamponade. Due to the
alterations of cardiac amyloidosis itself, this condition may be masked and not
have echocardiographic signs such as atrial and right ventricular
compression.24,41

The accumulation of the material in the atrium promotes its electromechanical
dysfunction and, consequently, considerably increases the risk of intracavitary
thrombus formation. This process is evident, especially in patients with AL
amyloidosis type and is an independent factor of atrial fibrillation, and when
both factors are present, the risk of thromboembolism is extremely high.
Therefore, the use of anticoagulants should be considered in these
individuals.24,41

A new insight into HFpEF becomes critical, given its increasing relevance as the
most prevalent clinical phenotype of HF in the world population. This data is
present in our country, as evidenced by the DIGITALIS study, which investigated
the prevalence of HF and its phenotypes in primary care in the city of
Niterói. According to this study, among the population with HF, 59% had
the HFpEF phenotype.5

Data from a specialized center in amyloidosis in Brazil point to a high
prevalence of myocardial involvement in patients with amyloid polyneuropathy
from abnormalities on the electrocardiogram (ECG).43

Despite numerous studies about this clinical condition, much is unknown about its
etiophysiopathogeny, which has caused negative results in the studies of
treatment of HFpEF. This is hampered in particular by the numerous phenocopies
that mimic their presentation.6,44

In this scenario, it is worth highlighting the possibility that a portion of the
patients with HFpEF actually present a cardiac amyloidosis. This is confirmed by
recent studies with patients with a diagnosis of HFpEF, in the absence of
arterial hypertension or diabetes, through the new cardio-imaging modalities,
present accumulation of amyloid material in the myocardium. Next to this is the
fact that amyloid material has been identified in necropsy studies of patients
with HF.7,8,15,45

In order to facilitate the identification of a suspected cardiac amyloidosis,
regardless of the type of fibril deposited, we must consider some clinical
evidence and complementary tests as presented in Table 1.7

Clinical criteria and complementary tests in the investigation of cardiac
amyloidosis

HfpEF: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; ECHO: doppler
echocardiography; ECG: electrocardiogram.

In this scenario where the most common etiologies applicable to the HFpEF are not
confirmed, a cardiac amyloidosis scenario should be suspected. Therefore, we
propose a guideline flow chart for the management of these patients (FIGURES 2 and 3).18,22

Cardiac amyloidosis presents an indolent course and the diagnosis is made, often
late, thus contributing to a worse prognosis. In several situations, cardiac
involvement causes great morbidity to the patient, although the diagnosis is
often not suspected, even in conditions where there is the characterization of
restrictive cardiopathy.7

In clinical history, cardiac amyloidosis may be suspected in patients 50 years of
age or older who have signs and symptoms of HF, with an ejection fraction of the
left ventricle greater than or equal to 50% and that do not show improvement of
the symptoms with the treatment. Extracardiac manifestations in the patient's
history should be considered as guiding principles for the diagnosis of HF by
amyloidosis, such as peripheral neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome,
especially recurrent and bilateral. Signs and symptoms such as orthostatic
hypotension, macroglossia, muscular consumption of the tenar and hypothenar
region, haematomas of unknown origin and cardiac electrical conduction
disturbances may also be present.7,29

The ECG is an easily accessible examination that may offer changes that raise the
suspicion of amyloidosis in the presence of a CHF. The finding of a low voltage
QRS complex, electrical axis deviations and branch block can be found.
Arrhythmias are frequent, especially atrial fibrillation, which is related to
amyloid infiltration of the atrium, and complex ventricular
arrhythmias.14,22

ECHO is an important method of diagnostic investigation and the presence of
significant left ventricular hypertrophy associated with ECG with low-voltage
QRS may lead to suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. Another criterion for
suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis is thickening of the left ventricular wall
above 12 mm in the absence of a history of systemic arterial hypertension. Other
findings that may be present in ECHO are the biatrial increase with normal-sized
ventricles, pericardial effusion, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction due to
the pattern of restive cardiomyopathy.9,14,22

Measurement of the thickness of the interventricular septum may suggest the type
of amyloidosis present in the patient, and is often greater in cases of
amyloidosis by TTR than the AL form, and may in many cases be greater than 20
mm. However, the separation between these two forms on a clinical basis is not
always possible.9,14,22

In some patients with cardiac amyloidosis, we can observe the clinical phenotype
similar to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the presence of the
dynamic pressure gradient that is related to an additional "narrowing" of the
left ventricular outflow tract. More recently, longitudinal systolic strain has
been used for the diagnosis of systolic dysfunction in patients with cardiac
amyloidosis, and may show the preservation of the heart tip in relation to other
walls. In the presence of ECG and ECHO alterations we should resort to
complementary tests. In a first step in the elucidation of a case of cardiac
amyloidosis, we investigated the renal function status of this patient through
the nitrogenous excoriations and, in particular, the quantification of protein
loss and its type, made through the collection of 24h urine with dosage
proteinuria and urinary protein electrophoresis. This stage in the investigation
allows the identification of the primary form of amyloidosis and consists in the
identification of the light chains that are in high titers in these patients.
Immunofixation, when associated, allows an increase in the diagnostic accuracy
of this type of presentation.9,14,22,31,34

The abdominal fat aspirate for histopathological study is a more accessible
alternative, since it is a simple diagnostic procedure, easy to perform, safe
and that presents good sensitivity, but having less accuracy in the form
associated with TTR. However, when a negative result is obtained with abdominal
fat aspirate, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy may be essential for the
diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Through this method, the amyloid protein is
stained by congo-red. Other tissues can also be evaluated as the rectum, gums,
bone marrow, kidney, among others. The histochemical study of tissue samples is
important in order to distinguish between the hereditary, senile, systemic and
primary forms, due to differences in treatment and prognosis.14,22,29

Magnetic resonance imaging appears as another alternative for the diagnosis of
cardiac amyloidosis, with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 96% for the
form associated with TTR. Through this examination, it is possible to identify
the myocardial and atrial septal thickening, signs of diastolic dysfunction, and
the typical pattern of late subendocardial enhancement in the left ventricle,
which may also affect all cardiac chambers.11,12,22,29

Molecular imaging has also revolutionized diagnosis. The non-invasive method can
be used from the use of the Tc99m radiotracer, which binds to TTR but not to the
light chain derivatives, being an effective method of evaluating the mutant or
wild forms of cardiac amyloidosis associated with TTR. Positron emission
tomography in conjunction with the C-RiB plotter may be a new strategy to be
used in the diagnosis of these patients.14,22

Bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry analysis
is critical in patients in whom the type of AL-amyloidosis has been identified.
This will demonstrate a clonal population of plasma cells, which are producing
defective light chains of the antibody. If these tests are negative, we should
investigate the hereditary forms of the disease.29,33

There are new studies involving omic sciences that aim to increase the diagnostic
accuracy of amyloidosis. Proteomics involves the study of all the protein
expression of a cell in different conditions, being its study complementary to
the genome, identifying any protein, with or without genetic mutations. The main
technique employed is laser microdissection followed by mass spectrometry
(LMD-MS), through which positive samples in the congo-red color are dissected
and decomposed into smaller components called peptides.25,28

Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis is best performed in specialized centers of the
disease. Treatment requires two approaches: control of heart-related
complications due to amyloid deposition and treatment of the underlying disease
to prevent new amyloid formations.

Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis aims to improve the signs and symptoms of HF.
The use of low-dose diuretics improves symptoms related to congestion, while the
use of the combination of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors has its undefined benefit in amyloidosis.16,18,21,22,24

The use of digitalis has no benefits in this group of patients, since the
myocardium in dysfunction by the amyloid material is more susceptible to toxic
effects, which predisposes to the occurrence of arrhythmias.16,18,21,22,24

The use of anticoagulants should be considered in case of atrial fibrillation and
in the detection of intracavitary thrombi.18,21,22,41

Overall survival is approximately four years after diagnosis and has improved
over the past three decades. AL-amyloidosis is often the result of a clonal
increase of plasma cells in the bone marrow and thus therapy with cytotoxic
chemotherapeutics may be effective. The performance of the hematologist in the
staging process and definition of the therapeutic strategy in this scenario is
fundamental.21,31,33,34

Patients who present a hematological response to treatment have symptomatic
improvement and cardiac biomarkers, and can occur along with amyloid deposition,
which is already evident in the first three months, confirming a better
prognosis in these cases.19,21,31,33,34

Dexamethasone-associated melphalan therapy (MelDex) in patients ineligible for
autologous stem cell transplantation had a response rate around 70%, which was
worse in cases with advanced cardiac involvement. In a recent randomized
clinical trial comparing MelDex with high doses of melphalan followed by stem
cell transplantation showed a better survival rate in patients who took
MelDex.32,46-48

Bortezomib has been shown to be an effective drug when combined with
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, with a significant hematological response
(71%) after two months of use. According to Mayo Clinic group, in the case of
three patients initially ineligible for stem cell therapy, the use of bortezomib
made the procedure possible. Stem cell transplantation is used in 25% of
patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Following the procedure episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia may occur, with mortality of 11% in these
individuals. The positive hematological response in patients submitted to stem
cell therapy is approximately 56%.16,19,27,32,33

A study evaluating the use of bortezomid, dexamethasone and alkylating agents
(BDEX + AA) in 106 patients with symptomatic HF due to AL cardiac amyloidosis
showed an improvement in survival after adjustment of clinical variables. (Hr:
0.209, 95% CI: 0.069 to 0.636, p = 0.006).32,49

Tafamidis appears as an important option for the treatment of amyloidosis, acting
as a kinetic stabilizer of the TTR tetramer. The interaction of molecules at
certain TTR binding sites promotes stability to the protein in its tetrameric
state, markedly decreasing its dissociation and, consequently, the
amyloidogenesis. Tafamidis has the ability to selectively bind to one of the
thyroxine sites in the TTR, promoting the kinetic stabilization of the
tetramer.7,22,24,32,50-54

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the safety
and efficacy of oral Tafamidis in patients with amyloidosis and involvement of
the peripheral nervous system were demonstrated. Clinical trials show that this
medication slows the progression of the disease, improves the function of small
and large caliber nerve fibers and, consequently, reduces the functional loss of
the affected systems, optimizing the quality of life of the patient. In another
study, Tafamidis resulted in stabilization of transthyretin in 97% of patients
with mild to moderate HF due to the wild type of cardiac amyloidosis.7,22,24,32,50-54

Another drug in the evaluation process for the cardiac amyloidosis associated
with TTR is Diflunisal, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory that can stabilize the
tetramer, avoiding amyloidogenesis. One cohort evaluated the tolerance and
effects promoted in 13 patients with cardiac amyloidosis by TTR, both mutant and
wild type. No significant changes in cardiac structure and function were
observed, as well as biomarkers.32,55,56

The use of doxycycline and tauroursodeoxycholic acid was carried out with a small
number of patients, and a possible clinical improvement was identified. A new
second-generation antisense therapy, ISIS-TTRrx, works by reducing the serum
level of the TTR protein by suppressing the gene expression of its synthesis. In
addition, a total of 28 studies are enrolled in the Clinical Trials database for
interventions in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.32,57,58

An alternative treatment for some types of amyloidosis would be liver
transplantation with the goal of replacing the mutated TTR gene that produces
the majority of the circulating transthyretin by a gene found in a genetically
normal donor organ. In this way, liver transplantation may be an alternative to
slow the progression of the disease and prolong the patient's survival. However,
chronic immunosuppression pertinent to transplantation leads to a high mortality
rate in the first year, about 10%, and high morbidity. Transplantation does not
prevent the extrahepatic synthesis of amyloid protein and thus does not delay
the progression of the disease.22,24,32

### Clinical presentations

Amyloidosis cardiomyopathy is classically described as a directt HF model, often
occuring together with ascites, predating lower limb edema and allying with
hepatomegaly on physical examination. Unlike cardiac dysfunction with increased
filling pressures, pulmonary edema is an infrequent condition in amyloidosis
cardiomyopathy.7,8,10,14

A rarer phenotype is the involvement of the interventricular septum with deposit
of the amyloid material promoting the disproportionate thickening of the region,
mimicking a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This presentation constitutes what is
called a phenocopia, that is, a clinical condition that presents itself through
manifestations typical of a disease of well-defined genetic origin.21,24,41

The report of syncope, due to autonomic nervous system involvement by
amyloidosis, is a common finding in these patients and their presence in
relation to physical exertion is associated with a worse prognosis, presenting a
high mortality in three months, often due to sudden death.21,41

Ventricular arrhythmias are uncommon causes of syncope in this population. This
is justified by the fact that the myocardium infiltrated by the amyloid material
is more susceptible to episodes of hypoperfusion. Diseases of the conduction
system may be present in the different forms of amyloidosis. However, they are
more frequently found in the form associated with TTR, both senile and
hereditary. Syncope in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is mainly associated
with hypotension due to dysautonomia and bradyarrhythmias and less related to
ventricular arrhythmias. Malignant ventricular arrhythmia, when present, is a
common cause of death in patients with cardiac amyloidosis, and these patients
are strong candidates for implantation of cardio-defibrillators.24

Involvement of the pericardium may occur in some cases, resulting in pericardial
effusion which, most of the time, does not develop cardiac tamponade. Due to the
alterations of cardiac amyloidosis itself, this condition may be masked and not
have echocardiographic signs such as atrial and right ventricular
compression.24,41

The accumulation of the material in the atrium promotes its electromechanical
dysfunction and, consequently, considerably increases the risk of intracavitary
thrombus formation. This process is evident, especially in patients with AL
amyloidosis type and is an independent factor of atrial fibrillation, and when
both factors are present, the risk of thromboembolism is extremely high.
Therefore, the use of anticoagulants should be considered in these
individuals.24,41

### Cardiac amyloidosis and its new clinical phenotype

A new insight into HFpEF becomes critical, given its increasing relevance as the
most prevalent clinical phenotype of HF in the world population. This data is
present in our country, as evidenced by the DIGITALIS study, which investigated
the prevalence of HF and its phenotypes in primary care in the city of
Niterói. According to this study, among the population with HF, 59% had
the HFpEF phenotype.5

Data from a specialized center in amyloidosis in Brazil point to a high
prevalence of myocardial involvement in patients with amyloid polyneuropathy
from abnormalities on the electrocardiogram (ECG).43

Despite numerous studies about this clinical condition, much is unknown about its
etiophysiopathogeny, which has caused negative results in the studies of
treatment of HFpEF. This is hampered in particular by the numerous phenocopies
that mimic their presentation.6,44

In this scenario, it is worth highlighting the possibility that a portion of the
patients with HFpEF actually present a cardiac amyloidosis. This is confirmed by
recent studies with patients with a diagnosis of HFpEF, in the absence of
arterial hypertension or diabetes, through the new cardio-imaging modalities,
present accumulation of amyloid material in the myocardium. Next to this is the
fact that amyloid material has been identified in necropsy studies of patients
with HF.7,8,15,45

In order to facilitate the identification of a suspected cardiac amyloidosis,
regardless of the type of fibril deposited, we must consider some clinical
evidence and complementary tests as presented in Table 1.7

Clinical criteria and complementary tests in the investigation of cardiac
amyloidosis

HfpEF: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; ECHO: doppler
echocardiography; ECG: electrocardiogram.

In this scenario where the most common etiologies applicable to the HFpEF are not
confirmed, a cardiac amyloidosis scenario should be suspected. Therefore, we
propose a guideline flow chart for the management of these patients (FIGURES 2 and 3).18,22

### Diagnostic approach

Cardiac amyloidosis presents an indolent course and the diagnosis is made, often
late, thus contributing to a worse prognosis. In several situations, cardiac
involvement causes great morbidity to the patient, although the diagnosis is
often not suspected, even in conditions where there is the characterization of
restrictive cardiopathy.7

In clinical history, cardiac amyloidosis may be suspected in patients 50 years of
age or older who have signs and symptoms of HF, with an ejection fraction of the
left ventricle greater than or equal to 50% and that do not show improvement of
the symptoms with the treatment. Extracardiac manifestations in the patient's
history should be considered as guiding principles for the diagnosis of HF by
amyloidosis, such as peripheral neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome,
especially recurrent and bilateral. Signs and symptoms such as orthostatic
hypotension, macroglossia, muscular consumption of the tenar and hypothenar
region, haematomas of unknown origin and cardiac electrical conduction
disturbances may also be present.7,29

The ECG is an easily accessible examination that may offer changes that raise the
suspicion of amyloidosis in the presence of a CHF. The finding of a low voltage
QRS complex, electrical axis deviations and branch block can be found.
Arrhythmias are frequent, especially atrial fibrillation, which is related to
amyloid infiltration of the atrium, and complex ventricular
arrhythmias.14,22

ECHO is an important method of diagnostic investigation and the presence of
significant left ventricular hypertrophy associated with ECG with low-voltage
QRS may lead to suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis. Another criterion for
suspicion of cardiac amyloidosis is thickening of the left ventricular wall
above 12 mm in the absence of a history of systemic arterial hypertension. Other
findings that may be present in ECHO are the biatrial increase with normal-sized
ventricles, pericardial effusion, and evidence of diastolic dysfunction due to
the pattern of restive cardiomyopathy.9,14,22

Measurement of the thickness of the interventricular septum may suggest the type
of amyloidosis present in the patient, and is often greater in cases of
amyloidosis by TTR than the AL form, and may in many cases be greater than 20
mm. However, the separation between these two forms on a clinical basis is not
always possible.9,14,22

In some patients with cardiac amyloidosis, we can observe the clinical phenotype
similar to obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to the presence of the
dynamic pressure gradient that is related to an additional "narrowing" of the
left ventricular outflow tract. More recently, longitudinal systolic strain has
been used for the diagnosis of systolic dysfunction in patients with cardiac
amyloidosis, and may show the preservation of the heart tip in relation to other
walls. In the presence of ECG and ECHO alterations we should resort to
complementary tests. In a first step in the elucidation of a case of cardiac
amyloidosis, we investigated the renal function status of this patient through
the nitrogenous excoriations and, in particular, the quantification of protein
loss and its type, made through the collection of 24h urine with dosage
proteinuria and urinary protein electrophoresis. This stage in the investigation
allows the identification of the primary form of amyloidosis and consists in the
identification of the light chains that are in high titers in these patients.
Immunofixation, when associated, allows an increase in the diagnostic accuracy
of this type of presentation.9,14,22,31,34

The abdominal fat aspirate for histopathological study is a more accessible
alternative, since it is a simple diagnostic procedure, easy to perform, safe
and that presents good sensitivity, but having less accuracy in the form
associated with TTR. However, when a negative result is obtained with abdominal
fat aspirate, right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy may be essential for the
diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Through this method, the amyloid protein is
stained by congo-red. Other tissues can also be evaluated as the rectum, gums,
bone marrow, kidney, among others. The histochemical study of tissue samples is
important in order to distinguish between the hereditary, senile, systemic and
primary forms, due to differences in treatment and prognosis.14,22,29

Magnetic resonance imaging appears as another alternative for the diagnosis of
cardiac amyloidosis, with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 96% for the
form associated with TTR. Through this examination, it is possible to identify
the myocardial and atrial septal thickening, signs of diastolic dysfunction, and
the typical pattern of late subendocardial enhancement in the left ventricle,
which may also affect all cardiac chambers.11,12,22,29

Molecular imaging has also revolutionized diagnosis. The non-invasive method can
be used from the use of the Tc99m radiotracer, which binds to TTR but not to the
light chain derivatives, being an effective method of evaluating the mutant or
wild forms of cardiac amyloidosis associated with TTR. Positron emission
tomography in conjunction with the C-RiB plotter may be a new strategy to be
used in the diagnosis of these patients.14,22

Bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry analysis
is critical in patients in whom the type of AL-amyloidosis has been identified.
This will demonstrate a clonal population of plasma cells, which are producing
defective light chains of the antibody. If these tests are negative, we should
investigate the hereditary forms of the disease.29,33

There are new studies involving omic sciences that aim to increase the diagnostic
accuracy of amyloidosis. Proteomics involves the study of all the protein
expression of a cell in different conditions, being its study complementary to
the genome, identifying any protein, with or without genetic mutations. The main
technique employed is laser microdissection followed by mass spectrometry
(LMD-MS), through which positive samples in the congo-red color are dissected
and decomposed into smaller components called peptides.25,28

### Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis

Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis is best performed in specialized centers of the
disease. Treatment requires two approaches: control of heart-related
complications due to amyloid deposition and treatment of the underlying disease
to prevent new amyloid formations.

Treatment of cardiac amyloidosis aims to improve the signs and symptoms of HF.
The use of low-dose diuretics improves symptoms related to congestion, while the
use of the combination of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors has its undefined benefit in amyloidosis.16,18,21,22,24

The use of digitalis has no benefits in this group of patients, since the
myocardium in dysfunction by the amyloid material is more susceptible to toxic
effects, which predisposes to the occurrence of arrhythmias.16,18,21,22,24

The use of anticoagulants should be considered in case of atrial fibrillation and
in the detection of intracavitary thrombi.18,21,22,41

### Amyloidosis of AL form

Overall survival is approximately four years after diagnosis and has improved
over the past three decades. AL-amyloidosis is often the result of a clonal
increase of plasma cells in the bone marrow and thus therapy with cytotoxic
chemotherapeutics may be effective. The performance of the hematologist in the
staging process and definition of the therapeutic strategy in this scenario is
fundamental.21,31,33,34

Patients who present a hematological response to treatment have symptomatic
improvement and cardiac biomarkers, and can occur along with amyloid deposition,
which is already evident in the first three months, confirming a better
prognosis in these cases.19,21,31,33,34

Dexamethasone-associated melphalan therapy (MelDex) in patients ineligible for
autologous stem cell transplantation had a response rate around 70%, which was
worse in cases with advanced cardiac involvement. In a recent randomized
clinical trial comparing MelDex with high doses of melphalan followed by stem
cell transplantation showed a better survival rate in patients who took
MelDex.32,46-48

Bortezomib has been shown to be an effective drug when combined with
cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, with a significant hematological response
(71%) after two months of use. According to Mayo Clinic group, in the case of
three patients initially ineligible for stem cell therapy, the use of bortezomib
made the procedure possible. Stem cell transplantation is used in 25% of
patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Following the procedure episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia may occur, with mortality of 11% in these
individuals. The positive hematological response in patients submitted to stem
cell therapy is approximately 56%.16,19,27,32,33

A study evaluating the use of bortezomid, dexamethasone and alkylating agents
(BDEX + AA) in 106 patients with symptomatic HF due to AL cardiac amyloidosis
showed an improvement in survival after adjustment of clinical variables. (Hr:
0.209, 95% CI: 0.069 to 0.636, p = 0.006).32,49

### Form associated with TTR

Tafamidis appears as an important option for the treatment of amyloidosis, acting
as a kinetic stabilizer of the TTR tetramer. The interaction of molecules at
certain TTR binding sites promotes stability to the protein in its tetrameric
state, markedly decreasing its dissociation and, consequently, the
amyloidogenesis. Tafamidis has the ability to selectively bind to one of the
thyroxine sites in the TTR, promoting the kinetic stabilization of the
tetramer.7,22,24,32,50-54

In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the safety
and efficacy of oral Tafamidis in patients with amyloidosis and involvement of
the peripheral nervous system were demonstrated. Clinical trials show that this
medication slows the progression of the disease, improves the function of small
and large caliber nerve fibers and, consequently, reduces the functional loss of
the affected systems, optimizing the quality of life of the patient. In another
study, Tafamidis resulted in stabilization of transthyretin in 97% of patients
with mild to moderate HF due to the wild type of cardiac amyloidosis.7,22,24,32,50-54

Another drug in the evaluation process for the cardiac amyloidosis associated
with TTR is Diflunisal, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory that can stabilize the
tetramer, avoiding amyloidogenesis. One cohort evaluated the tolerance and
effects promoted in 13 patients with cardiac amyloidosis by TTR, both mutant and
wild type. No significant changes in cardiac structure and function were
observed, as well as biomarkers.32,55,56

The use of doxycycline and tauroursodeoxycholic acid was carried out with a small
number of patients, and a possible clinical improvement was identified. A new
second-generation antisense therapy, ISIS-TTRrx, works by reducing the serum
level of the TTR protein by suppressing the gene expression of its synthesis. In
addition, a total of 28 studies are enrolled in the Clinical Trials database for
interventions in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.32,57,58

An alternative treatment for some types of amyloidosis would be liver
transplantation with the goal of replacing the mutated TTR gene that produces
the majority of the circulating transthyretin by a gene found in a genetically
normal donor organ. In this way, liver transplantation may be an alternative to
slow the progression of the disease and prolong the patient's survival. However,
chronic immunosuppression pertinent to transplantation leads to a high mortality
rate in the first year, about 10%, and high morbidity. Transplantation does not
prevent the extrahepatic synthesis of amyloid protein and thus does not delay
the progression of the disease.22,24,32

### Conclusion

Cardiac amyloidosis inaugurates a new era of personalized cardiology, where precise
diagnosis through techniques involving molecular genetic analysis, biomarkers and
cardioimaging methods make it possible to classify the form of amyloidosis and
define its clinical course and prognosis and, in the future, guide the therapeutics
of these frames.

The clinical suspicion of amyloidosis should be increased in cases of HFPSE in which
the methods of cardiac imaging are compatible with the restrictive cardiomyopathy or
signs of dissociation between ECHO and ECG findings. The partnership with centers
specialized in amyloidosis combined with new technologies are fundamental in the
management of these patients through specialized treatments, including organ
transplantation, or even involving patients in clinical studies that evaluate the
action of new emerging drugs.
