## Cellular secretion and cytotoxicity of transthyretin mutant proteins underlie late-onset amyloidosis and neurodegeneration

### Abstract

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a progressive life-threatening disease characterized by the deposition of transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils. Several pathogenic variants have been shown to destabilize TTR tetramers, leading to aggregation of misfolded TTR fibrils. However, factors that underlie the differential age of disease onset amongst amyloidogenic TTR variants remain elusive. Here, we examined the biological properties of various TTR mutations and found that the cellular secretory pattern of the wild-type (WT) TTR was similar to those of the late-onset mutant (Ala97Ser, p. Ala117Ser), stable mutant (Thr119Met, p. Thr139Met), early-onset mutant (Val30Met, p. Val50Met), but not in the unstable mutant (Asp18Gly, p. Asp38Gly). Cytotoxicity assays revealed their toxicities in the order of Val30Met > Ala97Ser > WT > Thr119Met in neuroblastoma cells. Surprisingly, while early-onset amyloidogenic TTR monomers (M-TTRs) are retained by the endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC), late-onset amyloidogenic M-TTRs can be secreted extracellularly. Treatment of thapsigargin (Tg) to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) alleviates Ala97Ser M-TTR secretion. Interestingly, Ala97Ser TTR overexpression in Drosophila causes late-onset fast neurodegeneration and a relatively short lifespan, recapitulating human disease progression. Our study demonstrates that the escape of TTR monomers from the ERQC may underlie late-onset amyloidogenesis in patients and suggests that targeting ERQC could mitigate late-onset ATTR.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s00018-019-03357-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
