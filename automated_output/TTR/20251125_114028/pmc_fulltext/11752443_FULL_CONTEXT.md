## The V122I cardiomyopathy variant of transthyretin increases the
 velocity of rate-limiting tetramer dissociation, resulting in
 accelerated amyloidosis

### Abstract

The transthyretin (TTR) amyloid diseases are of keen
 interest, because there are >80 mutations that cause, and a few
 mutations that suppress, disease. The V122I variant is the most common
 amyloidogenic mutation worldwide, producing familial amyloidotic
 cardiomyopathy primarily in individuals of African descent. The
 substitution shifts the tetramer-folded monomer equilibrium toward
 monomer (lowers tetramer stability) and lowers the kinetic barrier
 associated with rate-limiting tetramer dissociation (pH 7; relative to
 wild-type TTR) required for amyloid fibril formation. Fibril formation
 is also accelerated because the folded monomer resulting from the
 tetramer-folded monomer equilibrium rapidly undergoes partial
 denaturation and self-assembles into amyloid (in vitro)
 when subjected to a mild denaturation stress (e.g., pH 4.8).
 Incorporation of the V122I mutation into a folded monomeric variant of
 transthyretin reveals that this mutation does not destabilize the
 tertiary structure or alter the rate of amyloidogenesis relative to the
 wild-type monomer. The increase in the velocity of rate-limiting
 tetramer dissociation coupled with the lowered tetramer stability
 (increasing the mol fraction of folded monomer present at equilibrium)
 may explain why V122I confers an apparent absolute anatomic risk for
 cardiac amyloid deposition.
