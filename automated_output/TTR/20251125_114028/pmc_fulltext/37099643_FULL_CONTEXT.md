## Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic parameters associated with the development of pacing and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indication in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy

### Abstract

AbstractAimsThis study aimed to identify factors for attention leading to future pacing device implantation (PDI) and reveal the necessity of prophylactic PDI or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) patients.Methods and resultsThis retrospective single-center observational study included consecutive 114 wild-type ATTR-CM (ATTRwt-CM) and 50 hereditary ATTR-CM (ATTRv-CM) patients, neither implanted with a pacing device nor fulfilling indications for PDI at diagnosis. As a study outcome, patient backgrounds were compared with and without future PDI, and the incidence of PDI in each conduction disturbance was examined. Furthermore, appropriate ICD therapies were investigated in all 19 patients with ICD implantation. PR-interval ≥220 msec, interventricular septum (IVS) thickness ≥16.9 mm, and bifascicular block were significantly associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients, and brain natriuretic peptide ≥35.7 pg/mL, IVS thickness ≥11.3 mm, and bifascicular block in ATTRv-CM patients. The incidence of subsequent PDI in patients with bifascicular block at diagnosis was significantly higher than that of normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction in both ATTRwt-CM [hazard ratio (HR): 13.70, P = 0.019] and ATTRv-CM (HR: 12.94, P = 0.002), whereas that of patients with first-degree AV block was neither (ATTRwt-CM: HR: 2.14, P = 0.511, ATTRv-CM: HR: 1.57, P = 0.701). Regarding ICD, only 2 of 16 ATTRwt-CM and 1 of 3 ATTRv-CM patients received appropriate anti-tachycardia pacing or shock therapy, under the number of intervals to detect for ventricular tachycardia of 16–32.ConclusionsAccording to our retrospective single-center observational study, prophylactic PDI did not require first-degree AV block in both ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, and prophylactic ICD implantation was also controversial in both ATTR-CM. Larger prospective, multi-center studies are necessary to confirm these results.

### Introduction

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a secondary cardiomyopathy caused by destabilization of the transthyretin (TTR) tetramer resulting in the formation of amyloid fibrils, which are deposited in the myocardial extracellular matrix.1 Depending on the presence/absence of genetic mutations, ATTR-CM is classified as hereditary ATTR-CM (ATTRv-CM; v for variant) and wild-type ATTR-CM (ATTRwt-CM).2 Progressive amyloid deposition into the myocardial interstitium causes restrictive cardiomyopathy and diastolic heart failure, but into the conduction system leads to bradyarrhythmia and atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmia, resulting in permanent pacing device implantation (PDI) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.3,4,5 However, factors associated with PDI and the effectiveness of prophylactic PDI in ATTR-CM patients are yet unclear. Furthermore, there are varying reports on the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in cardiac amyloidosis patients,6–10 but the effectiveness of ICD implantation in ATTR-CM patients has not been adequately evaluated.

The purpose of this study was to reveal factors requiring attention that may lead to future PDI in ATTR-CM patients, and clarify the necessity of prophylactic PDI or ICD implantation in ATTR-CM patients.

### Methods

This was a retrospective observational study of 212 consecutive patients diagnosed with ATTRwt-CM (n = 148, between January 2002 and April 2020) or ATTRv-CM (n = 64, between January 1999 and December 2018) at Kumamoto University Hospital. Patients without electrocardiography (ECG) and/or echocardiography data in our hospital at diagnosis and patients who had already been implanted cardiac electronic pacing device at diagnosis were excluded. Furthermore, patients who had not yet implanted the pacing device but had already met the indications for PDI at diagnosis were also excluded. In addition, two ATTRv-CM patients who did not satisfy the indications for PDI but underwent prophylactic PDI were also excluded. Therefore, 114 patients with ATTRwt-CM and 50 patients with ATTRv-CM were analysed in our study (Figure 1A and B).

Study flow chart. Panel A shows the study flow chart of patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM). Panel B shows the study flow chart of patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM). AF, atrial fibrillation; CRTD, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator; ECG, electrocardiography; ICD, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; PDI, pacing device implantation; PM, pacemaker.

Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of the presence of atrioventricular (AV) block at diagnosis on PDI, ATTRwt-CM, and ATTRv-CM patients were divided into two groups by the presence or absence of permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), respectively, because it is difficult to measure PR-interval or completely distinguish between second-degree AV block, first-degree AV block, and normal AV conduction during AF rhythm, except for third-degree AV block. In ATTRwt-CM patients, there were 82 patients without permanent AF (non-permanent AF group) and 32 patients with permanent AF (permanent AF group), while there were no patients with permanent AF in ATTRv-CM (Figure 1A and B, see Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

The number of patients with and without PDI due to conduction disturbances and the type of implanted device is shown in Figure 1 and see Supplementary material online, Figure S1.

The incidence of appropriate ICD therapy was investigated in all patients with implantable devices with defibrillators in this study.

This study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Kumamoto University (No. 1590). The requirement for informed consent was exempted because the risk of this retrospective study was low and direct consent could not be obtained from all subjects. Therefore, we widely advertised the study protocol at Kumamoto University Hospital and on our website (http://www.kumadai-junnai.com), giving patients the opportunity to opt out of the study.

ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM were diagnosed as described in Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix.

The definition of conduction disturbances such as sinus and AV node dysfunction and fascicular block complied with Braunwald’s Heart Disease,11 Rubenstein’s Classification of the sick sinus syndrome (SSS),12 and ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy of Cardiac Rhythm Abnormalities,13 as described in the Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix. Especially, bifascicular block was defined as (1) right bundle branch block (RBBB) with a left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), (2) RBBB with a left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), and (3) left bundle branch block (LBBB) alone (both LAFB and LPFB).

Pacemaker implantation was performed for sinus node dysfunction, symptomatic Wenckebach second-degree AV block, Mobitz second-degree AV block, AF with bradycardia, bifascicular/trifascicular block, and third-degree AV block that satisfied the indications in the Japanese Circulation Society Guidelines for Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiologic Studies published in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2019,14 as listed in Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix, based on the ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Implantation of Cardiac Pacemakers and Antiarrhythmia Devices published in 1984, 1991, 1998, 2002, and 2008,13 and ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy published in 2007 and 2013.15 In cases whose indications for pacing devices in bifascicular/trifascicular block or AV block were questionable, electrophysiological studies were sometimes performed to evaluate the indications, as described in the ESC guidelines.5 In addition, ICD implantation was also performed according to the ACCF/HRS/AHA/ASE/HFSA/SCAI/SCCT/SCMR 2013 Appropriate Use Criteria for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy16 for primary prevention or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. This criterion indicates that ICD implantation may be considered in heart failure patients with a diagnosis of amyloidosis, regardless of ejection fraction (EF). Therefore, ICD implantation has been considered and performed chiefly in patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia often documented. Furthermore, this criterion also indicates that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is appropriate for patients with EF ≤35% and may be appropriate for patients with EF >35% in whom right ventricular pacing is anticipated exceeds 40% after implantation.16 Therefore, CRT implantation was considered and performed in a patient with low EF in whom right ventricular pacing was anticipated exceeding 40% after implantation. If only pacemaker (PM) indication was fulfilled, PM implantation was performed, and if only the ICD indication was fulfilled, ICD implantation was performed. If the ICD indication was also satisfied when the PM indication was fulfilled, ICD implantation was performed as a pacing device. Only six ATTRwt-CM patients who met both PM and ICD indication with low EF underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRTD) implantation.

History of AF means a history of all types of AF, including paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, and permanent AF. Low voltage was defined as a QRS amplitude of 0.5 mV or less for limb lead or 1.0 mV or less for precordial lead.

The study outcomes were the parameters associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, the incidence of PDI after diagnosis of ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM according to the conduction disturbances, and the incidence of appropriate device therapy in subgroups with ICD implantation.

The distribution of continuous data was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables with normal distributions are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and non-normally distributed variables as median values with interquartile range (IQR). Continuous variables were compared using the Student’s t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann–Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages and were compared using the χ2 test. To identify significant parameters related to PDI, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed using parameters that were significant in univariate Cox regression analysis, respectively, and leaving clinically significant factors for those with internal correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value of significant parameters for PDI. The mortality and the incidence of PDI and appropriate ICD therapy were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis using the log-rank statistic and Cox regression analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

### Study design and study population

This was a retrospective observational study of 212 consecutive patients diagnosed with ATTRwt-CM (n = 148, between January 2002 and April 2020) or ATTRv-CM (n = 64, between January 1999 and December 2018) at Kumamoto University Hospital. Patients without electrocardiography (ECG) and/or echocardiography data in our hospital at diagnosis and patients who had already been implanted cardiac electronic pacing device at diagnosis were excluded. Furthermore, patients who had not yet implanted the pacing device but had already met the indications for PDI at diagnosis were also excluded. In addition, two ATTRv-CM patients who did not satisfy the indications for PDI but underwent prophylactic PDI were also excluded. Therefore, 114 patients with ATTRwt-CM and 50 patients with ATTRv-CM were analysed in our study (Figure 1A and B).

In ATTRwt-CM patients, there were 82 patients without permanent AF (non-permanent AF group) and 32 patients with permanent AF (permanent AF group), while there were no patients with permanent AF in ATTRv-CM (Figure 1A and B, see Supplementary material online, Figure S1).

The number of patients with and without PDI due to conduction disturbances and the type of implanted device is shown in Figure 1 and see Supplementary material online, Figure S1.

The incidence of appropriate ICD therapy was investigated in all patients with implantable devices with defibrillators in this study.

This study was conducted according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Kumamoto University (No. 1590).

### Diagnosis of wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy and hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy

ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM were diagnosed as described in Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix.

### Definition of conduction disturbances

The definition of conduction disturbances such as sinus and AV node dysfunction and fascicular block complied with Braunwald’s Heart Disease,11 Rubenstein’s Classification of the sick sinus syndrome (SSS),12 and ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy of Cardiac Rhythm Abnormalities,13 as described in the Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix. Especially, bifascicular block was defined as (1) right bundle branch block (RBBB) with a left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), (2) RBBB with a left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), and (3) left bundle branch block (LBBB) alone (both LAFB and LPFB).

### Indication of device implantation

Pacemaker implantation was performed for sinus node dysfunction, symptomatic Wenckebach second-degree AV block, Mobitz second-degree AV block, AF with bradycardia, bifascicular/trifascicular block, and third-degree AV block that satisfied the indications in the Japanese Circulation Society Guidelines for Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiologic Studies published in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2019,14 as listed in Supplementary material online, supplemental appendix, based on the ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Implantation of Cardiac Pacemakers and Antiarrhythmia Devices published in 1984, 1991, 1998, 2002, and 2008,13 and ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy published in 2007 and 2013.15 In cases whose indications for pacing devices in bifascicular/trifascicular block or AV block were questionable, electrophysiological studies were sometimes performed to evaluate the indications, as described in the ESC guidelines.5 In addition, ICD implantation was also performed according to the ACCF/HRS/AHA/ASE/HFSA/SCAI/SCCT/SCMR 2013 Appropriate Use Criteria for Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy16 for primary prevention or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. This criterion indicates that ICD implantation may be considered in heart failure patients with a diagnosis of amyloidosis, regardless of ejection fraction (EF). Therefore, ICD implantation has been considered and performed chiefly in patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia often documented. Furthermore, this criterion also indicates that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is appropriate for patients with EF ≤35% and may be appropriate for patients with EF >35% in whom right ventricular pacing is anticipated exceeds 40% after implantation.16 Therefore, CRT implantation was considered and performed in a patient with low EF in whom right ventricular pacing was anticipated exceeding 40% after implantation. If only pacemaker (PM) indication was fulfilled, PM implantation was performed, and if only the ICD indication was fulfilled, ICD implantation was performed. If the ICD indication was also satisfied when the PM indication was fulfilled, ICD implantation was performed as a pacing device. Only six ATTRwt-CM patients who met both PM and ICD indication with low EF underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRTD) implantation.

### Other definition of variables

History of AF means a history of all types of AF, including paroxysmal AF, persistent AF, and permanent AF. Low voltage was defined as a QRS amplitude of 0.5 mV or less for limb lead or 1.0 mV or less for precordial lead.

### Study outcomes

The study outcomes were the parameters associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, the incidence of PDI after diagnosis of ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM according to the conduction disturbances, and the incidence of appropriate device therapy in subgroups with ICD implantation.

### Statistical analysis

The distribution of continuous data was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables with normal distributions are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and non-normally distributed variables as median values with interquartile range (IQR). Continuous variables were compared using the Student’s t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann–Whitney U-test for non-normally distributed variables. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages and were compared using the χ2 test. To identify significant parameters related to PDI, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed using parameters that were significant in univariate Cox regression analysis, respectively, and leaving clinically significant factors for those with internal correlation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value of significant parameters for PDI. The mortality and the incidence of PDI and appropriate ICD therapy were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis using the log-rank statistic and Cox regression analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

### Results

There were significant differences in many baseline characteristics between ATTRwt-CM (n = 114) and ATTRv-CM (n = 50) patients, as follows (Table 1): ATTRwt-CM vs. ATTRv-CM patients: age: 77.9 ± 6.7 years vs. 44.1 ± 14.6 years, P < 0.001; the proportion of men: 83.3% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.001. The prevalence of comorbidities was significantly higher and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly lower in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients. Regarding cardiac parameters, interventricular septum (IVS) thickness, left ventricular posterior wall (PW) thickness, left atrial diameter, E/e′ ratio, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were significantly higher in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients. Regarding ECG data, the PR-interval was longer and the proportion of RBBB and permanent AF was higher in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients (Table 1). The mortality of 114 ATTRwt-CM patients and 50 ATTRv-CM patients was also quite different, and the proportion free of all-cause death and cardiac death was significantly lower in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients, respectively (Figure 2A and B, and see Supplementary material online, Figure S2). The number of hospitalizations for cardiac causes was significantly higher in ATTRwt-CM than in ATTRv-CM (52.6% vs. 34.0%, P = 0.028) (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). On the other hand, because of the low frequency of sudden deaths from a probable arrhythmic cause (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2A and B), there was no significant difference in proportion free of arrhythmic death between ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients (Figure 2C), and the number of hospitalization due to rhythm and/or conduction disturbances was not also a difference between patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM (16.7% vs. 30.0%, P = 0.053) (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). Since patients who already met the indications for PDI at diagnosis were excluded, ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients with third-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, and SSS at diagnosis were not included in this study (Table 1). Proportion free of PDI in 114 ATTRwt-CM patients and 50 ATTRv-CM patients were not significant differences (Figure 2D).

Morbidity and mortality in this study. Proportion free of all-cause death (panel A), cardiac death (panel B), and arrhythmic death in patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM) and hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) were shown. Proportion free of pacing device implantation (PDI) in patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM were shown in panel D.

Baseline characteristics at the time of diagnosis in patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, median value with interquartile range [IQR], or frequencies and percentages (%).

AF = atrial fibrillation; ATTRv-CM = hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy; ATTRwt-CM = wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy; AV = atrioventricular; IAVB = first-degree atrioventricular block; IIAVB = second-degree atrioventricular block; IIIAVB = third-degree atrioventricular block; BNP = brain natriuretic peptide; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration ratio; hs-cTnT = high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T; IVS = interventricular septum; LAD = left axis deviation; LVDd = left ventricular end-diastolic diameter; LVDs = left ventricular end-systolic diameter; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; NAD = normal axis deviation; PW = posterior left ventricular wall; RAD = right axis deviation; RBBB = right bundle branch block; SSS = sick sinus syndrome.

In ATTRwt-CM patients (n = 114), 15 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 9, ICD: 1, CRTD: 5) (Figure 1A). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis for clinical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic findings, respectively, showed that IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients [IVS thickness: hazard ratio (HR): 1.394, P < 0.001; bifascicular block: HR: 5.031, P = 0.002) (Table 2). ROC curve analysis revealed that IVS thickness ≥16.9 mm [sensitivity: 0.733, specificity: 0.778, area under the curve (AUC): 0.809, P < 0.001] were independent predictors of future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3A).

Meanwhile, focusing on ATTRwt-CM patients with non-permanent AF (n = 82), 12 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 7, ICD: 1, CRTD: 4) (Figure 1A and see Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that in addition to IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters, PR-interval were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients (IVS thickness: HR: 1.358, P = 0.001; PR-interval: HR: 1.013, P = 0.043; bifascicular block: HR: 5.641, P = 0.004, the correlation coefficient between PR-interval and bifascicular block: 0.135) (Table 3). ROC curve analysis revealed that PR-interval ≥220 msec were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients with non-permanent AF (sensitivity: 0.750, specificity: 0.671, AUC: 0.704, P = 0.026) (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3B).

In ATTRv-CM patients (n = 50), 14 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 13, ICD: 1, CRTD: 0) (Figure 1B). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the levels of BNP in clinical parameters, IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients (BNP: HR: 1.010, P = 0.010; IVS thickness: HR: 1.284, P < 0.001; bifascicular block: HR: 11.537, P = 0.001) (Table 4). ROC curve analysis revealed that BNP ≥35.7 pg/mL [sensitivity: 0.917, specificity: 0.606, area under the curve (AUC): 0.785, P < 0.001] and IVS thickness ≥11.3 mm (sensitivity: 0.643, specificity: 0.600, AUC: 0.637, P = 0.153) were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3C and D).

Meanwhile, focusing on ATTRv-CM patients with Val30Met (valine to methionine substitution at position 30) mutation (n = 36), 11 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 9, ICD: 2, CRTD: 0). The levels of BNP in clinical parameters, IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients as well (BNP: HR: 1.018, P = 0.006; IVS thickness: HR: 1.303, P = 0.003; bifascicular block: HR: 6.310, P = 0.044) (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).

However, to clarify whether first-degree AV block alone is really associated with PDI in ATTRwt-CM and whether first-degree AV block is really not associated with PDI in ATTRv-CM, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the incidence of PDI between normal AV conduction, first-degree AV block, and bifascicular block in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, respectively (Figure 3). The incidence of PDI in patients with normal AV conduction and first-degree AV block alone at diagnosis increased gradually in both the ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients (Figure 3A and B). However, the incidence of PDI in patients with bifascicular block at diagnosis was significantly higher compared with normal AV conduction or first-degree AV block alone in both ATTRwt-CM patients and ATTRv-CM patients (ATTRwt-CM: log-rank P = 0.012, ATTRv-CM: log-rank P < 0.001) (Figure 3A and B). After adjustment for variables with significant differences (see Supplementary material online, Table S3), bifascicular block was significantly more likely to result in future PDI compared to normal AV conduction (adjusted HR: 13.70, P = 0.019), but first-degree AV block alone was not (adjusted HR: 2.14, P = 0.511) (see Supplementary material online, Table S3and Figure 3A). Similarly, after adjustment for variables with significant differences (see Supplementary material online, Table S3), bifascicular block was significantly more likely to lead to future PDI compared to normal AV conduction (adjusted HR: 12.94, P = 0.002), but first-degree AV block alone was not (adjusted HR: 1.57, P = 0.701) (see Supplementary material online, Table S3and Figure 3B).

Incidence of pacing device implantation in each conduction disturbance at diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the comparison of pacing device implantation (PDI) between normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction, first-degree AV block (IABV) alone, and bifascicular block at the time of diagnosis are shown in patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM) (panel A) and hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) (panel B). HR, hazard ratio.

Among patients with ATTRwt-CM, 10 patients underwent ICD implantation and 6 patients underwent CRTD implantation for the primary prevention (n = 14) or secondary prevention (n = 2) of sudden cardiac death (Table 5). In contrast, three patients with ATTRv-CM underwent ICD implantation for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Under the number of intervals to detect ventricular tachycardia (VT) of 16–32, anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) was delivered only in one VT patient with ATTRwt-CM and one VT patient with ATTRv-CM, and subsequently, shock therapy was administered only in one VT patient with ATTRwt-CM, all occurring within 2 years after ICD implantation. (Table 5, see Supplementary material online, Table S4, and Figure 4).

### Baseline clinical characteristics in this study

There were significant differences in many baseline characteristics between ATTRwt-CM (n = 114) and ATTRv-CM (n = 50) patients, as follows (Table 1): ATTRwt-CM vs. ATTRv-CM patients: age: 77.9 ± 6.7 years vs. 44.1 ± 14.6 years, P < 0.001; the proportion of men: 83.3% vs. 60.0%, P = 0.001. The prevalence of comorbidities was significantly higher and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly lower in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients. Regarding cardiac parameters, interventricular septum (IVS) thickness, left ventricular posterior wall (PW) thickness, left atrial diameter, E/e′ ratio, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were significantly higher in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients. Regarding ECG data, the PR-interval was longer and the proportion of RBBB and permanent AF was higher in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients (Table 1). The mortality of 114 ATTRwt-CM patients and 50 ATTRv-CM patients was also quite different, and the proportion free of all-cause death and cardiac death was significantly lower in ATTRwt-CM patients than in ATTRv-CM patients, respectively (Figure 2A and B, and see Supplementary material online, Figure S2). The number of hospitalizations for cardiac causes was significantly higher in ATTRwt-CM than in ATTRv-CM (52.6% vs. 34.0%, P = 0.028) (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). On the other hand, because of the low frequency of sudden deaths from a probable arrhythmic cause (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2A and B), there was no significant difference in proportion free of arrhythmic death between ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients (Figure 2C), and the number of hospitalization due to rhythm and/or conduction disturbances was not also a difference between patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM (16.7% vs. 30.0%, P = 0.053) (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). Since patients who already met the indications for PDI at diagnosis were excluded, ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients with third-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, and SSS at diagnosis were not included in this study (Table 1). Proportion free of PDI in 114 ATTRwt-CM patients and 50 ATTRv-CM patients were not significant differences (Figure 2D).

Morbidity and mortality in this study. Proportion free of all-cause death (panel A), cardiac death (panel B), and arrhythmic death in patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM) and hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) were shown. Proportion free of pacing device implantation (PDI) in patients with ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM were shown in panel D.

### Associated factors for future pacing device implantation in wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy

In ATTRwt-CM patients (n = 114), 15 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 9, ICD: 1, CRTD: 5) (Figure 1A). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis for clinical, echocardiographic, and electrocardiographic findings, respectively, showed that IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients [IVS thickness: hazard ratio (HR): 1.394, P < 0.001; bifascicular block: HR: 5.031, P = 0.002) (Table 2). ROC curve analysis revealed that IVS thickness ≥16.9 mm [sensitivity: 0.733, specificity: 0.778, area under the curve (AUC): 0.809, P < 0.001] were independent predictors of future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3A).

Meanwhile, focusing on ATTRwt-CM patients with non-permanent AF (n = 82), 12 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 7, ICD: 1, CRTD: 4) (Figure 1A and see Supplementary material online, Figure S1A). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that in addition to IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters, PR-interval were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients (IVS thickness: HR: 1.358, P = 0.001; PR-interval: HR: 1.013, P = 0.043; bifascicular block: HR: 5.641, P = 0.004, the correlation coefficient between PR-interval and bifascicular block: 0.135) (Table 3). ROC curve analysis revealed that PR-interval ≥220 msec were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients with non-permanent AF (sensitivity: 0.750, specificity: 0.671, AUC: 0.704, P = 0.026) (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3B).

### Associated factors for future pacing device implantation in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy

In ATTRv-CM patients (n = 50), 14 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 13, ICD: 1, CRTD: 0) (Figure 1B). Multivariate Cox regression analysis with significant parameters in univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the levels of BNP in clinical parameters, IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients (BNP: HR: 1.010, P = 0.010; IVS thickness: HR: 1.284, P < 0.001; bifascicular block: HR: 11.537, P = 0.001) (Table 4). ROC curve analysis revealed that BNP ≥35.7 pg/mL [sensitivity: 0.917, specificity: 0.606, area under the curve (AUC): 0.785, P < 0.001] and IVS thickness ≥11.3 mm (sensitivity: 0.643, specificity: 0.600, AUC: 0.637, P = 0.153) were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients (see Supplementary material online, Figure S3C and D).

Meanwhile, focusing on ATTRv-CM patients with Val30Met (valine to methionine substitution at position 30) mutation (n = 36), 11 patients underwent PDI due to conduction disturbance (PM: 9, ICD: 2, CRTD: 0). The levels of BNP in clinical parameters, IVS thickness in echocardiographic parameters, and the presence of bifascicular block in ECG parameters were independently associated with future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients as well (BNP: HR: 1.018, P = 0.006; IVS thickness: HR: 1.303, P = 0.003; bifascicular block: HR: 6.310, P = 0.044) (see Supplementary material online, Table S2).

### Incidence of pacing device implantation in each conduction disturbance at diagnosis

However, to clarify whether first-degree AV block alone is really associated with PDI in ATTRwt-CM and whether first-degree AV block is really not associated with PDI in ATTRv-CM, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the incidence of PDI between normal AV conduction, first-degree AV block, and bifascicular block in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, respectively (Figure 3). The incidence of PDI in patients with normal AV conduction and first-degree AV block alone at diagnosis increased gradually in both the ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients (Figure 3A and B). However, the incidence of PDI in patients with bifascicular block at diagnosis was significantly higher compared with normal AV conduction or first-degree AV block alone in both ATTRwt-CM patients and ATTRv-CM patients (ATTRwt-CM: log-rank P = 0.012, ATTRv-CM: log-rank P < 0.001) (Figure 3A and B). After adjustment for variables with significant differences (see Supplementary material online, Table S3), bifascicular block was significantly more likely to result in future PDI compared to normal AV conduction (adjusted HR: 13.70, P = 0.019), but first-degree AV block alone was not (adjusted HR: 2.14, P = 0.511) (see Supplementary material online, Table S3and Figure 3A). Similarly, after adjustment for variables with significant differences (see Supplementary material online, Table S3), bifascicular block was significantly more likely to lead to future PDI compared to normal AV conduction (adjusted HR: 12.94, P = 0.002), but first-degree AV block alone was not (adjusted HR: 1.57, P = 0.701) (see Supplementary material online, Table S3and Figure 3B).

### Incidence of appropriate ICD therapies in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy patients

Among patients with ATTRwt-CM, 10 patients underwent ICD implantation and 6 patients underwent CRTD implantation for the primary prevention (n = 14) or secondary prevention (n = 2) of sudden cardiac death (Table 5). In contrast, three patients with ATTRv-CM underwent ICD implantation for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Under the number of intervals to detect ventricular tachycardia (VT) of 16–32, anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) was delivered only in one VT patient with ATTRwt-CM and one VT patient with ATTRv-CM, and subsequently, shock therapy was administered only in one VT patient with ATTRwt-CM, all occurring within 2 years after ICD implantation. (Table 5, see Supplementary material online, Table S4, and Figure 4).

### Discussion

The present study demonstrated that in ATTRwt-CM patients, PR-interval ≥220 msec, IVS thickness ≥16.9 mm, and the presence of bifascicular block were independently associated with future PDI. In contrast, in patients with ATTRv-CM, the levels of BNP ≥35.7 pg/mL, IVS thickness ≥11.3 mm, and the presence of bifascicular block were independently associated with future PDI. However, compared to normal AV conduction as a reference, bifascicular block was significantly favourable for future PDI in both ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM, but first-degree AV block alone did not significantly lead to future PDI in both ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM. Fatal arrhythmias leading to appropriate ICD therapy were also relatively low in both these groups.

Algalarrondo and colleagues have reported a first-degree AV block or a Wenckebach anterograde point of ≤100 bpm, and the absence of microvoltage on surface ECG as predictive factors for PDI in ATTRv-CM patients; progression to a high-degree AV block was seen 25% of prophylactic PDI cases during a mean observation period of 45 months.17 The above study included patients with the European form of ATTRv-CM, and reported a Val30Met mutation incidence of 61%, while in the present study, this incidence was higher at 72% (36 of 50 ATTRv-CM patients). This study included a large number of patients from the Kumamoto Prefecture, which is known to have a large accumulation of Val30Met mutation cases. The factors significantly associated with future PDI for ATTRv-CM overall in this study were the same as for patients with Val30Met mutations alone (see Supplementary material online, Table S2), but the parameters that predict future PDI for the entire ATTRv-CM patients might vary depending on the proportion of patients with non-Val30Met mutations.

Meanwhile, because the present study included more echocardiographic data, ECG parameters, and biomarkers compared with previous reports, we were able to identify the levels of BNP and IVS thickness as predictive factors of future PDI in ATTRv-CM patients in addition to bifascicular block. A previous study showed that the direct deposition of amyloid was observed in the sinus node and conduction system in ATTRv-CM patients,18 and another study demonstrated that in young-onset ATTRv-CM patients at the accumulation site of Val30Met mutation, amyloid deposition in the subendocardial myocardium including the conduction system leads to atrophy of the subendocardial myocardium and a high incidence of conduction disturbances.19 While it may be difficult to notice the progression of ATTRv-CM as opposed to ATTRwt-CM, in which amyloid is diffusely deposited throughout the myocardium, it is thought that amyloid deposition would also occurs to some extent outside of the conduction system in ATTRv-CM, therefore the levels of BNP and IVS thickness might reflect conduction disturbances in addition to bifascicular block, leading to future PDI, though its cut-off value may be lower than that of ATTRwt-CM. Additionally, the incidence of PDI in ATTRv-CM patients did not tend to be lower than that in ATTRwt-CM patients in this study (Table 1 and Figure 2D). Considering these findings, the levels of BNP ≥35.7 pg/mL, IVS thickness ≥11.3 mm, and the presence of bifascicular block in patients with ATTRv-CM might be important signs for future PDI. However, prophylactic PDI in patients with normal AV conduction or first-degree AV block alone at diagnosis for ATTRv-CM might not be necessary because the incidence of subsequent PDI was significantly low.

On the other hand, the background characteristics of the ATTRwt-CM patients differed from those of the ATTRv-CM patients (Table 1). The average age of ATTRwt-CM patients was significantly higher than that of ATTRv-CM patients, probably because aging is implicated in the onset of ATTRwt-CM (senile systemic amyloidosis).20 There were more men among ATTRwt-CM patients than among ATTRv-CM patients, as shown in the epidemiological data.1 It was observed that compared to ATTRv-CM patients, the ATTRwt-CM patients exhibited a thicker and stiffer myocardium, lower EF, and higher BNP and hs-cTnT levels. This probably reflected the deposition of amyloid in all of the myocardial layers in ATTRwt-CM patients. Previous studies have reported global late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in all ATTRwt-CM patients.21 Additionally, transmural amyloid deposition in the interstitium and vascular deposition around/within the intramural blood vessels led to subendocardial ischaemia.22 Eventually, it is thought that amyloid deposition affects the conduction system, resulting in prolonged PR-interval, and the occurrence of bifascicular block as in this study. However, in ATTRwt-CM in this study, the transition of PDI in patients with normal AV conduction and first-degree AV block was gradual; hence, there seems to be no need for prophylactic PDI in patients with normal AV conduction or especially in those with first-degree AV block alone at diagnosis. In the era of portable or wearable diagnostics (like smart-watches and others), ATTR-CM patients with bifascicular block should be encouraged and trained to use one of these tools in addition to electrophysiological study as described in the ESC guidelines5 to achieve a timely diagnosis of second- or third-degree AV block at its earliest appearance, resulting in PDI without delay or possible unwanted outcomes.

The rate of appropriate ICD therapy also depends on the type of amyloidosis (see Supplementary material online, Table S5). It has been reported that the incidence of ICD therapy in cardiac amyloidosis is as high as 22–28%,6–9 but these reports include a large number of patients with immunoglobulin light chain type amyloid cardiomyopathy (AL-CM); the rates of ICD therapy in patients with AL-CM are even higher at 29–36%, and extremely high at 75%, especially in secondary prevention patients.6,7,9 In contrast, the rates in patients with ATTRwt-CM are as low as 0–20%6,7,9,10 and in patients with ATTRv-CM are 0–33%.6,7,9 Furthermore, most of the ICD therapy occurred within 1 or 2 years.6,8,9 In the present study, appropriate ICD therapy was administered in 2 of 16 (12.5%) ATTRwt-CM patients and 1 of 3 ATTRv-CM patients; all three patients for primary prevention. Moreover, ICD therapy was administered within two years of ICD implantation (Table 5 and see Supplementary material online, Table S5). These findings suggest that the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in patients with ATTR-CM (both ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM) seems to be low compared to that in patients with AL-CM, regardless of primary or secondary prevention. Additionally, appropriate ICD therapy tends to occur within one or two years after device implantation, and might not occur subsequently. Because amyloid fibre deposition and myocardial fibrosis progress as amyloid cardiomyopathy advances, ventricular arrhythmia might occur at the stage where a low voltage area appears. In contrast, ventricular arrhythmia may not occur in the advanced stage when the scar area is widely spread and the re-entry circuit of the arrhythmia is not established. In ATTRwt-CM, transmural LGE was observed globally and an arrhythmia re-entry circuit may not have been formed. However, focal patchy LGE was found in the myocardium of AL-CM patients, which may facilitate the formation of a re-entry circuit, leading to ventricular arrhythmia.21 In contrast, in patients with early onset ATTRv-CM, amyloid fibre deposition in the myocardium is less, so this structure is relatively healthy. Therefore, scar tissue formation does not occur, leading to no ventricular arrhythmias. However, only one patient with ATTRv-CM underwent appropriate ICD therapy in this study. This patient exhibited a TTR Thr60Ala (threonine to alanine substitution at position 60) mutation; this is the most common mutation observed in the United Kingdom, and typically causes cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy.23 The incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in ATTRv-CM may vary depending on the mutation type.

### Limitation

Patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed with ATTR-CM at different times, and the follow-up periods were not consistent. Furthermore, some patients had a short follow-up period. Therefore, if the follow-up period had been long enough and consistent for all patients, the results might have been different. Bifascicular block may be also a predictor of the need for a PDI in patients without cardiac amyloidosis. However, to demonstrate a difference in the magnitude of risk associated with bifascicular block in patients with and without ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, a study in a matched control group for comparison would be necessary, but was not performed in this study. Furthermore, this study could not include the findings of electrophysiological study. If the electrophysiological studies had been performed in all patients, different parameters might have been identified as risk factors associated with PDI. The analysis regarding ICD therapy included confounders such as whether a CRTD vs. ICD was implanted, but was not examined due to the small number of ICD/CRTD cases. In addition, if the number of intervals to detect had been long enough, some ventricular arrhythmias might have spontaneously terminated and the incidence of ICD therapy might have been much lower. Finally, since the present study is a single-center, retrospective cohort study, with a small number of non-randomized patients, the results of this study do not change the indications for PDI.

### Conclusions

According to our retrospective single-center observational study, PR-interval ≥220 msec, the thickness of IVS ≥16.9 mm, and the presence of bifascicular block were confirmatory factors predicting future PDI in ATTRwt-CM patients, while the levels of BNP ≥35.7 pg/mL, the thickness of IVS ≥11.3 mm, and the presence of bifascicular block in ATTRv-CM patients. The incidence of PDI in patients with normal AV conduction or first-degree AV block alone at diagnosis is low regardless of ATTRwt-CM or ATTRv-CM, and fatal arrhythmias and appropriate ICD therapy also rarely occurred in ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients. Prophylactic PDI or ICD implantation might not be necessary for ATTRwt-CM and ATTRv-CM patients, but close follow-up based on associated factors is important, especially for PDI. Larger prospective, multi-center studies are necessary to confirm these results.
