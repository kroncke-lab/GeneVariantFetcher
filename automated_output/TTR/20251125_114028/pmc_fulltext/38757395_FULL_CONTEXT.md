## Cardiac amyloidosis is not a single disease: a multiparametric comparison between the light chain and transthyretin forms

### Abstract

AbstractAimsSystemic amyloidosis represents a heterogeneous group of diseases resulting from amyloid fibre deposition. The purpose of this study is to establish a differential diagnosis algorithm targeted towards the two most frequent subtypes of CA.Methods and resultsWe prospectively included all consecutive patients with ATTR and AL evaluated between 2018 and 2022 in two centres in a score derivation cohort and a different validation sample. All patients had a complete clinical, biomarker, electrocardiographic, and imaging evaluation. Confirmation of the final diagnosis with amyloid typing was performed according to the current international recommendations. The study population included 81 patients divided into two groups: ATTR (group 1, n = 32: 28 variant and 4 wild type) and AL (group 2, n = 49). ATTR patients were younger (50.7 ± 13.9 vs. 60.2 ± 7.3 years, P = 0.0001), and significantly different in terms of NT‐proBNP [ATTR: 1472.5 ng/L (97–4218.5) vs. AL 8024 ng/L (3058–14 069) P = 0.001], hs‐cTn I [ATTR: 10 ng/L (4–20) vs. AL 78 ng/L (32–240), P = 0.0002], GFR [ATTR 95.4 mL/min (73.8–105.3) vs. AL: 68.4 mL/min (47.8–87.4) P = 0.003]. At similar left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and ejection fraction, the ATTR group had less frequently pericardial effusion (ATTR: 15% vs. AL: 33% P = 0.0027), better LV global longitudinal strain (ATTR: −13.1% ± 3.5 vs. AL: −9.1% ± 4.3 P = 0.04), RV strain (ATTR: −21.9% ± 6.2 vs. AL: −16.8% ± 6 P = 0.03) and better reservoir function of the LA strain (ATTR: 22% ± 12 vs. AL: 13.6% ± 7.8 P = 0.02). Cut‐off points were calculated based on the Youden method. We attributed to 2 points for parameters having an AUC > 0.75 (NT‐proBNP AUC 0.799; hs‐cTnI AUC 0.87) and 1 point for GFR (AUC 0.749) and TTE parameters (GLS AUC 0.666; RV FWS AUC 0.649, LASr AUC 0.643). A score of equal or more than 4 points has been able to differentiate between AL and ATTR (sensitivity 80%, specificity 62%, AUC = 0.798). The differential diagnosis score system was applied to the validation cohort of 52 CA patients showing a sensitivity of 81% with specificity of 77%.ConclusionsCA is a complex entity and requires extensive testing for a positive diagnosis. This study highlights a series of non‐invasive checkpoints, which can be useful in guiding the decision‐making process towards a more accurate and rapid differential diagnosis.

### Introduction

Systemic amyloidosis represents a varied spectrum of diseases in which the accumulation of amyloid fibrils results in subsequent extracellular space expansion. The amyloid fibrils result from aggregating misfolded proteins and are inherently stable β‐sheet structures.
1
 Currently, over 40 precursor proteins have been identified and are known to form amyloid fibrils.
2
 Based on these precursor proteins, disease related extracellular deposition differs in terms of tissue affinity. Nine proteins are known to result in cardiac deposition and the two most frequently related to cardiac amyloidosis are immunoglobulin light chain and transthyretin.
2
, 
3

Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is characterized by accumulation of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains produced by an abnormal plasma cell clone.
4
, 
5
 This is usually a severe and progressive systemic disease, with a mortality rate of more than 40% in the first year of diagnosis.
6
, 
7
 Even though the mean survival in patients with AL has been significantly improved by developments of new treatment regimens, cardiac involvement remains the main determinant of disease prognosis. Thus, early diagnosis in AL amyloidosis becomes imperative.
5

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a progressive disease resulting from the accumulation of either variant (ATTRv) or wild type transthyretin (ATTRwt).
2
 Hereditary ATTR is the result of single base mutations in the transthyretin gene, while ATTRwt is considered to occur with ageing. Depending on the specific genotype, there is a high variability in ATTRv phenotype ranging from involvement purely of the nervous system to mixed or to pure cardiac phenotypes.
8
 In contrast, ATTRwt manifests predominantly as cardiac amyloidosis and has been described in up to 13% of patients over 60 years with left ventricle hypertrophy and heart failure with preserved ejection.
9

Cardiac involvement in both AL and ATTR usually presents as a biventricular hypertrophy with restrictive physiology. Currently, the diagnosis requires extensive testing through serum biomarkers, imaging, and invasive confirmation of amyloid infiltration in some cases. The first step in the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is clinical suspicion based on signs and symptoms, ECG, assessment elevated biomarkers, and echocardiography,
10
 with the use of cardiac biomarkers such as NT‐proBNP and high sensitivity troponin (hs‐cTn) in the diagnosis process of cardiac amyloidosis, being a central focus of recent studies.
11

Current recommendations have made the serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis and free light chain (FLC) assays a central part of the algorithms, especially when performed simultaneously with Tc 99 m‐DPD bone scintigraphy, as the confirmation or exclusion of AL amyloidosis represents a priority.

, 
12

Because the main objective in clinical practice is early recognition of disease, and given the more rapid deterioration in AL, recent studies have tried to establish a series of parameters based on imaging techniques to differentiate between the two forms of cardiac amyloidosis.
13
 Our study aims to establish a more accurate and rapid differential diagnosis algorithm and score based on a series of clinical, paraclinical, and imaging differences.

The derivation cohort of the score consisted of 81 of all consecutive patients with ATTR and AL evaluated between 2018 and 2022 in the Romanian cardiology centre. All patients were diagnosed according to current international recommendations and had either confirmation of amyloid deposition on extracardiac biopsy or had previously established non‐biopsy diagnostic criteria. The non‐biopsy diagnosis pathway may be used according to current recommendation from both the European an the American Society of Cardiology for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis and is based on positive Tc99m‐ DPD bone scintigraphy showing increased myocardial uptake in the absence of monoclonal gammapathy. This was followed by TTR gene sequencing to confirm the hereditary ATTR.

, 
12
 Carriers of TTR gene variants without cardiac involvement at diagnosis (no myocardial uptake on scintigraphy, no left ventricular hypertrophy) were excluded from the study. The validation cohort included a different group of consecutive AL and ATTR cardiomyopathy patients from both Bucharest and Leiden centres comprising a total of 52 patients.

In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all patients provided informed consent for anonymous publication of scientific data and local Ethics Committees approval was obtained.

All patients had a complete clinical, biological and echocardiographic evaluation including assessment of myocardial deformation, all performed within a 24 h interval. A complete blood count and basic biochemistry was performed in all enrolled patients, including serum creatinine value and the determination of the 24 h proteinuria. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated (eGFR) according to the standard CKD‐EPI formula (including the correction for race). Cardiac biomarkers N‐terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) and high sensitivity troponin I (hs‐cTnI) were also assessed.

All patients had a 12‐lead ECG at baseline. We evaluated the voltage to mass ratio, defined as Sokolow‐Lyon/LVM, as well as the prevalence of conduction abnormalities and atrial fibrillation at baseline. Furthermore, a 24‐h ECG monitor was performed based on previous findings such as the presence of supraventricular or ventricular extrasystole on ECG, atrio‐ventricular block, and history of syncope.

A standard echocardiographic exam was performed based on the European Association for Cardiovascular Imaging standardization documents using a Vivid E95 scanner with all conventional and advanced echocardiography capabilities (GE Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway).
14
 Conventional views were analysed offline using a dedicated software (EchoPAC PC version v203; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, United States). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by the application of Simpson's formula, based on the 4‐ and 2‐chamber views. Longitudinal systolic function and myocardial deformation was evaluated using 2D speckle tracking. Offline post‐processing for left ventricle (LV), right ventricular (RV), and left atrial (LA) strain measurements was performed using Echopac (GE Vingmed Ultrasound) by the same investigator.

The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. Numerical data are presented with mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD) for parameters with normal distribution or median and interquartile range (IQR) to adjust for skewness. For continuous variables with a normal distribution, the Student's t test was performed while the Mann–Whitney test was utilized for non‐normal distributions. The chi‐square test was used for categorical variables. Variables were considered significant at P < 0.05. We explored a series of biological and echocardiographic parameters to establish a diagnosis algorithm. For parameters having a P value under 0.05, we checked the discriminatory capacity based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and by calculating the Youden index. Cut off points were selected based on the Youden index (sensitivity − (1 − specificity). Parameters with AUC > 0.75 were attributed 2 points, while the others were attributed 1 point. The score was afterwards tested for its discriminatory ability on a second validation group including consecutive patients from both centres. Based on the scoring system, each patient in the validating cohort was attributed a score from 0 to 9 points, based on which we predicted a theoretical diagnosis: ATTR or AL. The data were then compared with the already established true diagnosis. A simple calculation of false positive and false negative cases and a contingency table were used to calculate the specificity and sensitivity in the validating cohort.

The initial study population included 81 patients, divided into two groups, the AL group (n = 49) and the ATTR group (n = 32). All patients with normal immune‐electrophoresis and free light chain serum levels had undergone sequencing of the TTR gene based on which 4 were diagnosed with wild type ATTR and 28 with variant ATTR. The Glu54Gln variant had the highest prevalence in the ATTR group (82%, n = 23), other variants identified being Ile107Val (n = 2), Glu89Val (n = 2), and Glu89Lys (n = 1). A baseline clinical and biological characterization of the study population is presented in Table

1
. Mean age was 50.7 ± 13.9 years in the ATTR group, 56% of patients were males, and 82% presented with the Glu54Gln variant. The AL patients were older 60.2 ± 7.3 years (P = 0.0001), had comparable prevalence of polyneuropathy (P = 0.529) but significantly less prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (P = 0.044), and more severe cardiac symptoms. In the AL groups, 73% of the patients had functional class NYHA II or more, with significantly more patients presenting with NYHA class III and IV symptoms when compared to the ATTR group (P = 0.039). Furthermore, patients with AL had significantly higher levels of cardiac biomarkers, both NT‐proBNP (P = 0.001) and troponin (P = 0.0002), as well as significantly lower eGFR (P = 0.003). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, optimal cut‐off values were selected, for cardiac biomarkers and eGFR. For NT‐proBNP the optimal cut‐off value was 4719 ng/L, which provided a sensitivity (Sn) of 71% and specificity (Sp) of 80% (Figure

1
A
). A cut‐off point of 27.5 ng/L for troponin yielded a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 93% (Figure

1
B
). The threshold value for eGFR was 71 mL/min/1.73 m2 (sensitivity 79%, specificity 58%) (Figure

1
C
). All cut‐off values were selected based on the Youden index.

Characteristics of the study population

eGFR, glomerular filtration rate was estimated; hs‐cTnI, high sensitivity troponin I; NT‐proBNP, N‐terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide.

LASr, left atrial reservoir strain; LV GLS, left ventricular global longitudinal strain; RV FWS, right ventricular free wall strain.

The electrocardiogram showed no significant differences between the two groups in voltage to mass ratio (ATTR 0.7 ± 0.3 vs. AL 0.7 ± 0.4, P = 0.9) or prevalence of atrial fibrillation (Table 
1
).

For the echocardiographic evaluation, we opted for a comprehensive study containing both basic morphology parameters such as wall thickness or presence of pericardial effusion, and advanced myocardial deformation study. As our two groups had similar maximum wall thickness (MWT) (ATTR 15.4 ± 2.8 vs. AL 17.1 ± 2.9, P = 0.112), our evaluation focused on parameters of global and longitudinal function. We used 2D speckle tracking to evaluate the systolic longitudinal function of both left and right ventricle, as well as left atrium function.

The main echocardiographic characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table

2
. At similar left ventricular wall thickness and mass, ATTR patients had significantly better left ventricular longitudinal function (P = 0.04, Table

2
), as well as better stroke volume (P = 0.036) but similar LVEF. Furthermore, ATTR patients had higher diastolic tissue velocities of the mitral annulus (P = 0.013), but both groups presented with similar proportions of patients with grade 2 and 3 diastolic dysfunction (88.9% of ATTR patients and 83.4% of AL patients). We observed that AL patients had a significantly higher prevalence of pericardial effusion (67.3% in AL patients vs. 46.8% in ATTR, P = 0.0027).

Echocardiographic characteristics of the study population

GLS, global longitudinal strain; LA, left atrium; LASr, left atrium reservoir strain; LV, left ventricle; LVEF, left ventricle ejection fraction; LVMi, left ventricle mass (indexed); RV, right ventricle; TAPSE, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.

At similar RV dimensions, the ATTR group showed significantly better longitudinal function, both in classic parameters such as TAPSE (P = 0.017), as well as on the longitudinal strain of the free wall (RV FWS) (P = 0.03). Furthermore, AL patients had at similar left atrial volume and ejection fraction (LAEF) (P = 0.126), more severe impairment of the atrial reservoir function (LASr) (P = 0.02).

Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve LV GLS, RV FWS and LASr had the best discriminatory capacity (Figure 
1
), and optimal cut‐off values were selected based on the Youden method. For LV GLS the optimal cut‐off value was −11.1%, which yielded a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 60% (Figure

1D
). A cut‐off value of −25.3% was selected for the RV FWS, which yielded a sensitivity of 93% but a low specificity of 34% (Figure

1E
). The threshold value for LASr was 15.4% with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 75% (Figure

1
).

A differential diagnosis score was developed based on the hematologic and echocardiographic parameters: NT‐proBNP, troponin, eGFR, LV GLS, RV FWS, LASr, and pericardial effusion. We attributed 2 points for NT‐proBNP >4719 ng/L and troponin >27.5 ng/L and 1 point for eGFR <71 mL/min and each echocardiographic parameter (LV GLS >−11.1%, RV FWS >−25.3%, LASr <15.4%), reaching a total of 9 points. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate each criterion's ability for classifying disease status as ATTR or AL, we observed that cardiac biomarkers had better sensitivity and specificity when compared with echocardiographic parameters. Different scoring systems were developed and evaluated for discriminatory capacity, establishing that the additional point for NT‐proBNP and troponin allowed the score to gain in both sensitivity and specificity thus showing better discriminatory capacity.

The decision to allocate 2 points for cardiac biomarkers and 1 point for echocardiographic parameters was based on the discriminatory capacity of the parameter, as mentioned in the Methods section.

The score demonstrated optimal discriminatory capacity on the ROC curve with an area under the curve AUC of 0.798 (Figure 
2
). Based on the Youden index, we selected a cut‐off value of a score of 4 or more points being able to differentiate between AL and ATTR with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 62%.

The differential diagnosis score system was applied to the validation cohort of 52 patients with cardiac amyloidosis; this cohort consisted of 15 patients with ATTR amyloidosis (4 ATTRwt and 11 ATTRm) and 37 patients with AL diagnosed in the two participating centres. A baseline characterization of the validation cohort is presented in Table

3
. The AL and ATTR groups in the validation cohort had similar age and sex distribution. There were also similar in terms of severity of cardiovascular symptoms, prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and neurological involvement.

Characteristics of the validation population

We scored the 52 patients according to the proposed algorithm with 2 points for the NT‐proBNP and troponin criteria, and 1 point for eGFR and each echocardiographic parameter. Each patient was classified as AL if the score was equal or more than 4 and ATTR for a score <4 points, out of the total of 9 points. Our prediction score had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 77%, with a positive predictive value of 90% and 58% negative predictive value, respectively.

The initial study population included 81 patients, divided into two groups, the AL group (n = 49) and the ATTR group (n = 32). All patients with normal immune‐electrophoresis and free light chain serum levels had undergone sequencing of the TTR gene based on which 4 were diagnosed with wild type ATTR and 28 with variant ATTR. The Glu54Gln variant had the highest prevalence in the ATTR group (82%, n = 23), other variants identified being Ile107Val (n = 2), Glu89Val (n = 2), and Glu89Lys (n = 1). A baseline clinical and biological characterization of the study population is presented in Table

. Mean age was 50.7 ± 13.9 years in the ATTR group, 56% of patients were males, and 82% presented with the Glu54Gln variant. The AL patients were older 60.2 ± 7.3 years (P = 0.0001), had comparable prevalence of polyneuropathy (P = 0.529) but significantly less prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (P = 0.044), and more severe cardiac symptoms. In the AL groups, 73% of the patients had functional class NYHA II or more, with significantly more patients presenting with NYHA class III and IV symptoms when compared to the ATTR group (P = 0.039). Furthermore, patients with AL had significantly higher levels of cardiac biomarkers, both NT‐proBNP (P = 0.001) and troponin (P = 0.0002), as well as significantly lower eGFR (P = 0.003). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, optimal cut‐off values were selected, for cardiac biomarkers and eGFR. For NT‐proBNP the optimal cut‐off value was 4719 ng/L, which provided a sensitivity (Sn) of 71% and specificity (Sp) of 80% (Figure

The electrocardiogram showed no significant differences between the two groups in voltage to mass ratio (ATTR 0.7 ± 0.3 vs. AL 0.7 ± 0.4, P = 0.9) or prevalence of atrial fibrillation (Table

).

For the echocardiographic evaluation, we opted for a comprehensive study containing both basic morphology parameters such as wall thickness or presence of pericardial effusion, and advanced myocardial deformation study. As our two groups had similar maximum wall thickness (MWT) (ATTR 15.4 ± 2.8 vs. AL 17.1 ± 2.9, P = 0.112), our evaluation focused on parameters of global and longitudinal function. We used 2D speckle tracking to evaluate the systolic longitudinal function of both left and right ventricle, as well as left atrium function.

The main echocardiographic characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table

. At similar left ventricular wall thickness and mass, ATTR patients had significantly better left ventricular longitudinal function (P = 0.04, Table

), as well as better stroke volume (P = 0.036) but similar LVEF. Furthermore, ATTR patients had higher diastolic tissue velocities of the mitral annulus (P = 0.013), but both groups presented with similar proportions of patients with grade 2 and 3 diastolic dysfunction (88.9% of ATTR patients and 83.4% of AL patients). We observed that AL patients had a significantly higher prevalence of pericardial effusion (67.3% in AL patients vs. 46.8% in ATTR, P = 0.0027).

At similar RV dimensions, the ATTR group showed significantly better longitudinal function, both in classic parameters such as TAPSE (P = 0.017), as well as on the longitudinal strain of the free wall (RV FWS) (P = 0.03). Furthermore, AL patients had at similar left atrial volume and ejection fraction (LAEF) (P = 0.126), more severe impairment of the atrial reservoir function (LASr) (P = 0.02).

Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve LV GLS, RV FWS and LASr had the best discriminatory capacity (Figure 
1
), and optimal cut‐off values were selected based on the Youden method. For LV GLS the optimal cut‐off value was −11.1%, which yielded a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 60% (Figure

1D
). A cut‐off value of −25.3% was selected for the RV FWS, which yielded a sensitivity of 93% but a low specificity of 34% (Figure

1E
). The threshold value for LASr was 15.4% with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 75% (Figure

1
).

A differential diagnosis score was developed based on the hematologic and echocardiographic parameters: NT‐proBNP, troponin, eGFR, LV GLS, RV FWS, LASr, and pericardial effusion. We attributed 2 points for NT‐proBNP >4719 ng/L and troponin >27.5 ng/L and 1 point for eGFR <71 mL/min and each echocardiographic parameter (LV GLS >−11.1%, RV FWS >−25.3%, LASr <15.4%), reaching a total of 9 points. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate each criterion's ability for classifying disease status as ATTR or AL, we observed that cardiac biomarkers had better sensitivity and specificity when compared with echocardiographic parameters. Different scoring systems were developed and evaluated for discriminatory capacity, establishing that the additional point for NT‐proBNP and troponin allowed the score to gain in both sensitivity and specificity thus showing better discriminatory capacity.

The decision to allocate 2 points for cardiac biomarkers and 1 point for echocardiographic parameters was based on the discriminatory capacity of the parameter, as mentioned in the Methods section.

The score demonstrated optimal discriminatory capacity on the ROC curve with an area under the curve AUC of 0.798 (Figure 
2
). Based on the Youden index, we selected a cut‐off value of a score of 4 or more points being able to differentiate between AL and ATTR with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 62%.

The differential diagnosis score system was applied to the validation cohort of 52 patients with cardiac amyloidosis; this cohort consisted of 15 patients with ATTR amyloidosis (4 ATTRwt and 11 ATTRm) and 37 patients with AL diagnosed in the two participating centres. A baseline characterization of the validation cohort is presented in Table

3
. The AL and ATTR groups in the validation cohort had similar age and sex distribution. There were also similar in terms of severity of cardiovascular symptoms, prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and neurological involvement.

Characteristics of the validation population

We scored the 52 patients according to the proposed algorithm with 2 points for the NT‐proBNP and troponin criteria, and 1 point for eGFR and each echocardiographic parameter. Each patient was classified as AL if the score was equal or more than 4 and ATTR for a score <4 points, out of the total of 9 points. Our prediction score had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 77%, with a positive predictive value of 90% and 58% negative predictive value, respectively.

### Discussion

In clinical practice, prediction models for the diagnosis of ATTR CA were developed specifically for hypertensive cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction,
17
 but limited prediction models are available for AL. Our study elaborated and validated a new score system which can be readily used in clinical practice to guide the differential diagnosis between AL and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis during the diagnostic workup.

Cardiac involvement in systemic amyloidosis is most frequently related to light chain or transthyretin forms. Independent of the precursor of the amyloid fibril, CA falls under the spectrum of restrictive cardiomyopathy, but the severity and the progression of disease is different between ATTR and AL.
18
 While extracellular amyloid deposition leads to LV hypertrophy in both ATTR and AL, free light chains may also present direct toxicity to the myocardium, partially explaining the presence of inflammatory myocardial oedema in AL.
19
 Furthermore, the severity of cardiac involvement in ATTRv varies significantly, depending on the specific mutation of the TTR gene.

Our study highlights the use of advanced echocardiographic measures as tools essential for differential diagnosis. Current recommendations on the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis from both the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association include a selection of echocardiographic red flags.

12
 Regardless of the type of cardiac amyloidosis systolic longitudinal dysfunction affecting both ventricles paired with increased LV filling pressures and potentially left atrium dysfunction seem to be always present. Furthermore, pericardial effusion or thickened valves and interatrial septum, may also raise suspicions of CA. We approached these echocardiographic findings with the objective of differentiating between AL and ATTR (Figure 
3
).

Echocardiographic images illustrating the differences between ATTR and AL cardiac amyloidosis. At similar MWT (panels A and F), transthoracic echocardiography showed in ATTR patients higher LV GLS (panels B vs. G), higher RV FWS (panels C vs. H) and higher LASr (panels D vs. I) and lower prevalence of pericardial effusion (panels E vs. J). LASr, left atrial reservoir strain; LV GLS, left ventricular global longitudinal strain; MWT, maximum wall thickness; RV FWS, right ventricular free wall strain.

Given the rapid progression of light chain amyloidosis and the increased mortality associated with cardiac involvement in AL,
6
 an accurate and early diagnosis is needed. Over the recent years, more and more studies have been directed towards risk stratification and prognosis in AL, highlighting the use of cardiac biomarkers, LV strain, or amyloid burden evaluated T1 mapping to assess extracellular volume using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).
21
, 
22
 Moreover, CMR has been shown to differentiate between AL and ATTR, with two different studies showing the severity of AL cardiac involvement when compared to ATTR
13
, 
23
; however, no definitive data is currently available to differentiate between the two entities based on CMR only.
24
 Considering the availability and cost of CMR, we proposed in the current study a more practical differential diagnostic algorithm.

Even the use of bone scintigraphy, considered as gold standard for diagnosing ATTR cardiomyopathy
25
 may result in false positive diagnoses (mainly in patients with AL cardiomyopathy, which can show myocardial uptake)
26
 but also false negatives (in some specific mutations).
27

The current study was performed in a specific population of ATTR patients. The Glu54Gln variant present in the majority of our ATTRv patients has a mixed phenotype, with clinical onset in the fourth decade of life, starting with paresthesia and carpal tunnel syndrome, but with significant cardiac involvement and autonomic dysfunction in the progression of the disease.
28
 This mutation has been described only in the Romanian population and has not been compared to other variants present in the European population, the most frequent being Val30Met, Val122Ile.

, 
29
 Given the delay in diagnosis up to 50 months in some of our patients, the cardiac involvement in ATTRv was significantly advanced in our study population (carriers diagnosed by familial screening were excluded from this analysis). In the current analysis, cardiac biomarkers and strain parameters describing the function of the left and right ventricle, as well as the left atrium were shown to have good discriminatory capacity, even when tested in a population with slightly different demographics.

A recently published study evaluated the diagnostic performance of cardiac biomarkers and proposed a rule‐in/rule‐out cut‐off value for both NT‐proBNP and high‐sensitive troponin T.
11
 When compared to the proposed rule‐in cut‐off values for NT‐proBNP, we noted that our patients presented with higher values, especially in the AL subgroup. This may be due to the delay in diagnosis when the disease has advanced significantly. Moreover, given that for similar degrees of LV hypertrophy, AL patients presented a more severe longitudinal dysfunction and increased NT‐proBNP and troponin, we hypothesized that the severity of the cardiac involvement may be a consequence of direct cardiotoxicity of free light chains.

As CMR becomes more readily available, a more complex characterization of AL and ATTR patients may be provided. By adding CMR parameters to the proposed score, the sensitivity and specificity of our model may further improve diagnostic accuracy. One of the CMR parameters proposed for the differential diagnosis has been LGE distribution, and Dungu and coworkers proposed a score consisting of transmurality of LGE distribution, age, and wall thickness.
13
 The findings, however, need further validation in an independent patient cohort. Moreover, the two patient cohorts (ATTR versus AL) were significantly different in terms of extent/severity of LV hypertrophy, (LVM 228 g in ATTR vs. 167 g in AL, P < 0.001), suggesting more advanced ATTR, which in turn could explain the more extensive LGE distribution. More studies are needed, because other CMR parameters such as ECV, global T1 or T2, may prove more valuable in both characterization of the amyloid burden and the prognostic value of different parameters.
30

The current study was conducted in a small number of patients, with a particular phenotype of ATTRv specific for our population. Although the score was validated in a mixed population from two different centres and two different countries, there was a small population of ATTRv in the validation cohort (11 patients). Given the lack of heterogeneity in the ATTRv population, we argue that our model would ideally need further validating on different ATTR populations.

Furthermore, our study population of both AL and ATTR patients had quite advanced cardiac involvement, shown through the elevated biomarkers and impaired longitudinal function. It should be noted that for incipient forms of cardiac amyloidosis our score may not be able to accurately discriminate between the AL and ATTR form. Given that strain parameters are highly sensitive for early diagnosis as well as biomarker elevation
31
 we believe that there would be possible to use the same parameters for the scoring system. Furthermore, left atrial strain has demonstrated diagnosis value in differentiating cardiac amyloidosis from other etiologies such as hypertensive heart or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
32
, 
33
 On the other hand, right ventricle strain has been demonstrated to predict long and short‐term survival, a cutoff value of <16% being proposed.
34
 As such, we do believe that there is room to further improve our scoring system for earlier stages of disease by adapting cut‐off points while the same parameters may be used.

In addition, we scored 2 points for cardiac biomarkers, both NT‐proBNP and troponin. Although values associated with episodes of decompensated heart failure were excluded, it is important to note that cardiac biomarkers and especially NT‐proBNP may vary drastically with congestion, renal failure, and obesity.
35
, 
36

It is also important to note that in patients undergoing haemodialysis, cardiac biomarker levels may not accurately reflect the degree of cardiac involvement.
37
 Although cardiac strain parameters are more reliable than LVEF and easy to obtain, there still remains inter‐ and intra‐observer variability.
38
, 
39
 Although inter‐observer variability was minimized by post‐processing the images and re‐measuring all parameters by the same investigator, still intra‐observer variability remains a limitation.

CA is a complex entity and requires extensive testing through serum biomarkers, imaging, and invasive confirmation of amyloid infiltration in some patients, as amyloid typing is essential for choice of therapy. This study highlighted a series of non‐invasive checkpoints, which can be useful in guiding the diagnostic process towards a more accurate and rapid differential diagnosis between AL and ATTR. The clinical impact of an early differential diagnosis resides in guiding further evaluation; when suspicion of AL cardiac amyloidosis is high, diagnostic tests including serum or urine immune electrophoresis and free light chain evaluation should represent a priority. A rapid and accurate diagnosis favours early access to treatment, which improves outcomes of patients with AL.
