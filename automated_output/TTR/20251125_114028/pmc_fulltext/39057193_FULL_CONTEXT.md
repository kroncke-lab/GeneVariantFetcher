## Water Plays Key Roles
in Stabilities of Wild Type
and Mutant Transthyretin Complexes

### Abstract

Transthyretin (TTR), a 56 kDa homotetramer that is involved
in
the transport of thyroxine and retinol, has been linked to amyloidosis
through disassembly of tetramers to form monomers, dimers, and trimers
that then reassemble into higher order oligomers and/or fibrils. Hybrid
TTR (hTTR) tetramers are found in heterozygous individuals that express
both wild type TTR (wt-TTR) and mutant TTR (mTTR) forms of the protein,
and these states display increased rates of amyloidosis. Here we monitor
subunit exchange (SUE) reactions involving homomeric and mixed tetramers
using high resolution native mass spectrometry (nMS). Our results
show evidence that differences in TTR primary structure alter tetramer
stabilities, and hTTR products can form spontaneously by SUE reactions.
In addition, we find that solution temperature has strong effects
on TTR tetramer stabilities and formation of SUE products. Lower temperatures
promote formation of hTTR tetramers containing L55P and V30M subunits,
whereas small effects on the formation of hTTR tetramers containing
F87A and T119M subunits are observed. We hypothesize that the observed
temperature dependent stabilities and subsequent SUE behavior are
a result of perturbations to the network of “two kinds of water”:
hydrating and structure stabilizing water molecules (Spyrakis et al. J. Med. Chem.2017, 60 ((16)), , 6781−68272847533210.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00057; Xu et al. Soft Matter2012, 8, 324–336) that stabilize wt-TTR and mTTR tetramers.
The results presented in this work illustrate the utility of high
resolution nMS for studies of the structures, stabilities, and dynamics
of protein complexes that directly influence SUE reactions.

### Introduction

Transthyretin (TTR) is a 56 kDa tetrameric
protein complex that
is often investigated due to its unique dynamics and its propensity
to cause disease. While TTR has been linked to amyloidosis, both wt-TTR
and the T119M mutant protect against amyloid-β toxicity.1 L55P and V30M mutations of TTR tend to increase
rates of aggregation in organs such as the heart and kidneys,2−4 whereas F87A and T119M mutations reduce the amyloidogenic nature
of TTR.5,6 Heterozygous individuals express both wt-TTR
and mTTR subunits, which give rise to hybrid TTR (hTTR) tetramers
that have also been linked to amyloidosis. Differences in propensities
for mTTR and hTTR complexes to form amyloid aggregates provide evidence
that subunit mutations shift tetramer dynamics, and it is possible
that further interrogation of these states can provide insight into
how disease progresses as well as how inhibitors that suppress amyloidosis
can be designed.

Environmental factors such as post-translational
modifications
(PTMs),7,8 ligand binding,9−11 mutations,12 and solution conditions (pH, temperature, pressure,
presence of osmolytes, and other cofactors)13−16 can alter a protein’s
complex structure, dynamics, and stability. An important factor that
is often overlooked is the role of hydration in protein stability
and structure. Xu et al. suggested that there are “two kinds
of water” around mutation sites on TTR: (i) water of hydration
surrounding stability-bearing mutations that have long residence times;
(ii) water adjacent to amyloidogenic mutations that exchange readily
with bulk water.17 Spyrakis et al. described
“cold” and “hot” water molecules in terms
of slow and fast exchanges with bulk water, viz., conserved water
more slowly exchanges with bulk water.18 Others have theorized that changes in hydration can modulate the
formation of monomers, dimers, and trimers that have been linked to
amyloidosis. An early study showed that pressure changes have strong
effects on hydration and packing that are crucial to the amyloidogenesis
of TTR mutants.13 Banerjee et al. reported
that conserved water mediated dynamics of the catalytic H88 residue
play key roles in the recognition of thyroxine and retinol binding
protein, whereas other conserved water molecules were linked to catalytic
and thyroxine binding sites.19 These studies
specifically link water to structure and dynamics as well as function;
however, the details regarding the role of water in these studies
were interpreted from crystallographic data and molecular dynamic
simulations. Experimental data probing the role of water molecules
in TTR stability could provide valuable insight into the dynamics
of the TTR tetramer as well as other TTR mutants. Wright et al. recently
reported on a novel NMR experiment to determine relative populations
of TTR species (tetramer ↔ dimer ↔ monomer) formed by
dissociation of a destabilizing TTR mutant (A25T), and their experiments
provided both thermodynamic and kinetic parameters including activation
energetics for dissociation of the A25T tetramer and enthalpy–entropy
compensation (EEC).20 Preliminary data
from our lab reveals that the charge state of TTR varies with temperature,
which we interpret as evidence that changes in the structure of water
alter the dynamics of TTR (Figure 1). These studies hint that water molecules could play
a key role in stabilizing the TTR tetramer; however, the role of hydration
on TTR stability is still largely a mystery.

Average charge state
(Zavg) values
for TTR tetramers at various temperature values. We interpret the
change in Zavg as evidence that hydration
plays an important role in tetramer stability.

Direct experimental studies of hydration are challenging;
thus
much of our insight about hydration comes from theory and simulations.
Here, we probe the effects of hydration of TTR by investigating the
effect(s) of temperature (cold and hot) on subunit exchange (SUE)
reactions. The data contained in Figure 1 reveal that the average charges of wt-TTR
and TTR mutants change as a function of temperature, presumably owing
to changes in the hydration of the TTR complex. Similar changes have
been observed in a number of other protein complexes, and such changes
have strong effects on the conformations of the complexes as well
as ligand binding.15,21,22 TTR tetramers disassemble and reassemble to form tetramers containing
mixed subunits,23−26 and it is possible that cold and hot water molecules present in
the crystal structure27 could influence
SUE by altering the disassembly and reassembly process (Scheme 1). The accepted mechanism for
SUE has been extensively debated, and numerous hypotheses have been
forwarded. SUE is illustrated using a mechanism introduced by Keetch
et al.: disassembly of tetramers to form trimers, dimers, and monomers
that reassemble to form TTR tetramers.23 Since then, several variants of the original mechanism have been
proposed. Foss et al. reported a disassembly mechanism for TTR where
tetramers disassemble into dimers and then into monomers.28 In 2014, Rappley et al. reported that the disassembled
monomers could reassemble into dimers and then tetramers.24 This hypothesis is consistent with our published
mechanism based on SUE studies of wt-TTR and wt-TTR subunits containing
amino acid tags on the N- and C-termini;26 however, in the study, a hidden pathway was uncovered showing that
dimers of TTR could be exchanged without disassembly into monomers
under physiological conditions. While these studies have provided
valuable insight into the SUE mechanism, details of tetramer disassembly
and reassembly, including the role of hydration, are not yet well
understood and should be further explored. In this study, we utilize
native mass spectrometry (nMS) to quantify hTTR tetramers formed spontaneously
through SUE, without the need for mass tags or isotopic labeling,
and our analysis provides information on the role of water in the
SUE process.

When “cold”
water molecules (dark blue spheres) that form the tetramer interface
are disrupted, tetramers disassemble into dimers and monomers. During
reassembly, interactions between the complex and water molecules re-form;
however, it must be noted that the water network of the new tetramer
may not be the same as the original water network.

### Materials and Methods

Tetrameric human transthyretin (TTR;
Uniprot P02766 residues 21–147) was expressed and purified
as previously described26 with minor modifications.
Residue numbering for the mutants of TTR was denoted based on the
post N-terminal signal peptide cleavage. Constructs containing TEV
protease cleavable N-terminal 6xHis-MBP-tagged (pET28b) fused to TTR
was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Colonies were grown in LB at 37 °C
until an OD 600 nm value of 0.6–0.8. The cells were induced
with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
and shaken at 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
and lysed on ice in the presence of complete protease inhibitor tablet
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)
using an M-110P microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Westwood, MA) at 20 000
psi. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20000g for 25 min. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.45 μm
syringe filter before loading onto a HisTrap HP column (Cytiva, Marlborough,
MA). The column was equilibrated at ambient temperature with 50 mM
TRIS-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, and 30 mM imidazole (buffer
A), and the bound protein was eluted with the same buffer supplemented
with 250 mM imidazole. The protein was immediately loaded onto an
MBPTrap HP column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated with buffer
A, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with
10 mM d-maltose. The 6xHis-MBP tag was cleaved from TTR by
incubation with TEV protease 5 mM β-ME overnight at 4 °C.
The tag cleaved proteins were loaded onto a HisTrap HP column equilibrated
with buffer A, and the flow-through containing tagless TTR was collected.
Tagless TTR was then concentrated using a 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal
concentrator (Millipore, Burlington, MA) and subjected to size exclusion
chromatography using a Hiload 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE HealthCare,
Chicago, IL) equilibrated with 50 mM TRIS-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 10%
w/v glycerol (pH 7.4) at ambient temperature. Peaks corresponding
to the tetrameric TTR were confirmed by mass spectrometry, collected,
and concentrated using a 50 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrator (Millipore,
Burlington, MA). Concentrated tagless tetrameric TTR was then diluted
with 200 mM ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) to concentrations ranging between
50 and 100 μM, and glycerol was added to reach a final concentration
of 20% w/v. Aliquots of TTR (25 μL) were flash frozen with liquid
nitrogen and stored at –80 °C.

To induce SUE between L55P, V30M, T119M, and
wt-TTR homotetramers, each solution was buffer exchanged separately
with Bio-Spin 6 SEC columns (BioRad, Hercules, CA) into LC–MS
grade water at pH 7 (Millipore, Burlington, MA) or 20 mM ammonium
acetate at pH 6.8 (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA) with a concentration of 1 mM was added to samples containing
coexpressed zinc before being buffer exchanged. Immediately after
buffer exchange, an absorbance value was obtained for the mutant and
wt-TTR solutions, and the solutions were combined so that the concentration
of each TTR species in the solution was 5 μM. Solutions containing
wt-TTR and F87A were combined so that the final concentration of F87A
TTR was 15 μM and the final concentration of wt-TTR was 5 μM.
Once combined, the solutions were incubated at either ambient temperature
(∼21 °C) or 35 °C with a MyTemp Mini Digital Incubator
(Benchmark Scientific, Sayreville, NJ) and were directly electrosprayed
at various time points.

All experiments were performed on a Thermo UHMR orbitrap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). The solutions were loaded
into custom pulled borosilicate capillaries pulled with a P-1000 micropipet
puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and were coated with gold using
a Leica EM ACE200 sputter coater (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
To obtain spectra of completely desolvated TTR tetramers, the spray
voltage value was 1–2 kV, the DC offset value was 21 V, the
desolvation voltage value was 10 V, and the in-source CID value was
50 V. In addition, the trapping gas pressure was set to a value of
4 and the HCD voltage was set to a value of 50–75 V. Data collection
was performed at either 25k resolution or 50k resolution. Spectra
were collected for 1–5 min, and spectra with sufficiently desolvated
tetramer signals were summed. Spectra were deconvoluted using UniDec.29 When deconvoluting, the mass range was limited
so only tetramers were present in the spectrum, the background was
subtracted, the mass was sampled every 1 Da, and the charge state
distributions were smoothed. The intensity values from UniDec were
utilized to make the histograms.

### SUE Involving Mutant and wt-TTR Homotetramers to Form Hybrid
TTR Complexes

To induce SUE between L55P, V30M, T119M, and
wt-TTR homotetramers, each solution was buffer exchanged separately
with Bio-Spin 6 SEC columns (BioRad, Hercules, CA) into LC–MS
grade water at pH 7 (Millipore, Burlington, MA) or 20 mM ammonium
acetate at pH 6.8 (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA) with a concentration of 1 mM was added to samples containing
coexpressed zinc before being buffer exchanged. Immediately after
buffer exchange, an absorbance value was obtained for the mutant and
wt-TTR solutions, and the solutions were combined so that the concentration
of each TTR species in the solution was 5 μM. Solutions containing
wt-TTR and F87A were combined so that the final concentration of F87A
TTR was 15 μM and the final concentration of wt-TTR was 5 μM.
Once combined, the solutions were incubated at either ambient temperature
(∼21 °C) or 35 °C with a MyTemp Mini Digital Incubator
(Benchmark Scientific, Sayreville, NJ) and were directly electrosprayed
at various time points.

### Native Mass Spectrometry Analysis of SUE Solutions

All experiments were performed on a Thermo UHMR orbitrap mass spectrometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). The solutions were loaded
into custom pulled borosilicate capillaries pulled with a P-1000 micropipet
puller (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and were coated with gold using
a Leica EM ACE200 sputter coater (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
To obtain spectra of completely desolvated TTR tetramers, the spray
voltage value was 1–2 kV, the DC offset value was 21 V, the
desolvation voltage value was 10 V, and the in-source CID value was
50 V. In addition, the trapping gas pressure was set to a value of
4 and the HCD voltage was set to a value of 50–75 V. Data collection
was performed at either 25k resolution or 50k resolution. Spectra
were collected for 1–5 min, and spectra with sufficiently desolvated
tetramer signals were summed. Spectra were deconvoluted using UniDec.29 When deconvoluting, the mass range was limited
so only tetramers were present in the spectrum, the background was
subtracted, the mass was sampled every 1 Da, and the charge state
distributions were smoothed. The intensity values from UniDec were
utilized to make the histograms.

### Results

To monitor the formation of hTTR tetramers,
both homotetramer states
and the three hTTR states for each SUE reaction must be sufficiently
resolved to be accurately quantified; however, due to the small mass
shift induced by TTR mutations, resolving hTTR tetramer states can
be difficult. The requirements needed to resolve mTTR and hTTR tetramers
relative to wt-TTR are illustrated in Table 1. Previous studies have utilized mass tags26,30 or isotopic labeling23,25 to quantify hTTR tetramers and
provide information on the mechanism and rate of SUE, although adding
modifications to TTR often induces mass shifts that overlap with adjacent
species23,25 or even alters complex stability.31 For example, Keetch et al. reported that the
16+ charge state (CS) of [13C–15N] labeled
wt-TTR overlapped with the 15+ charge state of [12C–14N]-TTR, making quantification of these tetramer states difficult.23 In another study, it was reported that dual-FLAG
tag TTR tetramers were more stable (i.e., less tetramer dissociation)
than wt-TTR tetramers, indicating that the dual-FLAG tag modification
may alter SUE results.31 Our nMS results
show evidence that, under our solution and instrument conditions,
tetramers and low abundance monomers and trimers are detected (Figure 2). Monomer and trimer
signals in the spectra are from gas phase activation needed to fully
desolvate the tetramers. Abundant solution phase monomer signals are
present in the F87A spectrum because of its instability in water.
Signals corresponding to TTR homotetramers have a resolving power
of ∼4000, and adduct signals are not abundant in the spectra.
This method allows for accurate quantification of hTTR tetramers and
monitoring of SUE reactions between wt-TTR and various mTTR homotetramers.
In this study, SUE reactions were induced by dissolving intact homotetramers
in water solutions unless otherwise stated, and nMS was performed
on the solutions at various time points. Concentration of TTR in solution
was based on the absorbance of all states in solution, which may account
for some variability in abundance at t = 0.

Mass spectra
and UniDec deconvoluted spectra for WT, L55P, V30M,
F87A, and T119M providing evidence that our method provides enough
resolution to separate wtTTR, mTTR, and hTTR states.

The L55P mutation has been linked to increased aggregation of TTR,
and hTTR tetramers with L55P subunits are presumed to be disease states
that accelerate amyloidosis. To characterize the formation of hTTR
complexes containing L55P subunits, a solution containing wt-TTR and
L55P homotetramers was incubated at equimolar concentration at ambient
temperature (∼21 °C) before direct electrospraying of
the solution at various time points (Figure 3A; Figure S1).
The histograms show evidence that, as time proceeds, signals corresponding
to hTTR complexes increase in abundance, providing evidence that SUE
occurs spontaneously in water. Furthermore, L55P homotetramers decrease
in abundance at earlier time points compared to wt-TTR homotetramers,
providing evidence that L55P homotetramers are less stable than wt-TTR
homotetramers under these conditions. At earlier time points, hTTR
tetramers that contain three L55P subunits are in greater abundance
compared to hTTR tetramers with one L55P subunit, which provides evidence
that disassembly of L55P homotetramers promotes formation of hTTR
tetramers. Furthermore, we interpret increased abundances of hTTR
tetramers at later time points to mean that hTTR tetramers remain
stable in water over time. At 6 h, the distribution of tetramers was
relatively Gaussian, providing evidence the SUE reaction was nearly
at equilibrium at this time point. Monitoring SUE between L55P and
wt-TTR homotetramers with nMS provides evidence that L55P homotetramers
are less stable than wt-TTR homotetramers and that hTTR states form
spontaneously within 6 h.

Histograms of relative abundance values for
wt-TTR, mTTR, and hTTR
tetramers present in 21 °C solutions initially containing wt-TTR
and (A) L55P, (B) V30M, (C) F87A, and (D) T119M homotetramers. The
relative abundance values provide evidence that SUE occurs spontaneously
in water and that stability of mutant tetramers dictates the SUE process.

The V30M mutation has also been reported to be
amyloidogenic. To
characterize formation of hTTR complexes containing V30M subunits,
wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers were incubated at equimolar concentration
at ambient temperature and the solutions were electrosprayed at various
time points (Figure 3B; Figure S2). Signals corresponding to
hTTR tetramers increase in abundance over time, providing evidence
that SUE between these homotetramers occurs spontaneously in water.
wt-TTR homotetramers decrease in abundance more readily compared to
V30M homotetramers, providing evidence that V30M homotetramers are
more stable in water compared to wt-TTR homotetramers. In addition,
the histograms show evidence that hTTR tetramers with one V30M subunit
increase in abundance more readily than hTTR tetramers with three
V30M subunits, providing evidence that, at early time points, disassembly
of wt-TTR homotetramers drives SUE. We interpret the abundance values
of hTTR tetramers at later time points to mean that hTTR tetramers
remain stable in water over time. Similar to SUE between L55P and
wt-TTR, a Gaussian distribution of tetramers was apparent at 6 h,
providing evidence the SUE reaction was nearly at equilibrium at this
time point. Monitoring SUE between V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers with
nMS provides evidence that V30M homotetramers are more stable than
wt-TTR homotetramers but that hTTR tetramers still form spontaneously
within 6 h.

Stabilities of TTR complexes containing L55P and
V30M subunits
are such that a Gaussian distribution of tetramers containing mTTR
and wt-TTR subunits is apparent within 6 h; however, it has been reported
that other TTR mutations more readily alter the stabilities of TTR
complexes. The F87A mutation reduces the stability of the tetramer
compared to wt-TTR, and due to the reduced number of contacts with
adjacent subunits, it does not aggregate as readily.5 To probe SUE behavior between F87A and wt-TTR complexes,
wt-TTR and F87A homotetramers were incubated at a 1:3 molar ratio
at ambient temperature and electrosprayed at various time points (Figure 3C; Figure S3). At time 0, signals corresponding to F87A homotetramers
and wt-TTR homotetramers are present in the spectrum. At 1 h, F87A
homotetramers decreased in abundance, providing evidence that F87A
homotetramers are less stable in water compared to wt-TTR homotetramers.
As time progressed, a signal corresponding to hTTR tetramers with
one F87A subunit and a low abundance signal corresponding to tetramers
containing two F87A subunits did appear, but a signal corresponding
to tetramers containing three F87A subunits did not appear. We interpret
the low abundance of tetramer signals containing F87A subunits to
mean that the addition of F87A subunits decreases complex stability.
Decreased stability of TTR complexes with F87A subunits prevents formation
of hTTR tetramers and progression of SUE.

The T119M mutation
has been reported to stabilize TTR tetramers.32 To probe the formation of hTTR complexes containing
T119M subunits, an equimolar amount of wt-TTR and T119M homotetramers
was incubated in a solution of water at ambient temperature and analyzed
at various time points (Figure 3D; Figure S4). The histograms show
evidence that hTTR tetramers do not increase in abundance as readily
compared to hTTR tetramers containing L55P or V30M subunits. Even
at 6 h, hTTR tetramer signals were not more abundant compared to their
abundance at 0 h. Furthermore, the histograms show evidence that both
T119M homotetramers and wt-TTR homotetramers are present in solution
after 6 h, demonstrating that hTTR tetramers do not form because T119M
homotetramers do not dissociate readily. Although many homotetramers
stay intact, we do observe that wt-TTR homotetramers decreased in
abundance compared to T119M homotetramers, providing evidence that
T119M homotetramers are more stable compared to wt-TTR homotetramers.
Analysis of SUE between T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers provides evidence
that T119M homotetramers are more stable than wt-TTR homotetramers
and the stability provided by T119M prevents formation of hTTR tetramers.

Shirzadeh et al. previously reported that higher salt concentrations
slow SUE.26 To determine how salt concentration
affects SUE progression, L55P and wt-TTR homotetramers were added
to a solution at ambient temperature containing 20 mM ammonium acetate,
and tetramer abundances were monitored over 6 h (Figure S5). The results show evidence that hTTR tetramers
formed spontaneously in this solution but were not formed as readily
compared to the formation of hTTR tetramers in water, which provides
evidence that SUE is hindered in higher salt concentrations. It was
also observed that sodium adducts were present when electrospraying
in 20 mM ammonium acetate, providing some ambiguity at early time
points. Similar observations were recorded when V30M homotetramers
were incubated with wt-TTR homotetramers in 20 mM ammonium acetate.
SUE in ammonium acetate shows evidence that hTTR tetramers did form
spontaneously but did not form as readily in high salt conditions
(Figure S6). We interpret decreases in
abundance of hTTR tetramers when ammonium acetate is inserted into
the solution to mean that ionic strength is an important factor for
tetramer stability and SUE.

Previous work by our
lab and others illustrates that changes in solution temperature can
alter the conformational dynamics of proteins and protein complexes
by altering the network of water molecules surrounding them.15,33 Changes in hydration can affect key characteristics of those proteins
such as enzyme activity and ligand binding affinity, among others.
To determine how temperature affects SUE behavior, a solution containing
wt-TTR and L55P homotetramers was incubated at 35 °C and monitored
at various time points (Figure 4A; Figure S7). The histograms show
evidence that SUE proceeds in a similar manner at 35 °C compared
to ambient temperature and that L55P is still less stable than wt-TTR;
however, abundances of hTTR states do not increase as readily at 35
°C, providing evidence that SUE is hindered at higher temperature.
This observation is especially evident at 2 h, which reveals a near
Gaussian distribution of tetramers at ambient temperature (Figure 3A) but not at 35
°C (Figure 4A).
A similar trend was observed for V30M. Monitoring SUE in a solution
containing wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers incubated at 35 °C provides
evidence that formation of hTTR tetramers proceeds in a similar manner
compared to SUE at ambient temperature, but formation of hTTR tetramers
is hindered (Figure 4B; Figure S8). This observation is especially
evident at 6 h, which reveals a Gaussian distribution for TTR states
at ambient temperature (Figure 3B) but not at 35 °C (Figure 4B). We interpret the observation that formation
of hTTR complexes containing L55P and V30M subunits is hindered by
an increase in temperature to mean that SUE involving these mutants
is sensitive to changes in hydration.

Histograms of relative abundance values
for wt-TTR, mTTR, and hTTR
tetramers present in 35 °C solutions initially containing wt-TTR
and (A) L55P, (B) V30M, (C) F87A, and (D) T119M homotetramers. The
relative abundance values show evidence that, in many cases, hTTR
formation is hindered at 35 °C, which we interpret to mean that
hydration plays a role in SUE.

Analysis of the mole fraction of each species in
solutions containing
wt-TTR tetramers and L55P or V30M tetramers further demonstrates the
temperature dependence of hTTR formation. The plot of L55P and wtTTR
at 21 °C reveals that the mole fraction of wtTTR and L55P homotetramers
decreases in abundance over time and that the mole fraction of hTTR
tetramers increases in abundance over time (Figure S9A). When the temperature is increased to 35 °C, the
mole fraction of wt-TTR and L55P homotetramers decreases at later
time points and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers increases at later
time points compared to 21 °C (Figure S9B). We interpret the decrease in mole fraction of homotetramers at
later time points at 35 °C as evidence that wt-TTR and L55P TTR
stability at 35 °C is greater than at 21 °C. Similar results
are provided for SUE reactions between wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers.
At 21 °C, the mole fraction of wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers
decreases in abundance over time and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers
increases in abundance over time (Figure S9C). When the temperature of the solution is increased to 35 °C,
the mole fraction of wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers decreases at later
time points and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers increases at later
time points compared to 21 °C (Figure S9D). We interpret the decrease in mole fraction of homotetramers at
later time points at 35 °C as evidence that wt-TTR and V30M stability
at 35 °C is greater than at 21 °C. The variation of species
mole fraction in solution as a function of temperature further demonstrates
that hydration plays a role in SUE reactions involving wt-TTR, L55P,
and V30M tetramers.

Temperature appears to be a determining
factor for SUE of L55P
and V30M with wt-TTR; however, it is not for SUE with F87A and T119M
mutants. A solution containing F87A and wt-TTR homotetramers at a
3:1 molar ratio was incubated at 35 °C and electrosprayed at
various time points (Figure 4C; Figure S10). The histograms
show evidence that, at 1 h, the signal corresponding to F87A homotetramers
was low in abundance. Over time, low abundance signals corresponding
to hTTR tetramers containing one F87A subunit or two F87A subunits
appeared. Abundance values for tetramers present in solution at 35
°C (Figure 4C)
do not change relative to tetramers present in solution at ambient
temperature (Figure 3C), providing evidence that temperature does not significantly affect
SUE behavior involving F87A subunits. Effects of temperature on SUE
reactions involving T119M subunits were also investigated. A solution
containing T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers at a 1:1 molar ratio was
incubated at 35 °C and electrosprayed at various time points
(Figure 4D; Figure S11). The histograms show evidence that
abundance values for T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers and hTTR tetramers
did not change over 6 h, which is similar to the results at ambient
temperature (Figure 3D). The fact that similar results were collected at 35 °C compared
to ambient temperature provides evidence that temperature does not
affect formation of hTTR complexes containing T119M subunits. We interpret
the inability for changes in temperature to alter abundances of hTTR
complexes containing F87A or T119M subunits to mean that SUE involving
these mutants is not affected by changes in hydration.

Analysis
of the mole fraction of each species in solutions of wt-TTR
and F87A or T119M further demonstrates that temperature does not affect
formation of hTTR tetramers. The plot of F87A and wt-TTR at 21 °C
reveals that the mole fraction of wt-TTR does not change, the mole
fraction of F87A homotetramers decreases, and the mole fraction of
some hTTR tetramers increases slightly over time (Figure S9E). When the temperature of the solution is increased
to 35 °C, the mole fraction plot does not shift compared to the
mole fraction plot at 21 °C (Figure S9F). We interpret the similar results at 21 and 35 °C as evidence
that SUE involving F87A is not affected by changes in solution temperature
under our conditions. Our results also provide evidence that SUE with
T119M is not affected by solution temperature. The plot of T119M with
wt-TTR at 21 °C reveals that the mole fractions of all species
do not change over the course of 6 h (Figure S9G). When the solution of the temperature is increased to 35 °C,
the mole fraction of the species in solution does not change (Figure S9H). We interpret the similar results
at 21 and 35 °C as evidence that SUE involving T119M is not affected
by changes in temperature under our conditions. The observation that
temperature does not affect formation of hTTR tetramers containing
F87A and T119M subunits further demonstrates that changes in hydration
do not affect SUE reactions involving these mutants at the given time
points.

Relative abundances
of TTR species in solution shed light on the SUE mechanism of TTR.
Mass spectra of solutions initially containing L55P and wt-TTR homotetramers
or V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers provide evidence for abundant monomer
products and lower abundance dimer products at each time point (Figure S12). Solutions initially containing F87A
and wt-TTR homotetramers contained abundant monomer products at each
time point (Figure S13). Solutions initially
containing T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers provide evidence for low
abundance monomer products at each time point (Figure S14). None of the spectra provides evidence for solution
phase trimers. We interpret the presence of monomer and dimer products
in the mass spectra to mean that SUE begins by disassembly of homotetramers
into dimer products that then further disassemble into monomer products
(Scheme 2). The high
abundance of monomer products compared to dimer products provides
evidence that disassembly of tetramers into dimers is the limiting
step in the reaction. The mass spectra also provide evidence that
hybrid dimers are present (Figure S15).
The presence of hybrid dimers suggests that assembly of hTTR tetramers
occurs when monomers reassemble to form dimers that then reassemble
to form tetramers (Scheme 2). It is worth noting that low abundance trimers are observed
in the high m/z region of the spectra,
but due to their low charge, they can be assigned as gas phase trimers
that are released during desolvation of TTR tetramers.34 We interpret the abundance of monomers and dimers
in the spectra to mean that the dominant mechanism for SUE under these
conditions proceeds by disassembly of TTR tetramers into dimers and
then monomers; the free monomers in solution then reassemble into
dimers that then form tetramers.

The abundance of hTTR tetramer species in solution
provides evidence
that SUE can proceed by more than one mechanism. Figure 3A reveals that, at 0 h, the
signal corresponding to tetramers containing two L55P subunits is
more abundant than signals corresponding to tetramers containing one
L55P subunit or three L55P subunits but is less abundant than signals
representing both homotetramers. This observation is also recorded
for the 0-h time point and 1-h time point in Figure 4A. This is also the case for solutions containing
T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers. In Figure 3D and Figure 4D, signals corresponding to tetramers containing two
T119M subunits are more abundant than signals corresponding to tetramers
containing one T119M subunit or three T119M subunits but are less
abundant than signals for both homotetramers. We interpret the observation
that hTTR tetramers containing two mutant subunits are relatively
abundant at early SUE time points to mean that SUE can occur by exchange
of dimers without disassembly into monomers (Scheme 2). This does not seem to be the case for
SUE between V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers and F87A and wt-TTR homotetramers.
In Figure 3B,C and Figure 4B,C, hTTR tetramers
containing two mutant and two wt-TTR subunits are not significantly
more abundant than hTTR tetramers containing three mutant subunits
or one mutant subunit. We interpret the abundance of tetramers containing
two wt-TTR and two mTTR subunits to mean that, for some mutants, SUE
can occur by exchange of dimer products between tetramers.

### Stability of Mutant TTR Homotetramers Dictates Subunit Exchange

The L55P mutation has been linked to increased aggregation of TTR,
and hTTR tetramers with L55P subunits are presumed to be disease states
that accelerate amyloidosis. To characterize the formation of hTTR
complexes containing L55P subunits, a solution containing wt-TTR and
L55P homotetramers was incubated at equimolar concentration at ambient
temperature (∼21 °C) before direct electrospraying of
the solution at various time points (Figure 3A; Figure S1).
The histograms show evidence that, as time proceeds, signals corresponding
to hTTR complexes increase in abundance, providing evidence that SUE
occurs spontaneously in water. Furthermore, L55P homotetramers decrease
in abundance at earlier time points compared to wt-TTR homotetramers,
providing evidence that L55P homotetramers are less stable than wt-TTR
homotetramers under these conditions. At earlier time points, hTTR
tetramers that contain three L55P subunits are in greater abundance
compared to hTTR tetramers with one L55P subunit, which provides evidence
that disassembly of L55P homotetramers promotes formation of hTTR
tetramers. Furthermore, we interpret increased abundances of hTTR
tetramers at later time points to mean that hTTR tetramers remain
stable in water over time. At 6 h, the distribution of tetramers was
relatively Gaussian, providing evidence the SUE reaction was nearly
at equilibrium at this time point. Monitoring SUE between L55P and
wt-TTR homotetramers with nMS provides evidence that L55P homotetramers
are less stable than wt-TTR homotetramers and that hTTR states form
spontaneously within 6 h.

Histograms of relative abundance values for
wt-TTR, mTTR, and hTTR
tetramers present in 21 °C solutions initially containing wt-TTR
and (A) L55P, (B) V30M, (C) F87A, and (D) T119M homotetramers. The
relative abundance values provide evidence that SUE occurs spontaneously
in water and that stability of mutant tetramers dictates the SUE process.

The V30M mutation has also been reported to be
amyloidogenic. To
characterize formation of hTTR complexes containing V30M subunits,
wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers were incubated at equimolar concentration
at ambient temperature and the solutions were electrosprayed at various
time points (Figure 3B; Figure S2). Signals corresponding to
hTTR tetramers increase in abundance over time, providing evidence
that SUE between these homotetramers occurs spontaneously in water.
wt-TTR homotetramers decrease in abundance more readily compared to
V30M homotetramers, providing evidence that V30M homotetramers are
more stable in water compared to wt-TTR homotetramers. In addition,
the histograms show evidence that hTTR tetramers with one V30M subunit
increase in abundance more readily than hTTR tetramers with three
V30M subunits, providing evidence that, at early time points, disassembly
of wt-TTR homotetramers drives SUE. We interpret the abundance values
of hTTR tetramers at later time points to mean that hTTR tetramers
remain stable in water over time. Similar to SUE between L55P and
wt-TTR, a Gaussian distribution of tetramers was apparent at 6 h,
providing evidence the SUE reaction was nearly at equilibrium at this
time point. Monitoring SUE between V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers with
nMS provides evidence that V30M homotetramers are more stable than
wt-TTR homotetramers but that hTTR tetramers still form spontaneously
within 6 h.

Stabilities of TTR complexes containing L55P and
V30M subunits
are such that a Gaussian distribution of tetramers containing mTTR
and wt-TTR subunits is apparent within 6 h; however, it has been reported
that other TTR mutations more readily alter the stabilities of TTR
complexes. The F87A mutation reduces the stability of the tetramer
compared to wt-TTR, and due to the reduced number of contacts with
adjacent subunits, it does not aggregate as readily.5 To probe SUE behavior between F87A and wt-TTR complexes,
wt-TTR and F87A homotetramers were incubated at a 1:3 molar ratio
at ambient temperature and electrosprayed at various time points (Figure 3C; Figure S3). At time 0, signals corresponding to F87A homotetramers
and wt-TTR homotetramers are present in the spectrum. At 1 h, F87A
homotetramers decreased in abundance, providing evidence that F87A
homotetramers are less stable in water compared to wt-TTR homotetramers.
As time progressed, a signal corresponding to hTTR tetramers with
one F87A subunit and a low abundance signal corresponding to tetramers
containing two F87A subunits did appear, but a signal corresponding
to tetramers containing three F87A subunits did not appear. We interpret
the low abundance of tetramer signals containing F87A subunits to
mean that the addition of F87A subunits decreases complex stability.
Decreased stability of TTR complexes with F87A subunits prevents formation
of hTTR tetramers and progression of SUE.

The T119M mutation
has been reported to stabilize TTR tetramers.32 To probe the formation of hTTR complexes containing
T119M subunits, an equimolar amount of wt-TTR and T119M homotetramers
was incubated in a solution of water at ambient temperature and analyzed
at various time points (Figure 3D; Figure S4). The histograms show
evidence that hTTR tetramers do not increase in abundance as readily
compared to hTTR tetramers containing L55P or V30M subunits. Even
at 6 h, hTTR tetramer signals were not more abundant compared to their
abundance at 0 h. Furthermore, the histograms show evidence that both
T119M homotetramers and wt-TTR homotetramers are present in solution
after 6 h, demonstrating that hTTR tetramers do not form because T119M
homotetramers do not dissociate readily. Although many homotetramers
stay intact, we do observe that wt-TTR homotetramers decreased in
abundance compared to T119M homotetramers, providing evidence that
T119M homotetramers are more stable compared to wt-TTR homotetramers.
Analysis of SUE between T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers provides evidence
that T119M homotetramers are more stable than wt-TTR homotetramers
and the stability provided by T119M prevents formation of hTTR tetramers.

Shirzadeh et al. previously reported that higher salt concentrations
slow SUE.26 To determine how salt concentration
affects SUE progression, L55P and wt-TTR homotetramers were added
to a solution at ambient temperature containing 20 mM ammonium acetate,
and tetramer abundances were monitored over 6 h (Figure S5). The results show evidence that hTTR tetramers
formed spontaneously in this solution but were not formed as readily
compared to the formation of hTTR tetramers in water, which provides
evidence that SUE is hindered in higher salt concentrations. It was
also observed that sodium adducts were present when electrospraying
in 20 mM ammonium acetate, providing some ambiguity at early time
points. Similar observations were recorded when V30M homotetramers
were incubated with wt-TTR homotetramers in 20 mM ammonium acetate.
SUE in ammonium acetate shows evidence that hTTR tetramers did form
spontaneously but did not form as readily in high salt conditions
(Figure S6). We interpret decreases in
abundance of hTTR tetramers when ammonium acetate is inserted into
the solution to mean that ionic strength is an important factor for
tetramer stability and SUE.

### Temperature Dependence of SUE

Previous work by our
lab and others illustrates that changes in solution temperature can
alter the conformational dynamics of proteins and protein complexes
by altering the network of water molecules surrounding them.15,33 Changes in hydration can affect key characteristics of those proteins
such as enzyme activity and ligand binding affinity, among others.
To determine how temperature affects SUE behavior, a solution containing
wt-TTR and L55P homotetramers was incubated at 35 °C and monitored
at various time points (Figure 4A; Figure S7). The histograms show
evidence that SUE proceeds in a similar manner at 35 °C compared
to ambient temperature and that L55P is still less stable than wt-TTR;
however, abundances of hTTR states do not increase as readily at 35
°C, providing evidence that SUE is hindered at higher temperature.
This observation is especially evident at 2 h, which reveals a near
Gaussian distribution of tetramers at ambient temperature (Figure 3A) but not at 35
°C (Figure 4A).
A similar trend was observed for V30M. Monitoring SUE in a solution
containing wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers incubated at 35 °C provides
evidence that formation of hTTR tetramers proceeds in a similar manner
compared to SUE at ambient temperature, but formation of hTTR tetramers
is hindered (Figure 4B; Figure S8). This observation is especially
evident at 6 h, which reveals a Gaussian distribution for TTR states
at ambient temperature (Figure 3B) but not at 35 °C (Figure 4B). We interpret the observation that formation
of hTTR complexes containing L55P and V30M subunits is hindered by
an increase in temperature to mean that SUE involving these mutants
is sensitive to changes in hydration.

Histograms of relative abundance values
for wt-TTR, mTTR, and hTTR
tetramers present in 35 °C solutions initially containing wt-TTR
and (A) L55P, (B) V30M, (C) F87A, and (D) T119M homotetramers. The
relative abundance values show evidence that, in many cases, hTTR
formation is hindered at 35 °C, which we interpret to mean that
hydration plays a role in SUE.

Analysis of the mole fraction of each species in
solutions containing
wt-TTR tetramers and L55P or V30M tetramers further demonstrates the
temperature dependence of hTTR formation. The plot of L55P and wtTTR
at 21 °C reveals that the mole fraction of wtTTR and L55P homotetramers
decreases in abundance over time and that the mole fraction of hTTR
tetramers increases in abundance over time (Figure S9A). When the temperature is increased to 35 °C, the
mole fraction of wt-TTR and L55P homotetramers decreases at later
time points and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers increases at later
time points compared to 21 °C (Figure S9B). We interpret the decrease in mole fraction of homotetramers at
later time points at 35 °C as evidence that wt-TTR and L55P TTR
stability at 35 °C is greater than at 21 °C. Similar results
are provided for SUE reactions between wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers.
At 21 °C, the mole fraction of wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers
decreases in abundance over time and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers
increases in abundance over time (Figure S9C). When the temperature of the solution is increased to 35 °C,
the mole fraction of wt-TTR and V30M homotetramers decreases at later
time points and the mole fraction of hTTR tetramers increases at later
time points compared to 21 °C (Figure S9D). We interpret the decrease in mole fraction of homotetramers at
later time points at 35 °C as evidence that wt-TTR and V30M stability
at 35 °C is greater than at 21 °C. The variation of species
mole fraction in solution as a function of temperature further demonstrates
that hydration plays a role in SUE reactions involving wt-TTR, L55P,
and V30M tetramers.

Temperature appears to be a determining
factor for SUE of L55P
and V30M with wt-TTR; however, it is not for SUE with F87A and T119M
mutants. A solution containing F87A and wt-TTR homotetramers at a
3:1 molar ratio was incubated at 35 °C and electrosprayed at
various time points (Figure 4C; Figure S10). The histograms
show evidence that, at 1 h, the signal corresponding to F87A homotetramers
was low in abundance. Over time, low abundance signals corresponding
to hTTR tetramers containing one F87A subunit or two F87A subunits
appeared. Abundance values for tetramers present in solution at 35
°C (Figure 4C)
do not change relative to tetramers present in solution at ambient
temperature (Figure 3C), providing evidence that temperature does not significantly affect
SUE behavior involving F87A subunits. Effects of temperature on SUE
reactions involving T119M subunits were also investigated. A solution
containing T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers at a 1:1 molar ratio was
incubated at 35 °C and electrosprayed at various time points
(Figure 4D; Figure S11). The histograms show evidence that
abundance values for T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers and hTTR tetramers
did not change over 6 h, which is similar to the results at ambient
temperature (Figure 3D). The fact that similar results were collected at 35 °C compared
to ambient temperature provides evidence that temperature does not
affect formation of hTTR complexes containing T119M subunits. We interpret
the inability for changes in temperature to alter abundances of hTTR
complexes containing F87A or T119M subunits to mean that SUE involving
these mutants is not affected by changes in hydration.

Analysis
of the mole fraction of each species in solutions of wt-TTR
and F87A or T119M further demonstrates that temperature does not affect
formation of hTTR tetramers. The plot of F87A and wt-TTR at 21 °C
reveals that the mole fraction of wt-TTR does not change, the mole
fraction of F87A homotetramers decreases, and the mole fraction of
some hTTR tetramers increases slightly over time (Figure S9E). When the temperature of the solution is increased
to 35 °C, the mole fraction plot does not shift compared to the
mole fraction plot at 21 °C (Figure S9F). We interpret the similar results at 21 and 35 °C as evidence
that SUE involving F87A is not affected by changes in solution temperature
under our conditions. Our results also provide evidence that SUE with
T119M is not affected by solution temperature. The plot of T119M with
wt-TTR at 21 °C reveals that the mole fractions of all species
do not change over the course of 6 h (Figure S9G). When the solution of the temperature is increased to 35 °C,
the mole fraction of the species in solution does not change (Figure S9H). We interpret the similar results
at 21 and 35 °C as evidence that SUE involving T119M is not affected
by changes in temperature under our conditions. The observation that
temperature does not affect formation of hTTR tetramers containing
F87A and T119M subunits further demonstrates that changes in hydration
do not affect SUE reactions involving these mutants at the given time
points.

### Insights into the SUE Mechanism of TTR

Relative abundances
of TTR species in solution shed light on the SUE mechanism of TTR.
Mass spectra of solutions initially containing L55P and wt-TTR homotetramers
or V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers provide evidence for abundant monomer
products and lower abundance dimer products at each time point (Figure S12). Solutions initially containing F87A
and wt-TTR homotetramers contained abundant monomer products at each
time point (Figure S13). Solutions initially
containing T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers provide evidence for low
abundance monomer products at each time point (Figure S14). None of the spectra provides evidence for solution
phase trimers. We interpret the presence of monomer and dimer products
in the mass spectra to mean that SUE begins by disassembly of homotetramers
into dimer products that then further disassemble into monomer products
(Scheme 2). The high
abundance of monomer products compared to dimer products provides
evidence that disassembly of tetramers into dimers is the limiting
step in the reaction. The mass spectra also provide evidence that
hybrid dimers are present (Figure S15).
The presence of hybrid dimers suggests that assembly of hTTR tetramers
occurs when monomers reassemble to form dimers that then reassemble
to form tetramers (Scheme 2). It is worth noting that low abundance trimers are observed
in the high m/z region of the spectra,
but due to their low charge, they can be assigned as gas phase trimers
that are released during desolvation of TTR tetramers.34 We interpret the abundance of monomers and dimers
in the spectra to mean that the dominant mechanism for SUE under these
conditions proceeds by disassembly of TTR tetramers into dimers and
then monomers; the free monomers in solution then reassemble into
dimers that then form tetramers.

The abundance of hTTR tetramer species in solution
provides evidence
that SUE can proceed by more than one mechanism. Figure 3A reveals that, at 0 h, the
signal corresponding to tetramers containing two L55P subunits is
more abundant than signals corresponding to tetramers containing one
L55P subunit or three L55P subunits but is less abundant than signals
representing both homotetramers. This observation is also recorded
for the 0-h time point and 1-h time point in Figure 4A. This is also the case for solutions containing
T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers. In Figure 3D and Figure 4D, signals corresponding to tetramers containing two
T119M subunits are more abundant than signals corresponding to tetramers
containing one T119M subunit or three T119M subunits but are less
abundant than signals for both homotetramers. We interpret the observation
that hTTR tetramers containing two mutant subunits are relatively
abundant at early SUE time points to mean that SUE can occur by exchange
of dimers without disassembly into monomers (Scheme 2). This does not seem to be the case for
SUE between V30M and wt-TTR homotetramers and F87A and wt-TTR homotetramers.
In Figure 3B,C and Figure 4B,C, hTTR tetramers
containing two mutant and two wt-TTR subunits are not significantly
more abundant than hTTR tetramers containing three mutant subunits
or one mutant subunit. We interpret the abundance of tetramers containing
two wt-TTR and two mTTR subunits to mean that, for some mutants, SUE
can occur by exchange of dimer products between tetramers.

### Discussion

The experiments conducted in this study
provide key information
on TTR tetramer stabilities and reveal that those stabilities dictate
how SUE proceeds. Both L55P and V30M readily exchange subunits with
wt-TTR at ambient temperature and form a Gaussian distribution of
tetramers with wt-TTR subunits within 6 h; however, homotetramer stabilities
determine which hTTR tetramers are formed at early time points. Homotetramers
containing L55P subunits are less stable than homotetramers containing
wt-TTR subunits, so disassembly of L55P homotetramers promotes hTTR
formation at early time points as is evident by the increased relative
abundance of tetramers with three L55P subunits (Figure 3A). On the other hand, V30M
homotetramers are slightly more stable than wt-TTR homotetramers,
so disassembly of wt-TTR homotetramers promotes hTTR formation at
early time points as is evident by the increased relative abundance
of tetramers with one V30M subunit (Figure 3B). Previous NMR data provides evidence that
the L55P and V30M mutations slightly perturb the β sheet regions
of TTR monomers;35 however, the overall
structure of TTR does not change significantly. Since quaternary structure
differences are small, it is possible that observed differences in
mTTR and hTTR tetramer stabilities are indicative of a shift in the
network of water molecules surrounding the complex in solution phase.
A previous TTR study involving mutation of H88 provides evidence that
alteration of the TTR water network destabilizes TTR tetramer structure.36 We hypothesize that L55P and V30M mutations
could also shift the network of water molecules surrounding TTR, which
would alter tetramer stability and formation of hTTR complexes during
SUE.

Other mutations prevent formation of hTTR tetramers. Tetramers
containing subunits with the F87A mutation are unstable in water,
which is illustrated by low abundance values of F87A homotetramers
at 1 h and only a moderate increase in hTTR tetramer abundance over
6 h (Figure 3C). Previous
studies provide evidence that F87 is involved in formation of the
transthyretin dimer interface by a packing mechanism with the adjacent
subunit27 and that displacement of the
F87 side chain from its binding pocket promotes tetramer disassembly.37 Removal of the phenyl group from the pocket
could disrupt the structure of TTR and destabilize TTR tetramers.
Destabilization would prevent formation of F87A homotetramers and
hTTR tetramers containing F87A subunits. Conversely, the T119M mutation
prevents formation of hTTR tetramers due to increased stability of
tetramers containing subunits with the mutation. The histograms show
evidence that wt-TTR homotetramers decrease in abundance relative
to T119M homotetramers over 6 h at ambient temperature, which we interpret
to mean that T119M homotetramers are more stable than wt-TTR homotetramers
(Figure 3D). A previous
NMR study discussing structural shifts of various TTR mutants provides
evidence that T119M perturbs the structure of a loop region near the
C-terminus, which differs from the region perturbed by L55P or V30M.35 Another study provides evidence that water molecules
cluster around that same loop region near the C-terminus of TTR.17 From the observations made in these studies,
it may be concluded that T119M shifts the structure of TTR subunits
and stabilizes tetramer formation. Stabilization of T119M tetramers
would prevent disassembly and inhibit their ability to undergo SUE
reactions with wt-TTR. Stabilities of tetramers containing F87A and
T119M subunits are such that hTTR complexes do not form through SUE,
and their altered stability could be the reason these mutants do not
readily form amyloid oligomers and fibrils.

One observation
we find enlightening is that changes in solution
temperature alter the formation of some hTTR tetramers, which we interpret
as evidence that water in solution phase plays a role in stabilizing
TTR. In the case of SUE between wt-TTR and L55P, relative abundance
values for hTTR tetramers are greater and relative abundance values
for homotetramers are lesser when the solution temperature is lower,
providing evidence that hTTR formation is promoted at lower temperatures
(Figure S16A). The same trend is observed
for tetramers formed during SUE between V30M and wt-TTR (Figure S16B). Changes in solution temperature
often induce changes in protein dynamics, which is frequently attributed
to changes in water structure.33,38 Previous studies by
Spyrakis et al. and Banerjee et al. detail the role of “cold”
water molecules (i.e., less dynamic water molecules) in stabilizing
protein structure.18,39 It is known that the dimer interface
of TTR is formed by hydrophobic contacts between the AB and GH loops
and a network of these cold water molecules that form hydrogen bonds
with the backbone of TTR and other residues.39,40 Previous research has revealed that temperature changes alter the
network of water molecules around TTR and that cold temperatures increase
hydration of hydrophobic regions.41−44 These studies provide evidence
that water molecules are important for TTR stability, and changes
in solution temperature could disrupt the network of cold water molecules
forming the dimer interface of TTR. Alterations of water structure
would compromise TTR structure and promote disassembly and subsequent
SUE. The observation that temperature alters abundances of TTR tetramers
during SUE illustrates that water molecules are an important part
of TTR structure and perturbation of the water network destabilizes
tetramers and facilitates SUE.

Temperature changes do not affect
SUE reactions involving F87A
and T119M subunits. In the case of SUE between F87A and wt-TTR homotetramers,
only small differences in tetramer abundance values are apparent when
the solution temperature is changed (Figure S16C). We interpret the observation that formation of hTTR tetramers
is not affected by temperature to mean that the network of water molecules
stabilizing TTR tetramers is already disrupted by the F87A mutation.
Disruption of water structure by removing the phenyl group would diminish
the effect temperature would have on the complex stability. Likewise,
small differences in abundance values are apparent at different temperatures
for SUE between T119M and wt-TTR homotetramers (Figure S16D); however, this is due to increased stability
of T119M homotetramers. T119M recruits water molecules to the dimer
interface of the tetramer.17 Those water
molecules could provide additional stability to TTR tetramers by resisting
changes in water structure. A more stable structure would prevent
disassembly of T119M homotetramers and progression of SUE.

Mass
spectra collected during SUE show evidence that SUE proceeds
by a disassembly/reassembly mechanism of tetramer species. The primary
mechanism by which SUE occurs involves disassembly of tetramers into
dimers and then monomers that then reassemble into dimers and then
tetramers. This mechanism closely resembles the mechanism proposed
by Rappley et al.24 and Shirzadeh et al.26 that both describe a process of disassembly
and reassembly of TTR tetramers. The inability for TTR tetramers to
disassemble or reassemble inhibits SUE between tetramers. T119M prevents
homotetramer disassembly and thus does not produce free monomers needed
for SUE to progress. Conversely, F87A prevents reassembly of TTR tetramers
once they are in monomer form and thus does not form tetramers to
complete the SUE process. The mass spectra also provide evidence that
solution phase trimer products are not present in solution. We interpret
the absence of trimer products in our mass spectra to mean that, when
incubated in water, tetramers do not disassemble into trimer and monomer
products. Even though we do not observe trimer formation in our study,
it is possible that, under other conditions, these states may form.

The histograms show evidence that a less prominent mechanism involves
exchange of dimer species without disassembly into monomers. Figure 3A,D shows evidence
that, at early time points, an abundant signal corresponding to tetramers
containing two mutant and two wt-TTR subunits is present providing
evidence dimer exchange can occur when L55P or T119M exchanges with
wt-TTR. Keetch et al. hypothesized that dimer exchange was part of
the SUE pathway and that it could occur by assembly of two free dimer
products or by formation of a hexamer product.23 In our mass spectra, we do not find evidence of a hexamer
product, so we conclude that free dimers in solution reassemble into
tetramer products without hexamer intermediates. This mechanism also
agrees with our previous work revealing a hidden mechanism involving
dimer exchange.26 Interestingly, dimer
exchange seems to only contribute to SUE for certain mutants. Figure 3B,C does not show
evidence of an abundant signal corresponding to tetramers containing
two mutant and two wt-TTR subunits, providing evidence that V30M and
F87A do not exchange dimers with wt-TTR. The reason dimer exchange
is present for some mutants but not for other mutants is not currently
known and warrants further investigation.

### Conclusion

Accurate characterization of protein complexes
with nMS can reveal
relevant information on their compositional entropy (i.e., the driving
force that facilities heterogeneity of protein complexes) and provide
insight into protein function, structural dynamics, and disease mechanisms.
Understanding how TTR compositional entropy develops may provide insight
into how TTR amyloidosis progresses. This study details an nMS method
that can be utilized to monitor SUE of TTR subunits between wt-TTR
and mTTR homotetramers without the use of mass tags or isotopic labeling.
Our results show evidence that the primary structure of TTR shifts
SUE behavior presumably by altering homotetramer stability. Mutant
homotetramers of L55P and V30M readily exchange subunits with wt-TTR
homotetramers within 6 h; however, our results provide evidence that
disassembly of L55P homotetramers promotes formation of hTTR tetramers
with wt-TTR while disassembly of wt-TTR homotetramers promotes formation
of hTTR tetramers with V30M. Mutations with more drastic stability
alterations (e.g., F87A and T119M) do not readily form hTTR tetramers
with wt-TTR, presumably due to alterations in complex hydration. Our
results show evidence that the SUE mechanism proceeds by disassembly
of tetramers into dimer products that then disassemble into monomer
products; free monomers then reassemble into dimers that then form
tetramer products. This mechanism resembles the one proposed by Rappley
et al. and previously by our lab.24,26 In addition,
the mass spectra collected hint that dimer exchange can occur for
some mutants (e.g., L55P and T119M), which is a mechanism that has
been reported by Keetch et al. and previously by our lab.23,26 However, other mutants studied (i.e., V30M and F87A) do not exchange
dimers, further illustrating that the primary structure of TTR mutants
affects SUE behavior. The results presented provide information on
the stability of TTR tetramer states and shed light on the mechanism
that leads to the formation of hTTR tetramers.

Our results also
provide evidence that temperature changes alter
TTR stability and formation of hTTR states. Specifically, mass spectra
collected show evidence that hTTR states are more readily formed at
ambient temperature compared to 35 °C in solutions containing
V30M and L55P subunits, providing evidence that TTR complexes are
destabilized at lower temperature. Previous studies have hypothesized
that “cold” water molecules can be integrated into protein
structures and stabilize protein/ligand interactions as well as protein/protein
interactions.18 TTR crystal structures
show evidence that numerous water molecules span the hydrophobic dimer
interface of TTR tetramers, which may help stabilize tetramer formation;
one study in particular determined that there are eight water molecules
that are integral in forming the dimer interface.39 We interpret the observation that decreased temperatures
promote formation of hTTR tetramers to mean that, at lower temperatures,
the network of water molecules stabilizing TTR homotetramers is disrupted.
Disruption of water structure promotes disassembly of tetramers and
begins SUE. Temperature dependence of hTTR formation highlights the
role water molecules play in the stabilization of TTR tetramer structure
and provides a rationale for TTR disassembly and progression of SUE.
The observation that disruption of water molecule structure can promote
hTTR formation may indicate that environmental factors known to affect
hydration (i.e., temperature, osmolytes, pH, chemical denaturants)
could play a role in progression of TTR diseases including amyloidosis.
